[00:00] Hello hello everybody welcome to this is like episode 5b I've been um adopting the naming nomenclature that AJ is already using seems like he'll number his episodes and then if
[00:19] he's working on something a couple episodes he'll add letters to them really this should be kind of like 6b but um at this point I'm not going to go back and make new thumbnails
[00:30] and everything for the one episode we did with with Ryan so there is a one episode out there in the ether that's not really that important because we have been trying to debug
[00:40] this code and it's been a challenge because we keep getting different errors seemingly randomly even right before going on here like literally two minutes before I was running
[00:56] the create identity script again that we've been trying to figure out and I got a brand new error I hadn't even seen yet I'm like all right great well I guess once again we're
[01:04] gonna not be able to do do the thing then I waited 60 seconds ran again and hey it worked so that's good it worked no idea why I think um you know this is kind of the nature of
[01:17] the the blockchain when you're dealing with this large decentralized network sometimes errors can be hard to trace back so totally get it you know no shade to to anybody out
[01:29] there working on this this is highly complicated tech but um yeah it's just you know it's it's hard when your code is broken and you don't know why and all you can really do is say
[01:39] hey does anyone out there know why my code is broken but since the code was not broken I have an identity ID now so I think we can we can move ahead with our tutorial and continue
[01:53] kind of rerunning it um I'm gonna share my screen let me just do one last quick check that I don't have anything on my screen that is bad nope nope there's a barely new computer
[02:13] so I'm trying to keep it locked down all right so cool let's hide this move that over there I always like to do just one quick check make sure I'm live now there we go great okay so
[02:40] let's get a little recap of kind of where we are what we've done and why oh actually real quick I know what I want to fix first I want to fix these screenshots um so this
[03:02] is our tutorial here definitely didn't mean to do that meant to zoom in there we go and uh so we've got where's the first screenshot there's no first screenshot I guess so this
[03:22] should probably be one okay let's see that should do it yeah great got the screenshots now I think there's gonna be one more down here I think there's a screenshot for the
[04:03] react server but I guess we'll get to that when we get to it okay that's fine um let me see great okay so this is a tutorial that I've been working on most of this I wrote
[04:39] back last summer when I was originally doing all of this stuff for dash make sure that's visible and yeah so if we look at kind of high level we have an introduction where we
[04:53] talk about what is the dash platform um if you're here watching this stream you probably have somewhat of an idea of what that is this is the javascript web-based new platform as
[05:05] being built out is currently only running on testnet so you can't really use this to push real funds to wallets or buy things out in the real world but we're working this out
[05:17] so that once we are on mainnet we have like good materials and example apps and things that people are going to be able to work with and so I started out by creating a node project
[05:31] with a couple little defaults this is one thing that is new from last time when I built this I still need to update that there we're now on a version for dev net dev test so this
[05:47] is basically you can think of this as running at latest and this is kind of like a canary or a next version or a whatever you want to call it so if you just install dash by itself
[06:00] you're going to get version three you want to make sure you're using the newest one this is one of the things that was suggested to me as I was trying to debug the errors and
[06:10] then we're set in type to module this is not in the official dash docs because I have rewritten all the examples to be in ESM instead of require and then here we got a whole bunch of scripts
[06:24] so what I've been doing is kind of like working through all these scripts that I had written and made sure that they still work and seemingly they all do kind of still work the only real
[06:35] change we made was here in the client there's this skip synchronization before height and that is not correct anymore so we thought that fixing and updating this number is what
[06:51] fixed our create identity function but both people in the discord were saying that's not actually the case and then I discovered myself just a couple minutes ago that is true we
[07:03] were still getting errors but they were different errors so you know hard to say exactly but I would say for people out there following along this is the number I got from a - core
[07:15] team member when I have gotten it to work it has been using this number so this seems to be the magic number for now I've got another change that I have is that if you look at
[07:29] all these scripts in the actual - docs they give you the client in there with the scripts I have decoupled out the client so it has its own file here and this is where you're
[07:42] going to sync your wallet mnemonic and things of that nature so after that we have a couple scripts that are just reading from the blockchain so this is our get block methods let's see
[08:04] that is like that yep and then when you run those you just get some kind of block numbers back and these are not super duper interesting so I'm going to skip past most of that then
[08:16] you got the create wallet and identity this is the really important stuff this is how you get a wallet and then start creating stuff on the blockchain so your create wallet script
[08:27] will run get wallet account set that to a variable and then export wallet to get your mnemonic back and then get unused address so you can get an address to send funds to
[08:42] then when you run the command you get this back and this is you know old very old wallet from when I first wrote this you need to then use testnet so let me be aware and testnet
[08:54] when you use it you're going to add in an address say you're not a robot hit get coins then you're going to wait and eventually the site is going to time out and then just go
[09:05] blank and give you an error that means it worked so after you do that you can then go to the block explorer and see that everything has worked as expected then the specific address
[09:26] that or the specific function that was really giving us issues was this create identity function and it seems here that so you see last time I ran it I was able to get this
[09:39] and then real quick this is probably not super duper necessary but I'm gonna try and keep as best as I can my wallet hidden I don't think it's really the biggest deal if it were
[09:53] to be seen but it just allows me to take one more thing off the list of things that might be broken if somebody you know hops on drains my wallet or something like that which I'm
[10:04] sure none of you streamers out there would do because you're all nice kind people right of course okay so we have a working identity ID now and just kind of depending on how far
[10:18] we get I may go back and kind of start filling in some of the some of like the explanations of this code you know because right now and like I didn't really talk about too much what
[10:29] an identity is I don't think so if we go up here yeah so there's not really a lot of terms defined right now in this tutorial I just want to get the code working first so we'll
[10:41] see how far we get at some point I'm gonna want to do that so I think right now we're on the retrieve identity so let's see how this goes now so now we've got our identity
[10:56] ID is set in our dot EMV and we're gonna run this identities dot get function and that's something I'm doing here is I'm destructuring out the platform and then running this you
[11:14] could do this as a as a one-liner if you want I like kind of like doing like this because then if you want to like console log the platform you could do that in here think things like
[11:24] that just kind of get some more visibility into your code especially when weird things are breaking and you don't know why okay let's see what's gonna go when I run this okay I
[11:42] think that worked it looks like it actually have a so I don't think I need this actually in my dot EMV so I'm not sure if I really want this same way of logging it out but I
[12:01] do know something I can do is I have this I have this gist or I just like keep useful little snippets and things as for curl that's probably not gonna work okay anyway let's
[12:20] keep let's keep moving on that works so okay so now we got retrieve identity ID this is going to be the specific IDs that I've got in my wallet if we run that we're gonna get
[12:41] back I believe an array of IDs I think there's only gonna be one so I've only created one so that right there is what was created up here okay so far this is all all making sense
[13:00] this is all working as intended which is very good now we've got top-up identity. These are some of the let me make a note this is a question I'd had last time we were doing
[13:37] this how credits relate to all this what they are so we got that there yeah identity credit balance that's good okay now register a name this is where we start to create something
[13:57] kind of akin to a domain name on your block or like an ENS Ethereum name service name things like that so there's your name here now this is taking in the identity ID and
[14:14] the label I don't create a label yet though I think I messed up something wait I think the label is the name you want to give it if I believe if I remember correctly let me
[14:34] just real quick go and check this section out identities and names register a name for an identity yeah identity name goes here there's a reason why I called it a label specifically
[14:58] I'm not quite remembering right now but I remember going back and forth I'm trying to decide how to how to name that variable back when I was doing this so let's see maybe it'll
[15:08] come come to me later but for now what I'm gonna do is I'm not gonna process that I don't want to go back in there I'm just going to do this and I'm gonna say stream test and
[15:26] I'm gonna give this 20 24 0 3 30 yeah that's fine that should be fine so let's try that now register name see what happens let me make a note to myself to actually explain
[16:00] that okay and it looks like it worked so that's cool that is very cool awesome so now that we have registered a name let's retrieve the name
[16:42] run name okay so I think I think I know what's wrong labels not processed I can't be anymore actually yeah let's let's hop off again and just put this in in the place where it goes
[17:11] which is a dot ENV okay just get that hard code out of there okay okay sorry for the bit of the screen switch in here this should work as expected now no no why is it null
[17:45] still no hmm okay so I'm gonna go back to my browser and I'm gonna go back to my browser. That is odd I should be getting this back okay okay let's uh do this first
[18:41] see if that helps still no okay hmm I think that might be an issue when we go forward because look at that this is the part that is displayed on your your front end the example
[19:17] as it goes on so let's make a note of that okay let's keep going though let's see what happens now we're in the the data contracts section so we're gonna do a register contract
[19:45] actually I'm gonna stop here and clean some things up in - examples I don't have too many too many notes here so let's start with first this one
[20:06] okay create a label in dot ENV with your desired name. I will be using... okay.
[21:00] Great great great great I had already known that this was broken yes that's right there it is there it is okay so I already knew that not sure why though maybe it's got hmm yeah
[21:26] okay anyway so that's probably fine then at least for now I think we'll be able to continue but I do need to figure out why that's broken at a certain point a bit more a bit more descriptive
[21:55] move it right here okay and then I wanted to also fix this part I don't want that hard coded of course
[22:34]let's push those okay okay so cool okay uh all right we're making making good progress making good progress here so we already got all right we'll create those yeah okay so
[23:03] let's refresh that register contract
[23:19] and let's fix that and here we go
[23:29] okay got an error so let's see if hard coding the identity id fixes it like it did last time
[23:54] no it did not unless let me try one more thing
[24:13] okay so same error no matter what okay so I'm gonna keep that there then keep this here because that seems to not actually matter and let's update this
[24:27] and it seemed like I had gotten these ones working in the past so I got a couple broken things in here now unfortunately but that is the nature of code when you leave it alone
[24:48] for a year stuff breaks so do something went wrong value error that's what I would need to figure out what is wbgptr
[25:15] mean okay I'm gonna keep keep plowing through I don't have an actual command to run this
[25:37] that's that do you do you? okay retrieve contract okay so let's see what we got here so we got okay that's the that's the wrong contract id because I can get a contract id and register
[26:13] a contract okay obviously so so to retrieve the contract you gotta be able to create it so that is a bit of an issue
[26:38] all right I don't think I don't think I need the contracts for the front-end example I built I think that the names are all you need so I'm going to just log that error the first
[26:54] error the error from register contract make sure that's taken care of okay that that was taken care of good okay so but I didn't push it
[27:15] okay so let's let's skip ahead a bit I think I want to work through the contract stuff with ryan on stream so if you're watching this ryan you're out there help help me I
[27:31] don't need help okay so let's skip all that and let's go to the express server out there here we're gonna make our api and so what I had done here is I had and this is where
[27:53] our stuff gets really complicated so I have an express server that is going to provide an endpoint that does these node scripts that were just running so that's that's pretty
[28:04] much how you should think about it and then let me just make sure this is probably not all exactly or maybe it is let's see this block hash get block block create wallet create
[28:22] identity retrieve identity retrieve identity ids update identity disable key top up identity register name retrieve name okay yeah so these do not have the contract stuff in them yet
[28:39] which makes sense as I was saying I don't think we needed those to get this to work so that's all fine so I'm gonna let that sit for now but I think yeah this is where I already
[28:58] have this but I had okay so I don't remember if I still need npm run all that's something I'm gonna have to kind of remind myself of but for now let's do this I'm just gonna keep
[29:16] both these in here so if I run either of them should work shouldn't be too big of an issue now let's look at our API server server.js which is gonna be up here yep okay and let's
[29:36] see what happens okay okay okay okay so we're gonna run this now but we're going to use our correct name which was yeah so I've done a couple onesie here so you see I got dash
[29:54] stream test I had a jcweb dev test that's a let's fix that right now that's that's obnoxious okay so we're gonna want dash stream there's a stream test that's what it was there we
[30:45] go okay okay that's all good and then dash a stream test okay that's fine already needs to be updated and that's from your that's your view component apparently vs code does
[31:21] not like the view syntax I need the view probably need one of these guys there we go much nicer okay um that's all good okay all righty we are pushing code people all right let's go
[32:02] back up here do okay and then refresh that okay so everything is running as planned I should be able to hit this and get my name back check make sure that's all good okay
[32:35] look at that what is all this okay it worked awesome awesome okay that's killer okay so I think we should be good to go all the way up to the end of this react example if that
[33:06] is all the case a couple things I'm gonna want to figure out I just I just had it hold on oh I want um to update update express server commands to use node 20 features including
[33:33] watch and env flags so this is pretty cool you no longer need node mod and dot env if you're using node 20 so that's something I'm gonna wanna fix all right so let's let's keep
[33:56] on keeping on that so now what we're doing let me let me explain what's happening now real quick so and you know no one's really talking in the in the chat so I'm gonna close
[34:12] this and then check it when when I finish in like 15 minutes or so let me fix these this ridiculous window setup I've had this whole stream okay this is a little nicer okay
[34:27] so now what's happening is we've got kind of like um I think this is considered a mono repo setup I am nesting my front ends in with the scripts and the API so I kind of like
[34:44] this structure cuz it separates out there's like the base scripts which you can just kind of run as I've been showing and then there's your your API which is your back end and then
[34:57] there's your your front end you know if you really wanted to get nuts with it you could create like a front end folder that then nests all these folders that's probably a bit more
[35:09] than is really necessary because then you're kind of the more deeply nested you get the more complicated things tend to be so I'm gonna keep it keep this structure like this
[35:20] until anyone tells me otherwise and then once you do all that so I'm using just a kind of vanilla reactive beat setup here and then we want we don't want these scripts and all
[35:45] this info okay so let's go from here up let's go dash react sample okay and you know this all this stuff you look here on beat 5 instead of beat 4 we're on a slightly updated plug-in
[36:20] there may be things that could be updated here to make this cleaner and you know I kind of decided to build this app piece by piece really what I should probably do in this tutorial
[36:30] is just run your your beat create command and just generate all this by itself but you know it is kind of a nice exercise to go through create your your whole index index.html page
[36:45] your main function your app function your CSS it's it's meditative always it reminds me I'm a reactive okay so let's just get all this code in here get your app.jsx in here
[37:07] we got that in there that's correct add some CSS styling okay I think that going to let us hold on actually whoa whoa whoa whoa wait don't forget you gotta have your server running
[37:33] okay let's see what happens okay now but there we go great so what we have here is the the name that I registered being returned and this is this is different this has way more
[37:57] information than it did last time so that's really interesting last time this was a whole bunch of this stuff was not here that's why I was a little confused when I first ran the
[38:12] the node script and it gave me like this huge huge output so we'll be kind of curious to ask Ryan what all this extra information is and whether I actually need it or not you
[38:24] know I I can definitely see there's something going on with some regular expression stuff domain name convert to lowercase for cases as if you think this is validation so this
[38:34] might just be kind of cover your butt stuff that's been built in to handle all the complexities of you know routing domain naming that type stuff but um this is all great this is all
[38:50] super super great so now we want a fetch button so let's update this and now what's gonna happen is there's gonna be a button that can press we'll fetch the data with a nice little
[39:08] loader and it's um formatted a bit more nicely so now we can kind of actually read the hex going on here CSS is still being approved we're running off the page here but um okay
[39:23] so we have gotten ourselves back to where we were in the beginning and I'm seeing here ah there we go I'm also seeing here that I didn't give any of the instructions for actually
[39:36] installing the view things um because I wasn't really sure how many of the front ends to include in this tutorial because over in our actual dash examples monorepo you can see
[39:57] here I'd already built out a whole bunch of these view spelt solid react preact angular I should really get rid of preact I don't think anyone uses preact anymore um I'll ask
[40:12] Ryan about that actually we got a couple notes I need to make do we really need preact um how many front ends do do we actually want to build out in this tutorial do we want extra
[40:34] tutorials for each front end framework or do we just want the dash examples repo with simple commands to spin up okay um all right feeling good feeling good about this stream
[41:00] I think um I think we made a lot of progress in terms of getting ourselves back to where we were when I left off last summer we still got some broken node scripts and our whole
[41:15] kind of data contract section is totally busted but um that's kind of things I think I want to work through with Ryan and then other stuff in the examples I want to work through so
[41:31] let me just take a few of those a few of those loose ends that I had still and I want to update so we can close that still no comments dash examples so let's go fix this image whoops
[41:56] don't do that okay I think we were on um four so yes this will be screenshot four that's why I had the question marks I wasn't sure and this will need a update screenshot okay
[42:35] and then I'm gonna just drop some of these in into the tutorial so I go through it next time probably off screen I'll be fixing some of these things and I think at the very least
[42:56] since I have the whole mono repo thing set up in this tutorial we should do at least two front ends so it makes sense otherwise it's like why is the react thing called react
[43:11] in a react folder it doesn't really make as much sense include actually this I can just copy paste most of what I did up here okay um actually I can even do that I just need
[43:44] to know what was in here great great great no view dom of course great well it looks like um these can be dev dependencies so let's do this okay um and then I also want to make
[44:30] sure I have this saved as well so let's get back here um getting it let's see if I've done everything correctly it looks like no no no modules no dot emvs that's all good
[44:50] okay um cool great all right I think I documented all my questions gave myself a bunch of to-dos in my tutorial to update and yeah Ryan if you're watching this um I would like to have
[45:21] you on next time I do a stream um to kind of work out some of these higher level questions I have and then hopefully you can help me debug or at least get in the right direction
[45:34] of debugging the couple things that are still broken um let me just make sure I can get this here um okay awesome let's stop screen sharing okay cool um not sure how many people
[45:54] out there were watching this but if you were thanks for joining hope this was um interesting or useful for you in some respects you know these kind of just like co-working live streaming
[46:07] I had gone back and watched some of my streams from the summer and I was very glad I had streamed them because I had forgotten so many things but um yeah so don't have a specific
[46:19] date in mind yet but um Monday we're gonna be back with Incubator Weekly um hopefully getting on I think we had a guest to talk about some decentralized storage type stuff
[46:31] I may be wrong about that but that was the last thing I think we had talked about and then sometime mid-week I'll try and work out when Ryan and I can hop on again to work through
[46:42] more of this tutorial so I would guess probably Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday one of those dates but um yeah I'm gonna call it here thank you everyone who watched and we'll catch you
[46:54] next time. [BLANK_AUDIO]
