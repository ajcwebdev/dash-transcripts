[12:45] - Hello, hello, hello, and welcome back.
[12:48] So, the good news is that there's good news.
[12:52] The bad news is that last time,
[12:54] my audio didn't get captured at all.
[12:56] 'Til halfway through when somebody finally said,
[12:58] "Hey, did you know your audio is not on?"
[13:00] So this time, what I've done to try to rectify that,
[13:04] and I'll see if I can get this in here real quick.
[13:07] Just one second.
[13:08] 'Cause I was waiting for it to change scenes
[13:10] before I do this.
[13:11] So I'm actually, as far as the audio goes,
[13:16] there we go.
[13:24] So I'm bringing in a duplicate device,
[13:27] duplicate audio device.
[13:28] I'm gonna put some of the same settings on it.
[13:33] If I can, oh, oh.
[13:39] - Bear with me while there might be an echo.
[13:41] A slight delay here.
[13:47] I just need to copy some settings over
[13:49] before we get started.
[13:50] Hopefully to prevent this problem again.
[13:52] So what happens is OBS, it just randomly forgets
[13:56] which monitors are being captured
[13:58] and what audio devices are being captured,
[14:00] and so, well, I guess it's not randomly.
[14:02] When they get unplugged and re-plugged,
[14:04] it sometimes remembers and sometimes forgets,
[14:07] and then, you know, it's just terrible.
[14:09] All right, so we're gonna put a delay here
[14:11] of 250 milliseconds to match the other one,
[14:14] and I'm gonna put some filters on, just one second.
[14:17] So let's check filters.
[14:18] So this one has RNN noise.
[14:21] Actually, that's not turned on.
[14:22] It's got compressor 36666.
[14:27] Okay, let's turn the compressor on over here.
[14:30] Filters, compressor, which is at,
[14:35] let's take that down to three.
[14:38] Six, whoops, six.
[14:43] What in the world?
[14:45] All right.
[14:54] Three, 660, and then six, there we go.
[15:04] And I'm gonna just double-check this,
[15:08] and then we'll get started here.
[15:08] So what I'm gonna be working on is,
[15:11] last night, I got so close and yet so far
[15:14] on finishing up this process with replacing,
[15:19] with getting HDKey, the HDKey module,
[15:25] to be able to work in the browser.
[15:27] Really, really close.
[15:28] Okay, three, negative six, 6666, okay.
[15:34] I think I got that, three, negative six, 6666.
[15:38] And then threshold is negative three and 60 on the limiter.
[15:42] So let me just add that real quick.
[15:44] So limiter is negative three and, whoops,
[15:52] negative three and 60, and then one more change,
[15:58] and then we'll go ahead and get started.
[15:59] How's everybody doing, by the way?
[16:01] Good morning.
[16:02] (upbeat music)
[16:05] Okay, noise gate, I don't actually want the noise gate.
[16:09] No, not noise gate.
[16:11] Delete, delete.
[16:12] Let's see, noise suppression, good quality, more CPU.
[16:27] Do, do, do.
[16:28] So, as long as I've got audio going,
[16:36] the noise suppression isn't too bad,
[16:37] but if there's audio going, that's really annoying.
[16:39] I don't like it.
[16:40] Hold on, and we gotta turn the heaters down to low.
[16:43] Okay, now we're ready to go.
[16:48] Pop it out, my friends.
[16:49] Let's open up can of Focus and get going here.
[16:54] Pop, there we go.
[16:56] (upbeat music)
[16:58] And then I can remove entirely this mic.
[17:07] Let's just remove it.
[17:08] There we go.
[17:11] And I am going to turn off the noise suppression for now.
[17:17] Let me know if that sounds better or worse.
[17:21] I tend to not like noise suppression when it can be avoided.
[17:25] I think noise suppression is a necessary evil at times,
[17:30] but I don't think it's necessary right now
[17:32] 'cause we got background music, so that's good.
[17:36] Anyway, yeah, feel free to say hello, ask questions,
[17:39] ask about what we're working on,
[17:41] and ask about what you're working on.
[17:43] I do sometimes do little 10 minute detours of conversation
[17:47] and whatnot while I'm working.
[17:49] But the next bit here is we need to get SecP256K1
[17:55] replaced in here.
[17:57] And this is starting, it's starting to look kind of nasty.
[18:00] There's, well, we'll see.
[18:02] I did wanna check one thing before I actually go into that.
[18:06] So one of the things that I discovered
[18:09] was that, what is it, RipeMD?
[18:13] One of these things uses TextEncoder,
[18:16] and that's the only thing about it that breaks node 10.
[18:24] UTF-8 encoder,
[18:26] and
[18:30] let's see, extended keys, passphrase stuff,
[18:40] update UN8array.
[18:45] I think I'm just gonna not allow UN8array.
[18:48] Because if we just don't allow UN8array,
[18:53] (keyboard clicking)
[18:56] let's see, what's array 16 here?
[18:58] Words.
[19:02] I don't know what that's being used for.
[19:09] And what's the point of this?
[19:10] Oh, this is just so it allocates it.
[19:14] So this is using an allocation trick.
[19:16] It allocates an array ahead of time
[19:19] so that it's only allocated once.
[19:20] That's a performance optimization trick
[19:23] that can be a pretty good one.
[19:24] Okay.
[19:28] Interesting.
[19:33] Got it, got it.
[19:36] And I don't think I use RipeMD
[19:45] in a way that
[19:48] (keyboard clicking)
[19:51] um, where did this one come from too?
[19:55] Do I have a note here?
[19:56] Oh, it comes from Crypto Browserify.
[19:59] So this is not the hash-based version.
[20:04] And I'm actually perfectly okay
[20:18] (keyboard clicking)
[20:19] with saying,
[20:20] let UTF-8 encoder
[20:26] equals new text encoder.
[20:29] And then just UTF-8 encoder dot encode.
[20:35] Yep, there we go.
[20:38] No need to pull that dependency to the inside.
[20:41] (keyboard clicking)
[20:44] Wait, what's my paste buffer there?
[20:55] Nothing important.
[20:56] Okay, good.
[20:56] Let's see here.
[21:04] (keyboard clicking)
[21:11] Message is 42.
[21:12] Encode message, update buffer.
[21:18] There we go.
[21:19] And then I don't really want to have the digest hex.
[21:23] Um,
[21:25] and I think we still need the dot two string on this
[21:30] if I remember correctly.
[21:31] Let's see.
[21:35] Let's see what happens
[21:38] if we do hex.
[21:40] Just hex by encoding hex, reduce.
[21:46] Yeah, that's fair, I guess.
[21:51] We're gonna actually publish a new version of this.
[22:02] Okay, so digest.
[22:06] This block, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[22:09] Buffer, new UNAID array, data view.
[22:13] And then it's returning the buffer, that's great.
[22:18] And then we can have, encoding can be hex.
[22:29] Let's see.
[22:33] (keyboard clicking)
[22:37] Okay, did this have a JS config before I got here?
[22:39] Git blame JS config.
[22:45] No, it did not.
[22:47] Okay, that was my edition.
[22:48] Okay, so if encoding is equal to hex,
[22:54] this is kind of interesting here
[22:56] because this is suggesting that a UNAID array
[22:59] you can use reduce on.
[23:01] Which I was not aware you could do that.
[23:04] I mean, I just get so confused
[23:06] because the array methods are just not consistent
[23:09] between the different types of typed arrays
[23:11] and all that stuff.
[23:12] Okay, so that's good.
[23:14] I'm going to say,
[23:21] let's see, we got package.json, bump.
[23:26] So this now needs to be bump.
[23:31] (keyboard clicking)
[23:34] Let's see.
[23:36] Yeah, bump there.
[23:40] We're not actually going to use that doc.
[23:47] Let me just make sure.
[23:51] Yeah, rm-rf docs.
[24:00] Let's see, do we have the js.config?
[24:02] No, that's not here either, good.
[24:03] All right, and then index.
[24:08] I actually think,
[24:13] 'cause this one doesn't have anything else
[24:15] that it depends on,
[24:16] so I'm going to get rid of the pre-published script too.
[24:19] I'm going to update the package
[24:22] so that main is ripe-md-160.
[24:27] (keyboard clicking)
[24:30] Okay, we're going to get rid of index.
[24:35] And then this does not depend on anything else,
[24:41] right, no require.
[24:43] (keyboard clicking)
[24:55] Exports.
[24:57] So I actually want ripe-md,
[25:03] where's that defined?
[25:04] Oh, class, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[25:09] Okay.
[25:14] Let's see what we can do here.
[25:23] var ripe-md-160.
[25:26] See if we can somehow fix that.
[25:31] All right, I'm going to go back
[25:35] to the thing we were just working on,
[25:37] the HDKey.
[25:39] Lib HDKey, and see what was,
[25:43] let me try to get this thing here.
[25:52] I'm going to use the same,
[25:53] I'll use the same for all of these.
[25:55] Let's see, ripe-md.
[25:58] Let me actually pull this all over
[26:01] before I make any of the changes.
[26:03] And then this one's just going to have a create
[26:05] with a digest and a couple of things.
[26:07] Okay.
[26:13] So we don't need this.
[26:21] And we don't need this.
[26:23] But we can just do HDKey ripe-md-160.
[26:31] Ripe-md-160.
[26:42] Okay.
[26:51] ripe-md-160.create.
[26:53] And then we need to have our create function defined.
[26:57] I've already got one here that has a create.
[27:00] Let's just take the same thing.
[27:06] Do it here.
[27:08] Type there.
[27:18] Okay, so.
[27:20] Ripe-create.
[27:22] Ripe-create.
[27:31] And then it returns.
[27:35] Ripe-md-160.
[27:40] (typing)
[27:42] And then let me go check,
[27:51] how do we handle that over here?
[27:53] So just like this.
[27:56] (typing)
[28:09] Okay, where's this one at?
[28:10] HDKey, ignore, all right.
[28:15] Okay, so then this, the ripe-md-create,
[28:18] it's a ripe-md-160 type.
[28:22] Let me see.
[28:24] Type of.
[28:27] Okay, so this will be ripe-md-160.
[28:31] And then what it's going to have is ripe-update
[28:37] and ripe-digest, I believe.
[28:39] (typing)
[28:43] Okay.
[28:51] Let's see, updates.
[28:58] Interesting.
[29:07] (typing)
[29:10] So this will be type.
[29:14] Ripe-updates.
[29:20] And then I will, since this one's so small,
[29:30] I think I'll just put everything up top here.
[29:32] (typing)
[29:37] All right, and this one is just going to take you
[29:40] an 8-array, and it's going to return itself.
[29:45] And then we'll have ripe-digest.
[29:52] And that will take a string.
[30:02] (typing)
[30:04] A string, encoding, and then it will return.
[30:09] Actually, I kind of want to just have it
[30:14] do nothing more than, eh, whatever.
[30:28] (typing)
[30:30] Let's see, where was digest?
[30:35] Let's see here.
[30:36] (typing)
[30:39], okay.
[31:08] There we go, are those the only things
[31:10] that are at that level?
[31:11] Okay, so here's a class.
[31:16] It's got a constructor.
[31:17] It's got an update.
[31:18] It's got a digest.
[31:22] That's it, that's the whole thing.
[31:25] Okie-dokie day.
[31:36] (typing)
[31:38] I'm tempted just to say
[31:51] get rid of the encoding.
[31:57] Just have it be UN8-array, then the types are simpler.
[32:06] Then it's not sometimes returning a UN8-array,
[32:08] sometimes returning a string.
[32:09] So.
[32:17] (typing)
[32:21], okay.
[32:26] So no parameters and just returns.
[32:51] UN8-array, that's it.
[32:53] (sighs)
[32:58] Does not handle streaming operations.
[33:20] Type script type.
[33:21] App ports.
[33:22] Removes.
[33:25] No string support.
[33:34] Use text.
[33:50] Encoder to turn.
[33:52] Encode strings to UN8-array.
[34:13] (typing)
[34:15] Let's make sure that nothing actually depends on this yet,
[34:23] but I think this is pretty fair to do.
[34:28] Buff.
[34:30] Ah, there we go.
[34:41] (typing)
[34:43] What hex equals.
[34:46] (typing)
[34:51] Ah, what did I do wrong?
[34:56] All right, there's buffer.
[35:20] (typing)
[35:23] There's function.
[35:25] There we go, okay.
[35:32] And then, so let's go ahead and try this out then.
[35:42] (typing)
[35:47] (soft music)
[35:50] I'm just gonna go.
[35:56] Go back into this project.
[36:00] Dash tools.
[36:02] Node.
[36:12] (typing)
[36:14] There we are.
[36:21] Let's see if I can just copy and paste some of this stuff.
[36:25] (typing)
[36:27] (soft music)
[36:30] Do this.
[36:54] Buff is not defined.
[36:55] Oh, whoops.
[36:56] (soft music)
[36:59] What?
[37:00] Oh, texty encoder, great.
[37:12] Good old trusty texty encoder.
[37:14] Okay, let's just go ahead and test and see what we get here.
[37:19] Ah, buff is not defined, blah, blah, blah, blah, hold on.
[37:22] (typing)
[37:25] (soft music)
[37:28] All right.
[37:37] Hash.digest.
[37:42] UN8 array, here we go, this is what I wanted.
[37:49] (typing)
[37:52] (soft music)
[37:55] 139 and 200.
[38:08] (typing)
[38:11] (soft music)
[38:13] Okay, so, what?
[38:28] No, that did not work.
[38:29] That's, I am so confused.
[38:31] How did that work in the one context at all then?
[38:34] (soft music)
[38:37] (typing)
[38:39] Oh.
[38:45] Ah.
[38:48] Okay.
[38:52] Data.
[38:54] Ripe MD 160.
[39:00] Let's change the names of these things.

[42:40] (soft music)
[42:42] (typing)
[42:45] (soft music)
[42:47] (typing)
[42:49] Okay, so now that's...
[42:52] We should be able to just copy paste this, I think,
[42:55] and try again.
[42:56] I'm gonna just try like this.
[42:59] (soft music)
[43:02] (typing)
[43:04] (soft music)

[45:19] Okay, what we need to do,
[45:20] get out of here, get back in here.
[45:23] Let ripeMD
[45:26] (soft music)
[45:29] (typing)
[45:30] locally here.
[45:32] It would be nice if it understood the current module,
[45:37] where it was coming from.
[45:39] (soft music)
[45:41] Okay, is this correct?
[45:43] This is correct.
[45:44] All right, sweet.
[45:46] So, confirmed that it's not too broken.
[45:50] Test.html.

[46:18] (soft music)
[46:21] (typing)
[46:23] (soft music)
[46:25] (typing)
[46:27] Almost want a little to hex function.
[46:30] Could we build that in?
[46:31] Yeah, we could put it in.
[46:35] Hold on, I'm just gonna put it in here.
[46:36] I'm gonna be a sucker.
[46:38] (soft music)
[46:40] (typing)
[46:42] (soft music)
[46:45] (typing)
[46:47] (soft music)
[46:49] (typing)
[46:51] All right.
[46:52] So, ripeMD dot
[46:55] (soft music)
[46:57] 160 dot.
[46:58] (soft music)
[47:01] All right, so let's just go ahead
[47:02] and put a ripeMD dot to hex here.
[47:04] (soft music)
[47:07] (typing)
[47:09] (soft music)

[47:55] All right.
[47:56] There we go.
[47:57] That's that.
[47:58] (typing)
[47:59] Let's go ahead and open up that real quick
[48:01] and see.
[48:03] Whoops.
[48:04] (soft music)
[48:07] (typing)
[48:09] All right.
[48:10] When we check the console,
[48:11] (soft music)
[48:13] UTF-8 encoder is not defined.
[48:16] All right.
[48:17] That would kind of make sense.
[48:17] (soft music)
[48:20] (typing)
[48:23] RIPE MD-160 UTF-8 encoder.
[48:27] Get rid of it.
[48:29] (soft music)
[48:31] (typing)
[48:33] (soft music)
[48:36] (typing)
[48:38] (soft music)
[48:40] (typing)
[48:42] (soft music)
[48:44] No UF-8 array.
[48:46] And then this was 5250.
[48:50] That's what it was, right?
[48:51] (soft music)
[48:54] (typing)
[48:56] (soft music)
[48:58] (typing)
[49:00] (soft music)

[49:15] Cannot access hash before initializing on 14.
[49:18] (soft music)
[49:20] (typing)
[49:22] All right.
[49:24] (soft music)
[49:27] (typing)
[49:29] (soft music)
[49:31] Okay, cool.
[49:32] So that test passes.
[49:34] And do we have another test here?
[49:35] (soft music)
[49:38] (typing)
[49:40] (soft music)
[49:43] Oh, nice.
[49:45] Very simple.
[49:46] Okay.
[49:47] Update input.
[49:48] (soft music)
[49:51] (typing)
[49:53] (soft music)
[49:54] Wait, what?
[49:55] (soft music)
[49:57] No.
[49:58] Why?

[50:18] (typing)
[50:20] (soft music)
[50:22] (typing)
[50:24] (soft music)
[50:27] Not equal to.
[50:29] (typing)
[50:31] (soft music)
[50:33] (typing)
[50:34] Throw new error.
[50:36] (typing)
[50:39] (soft music)
[50:41] Let's see.
[50:41] (typing)
[50:43] Let digest equals.
[50:46] (typing)
[50:48] (soft music)
[50:49] If let data.
[50:52] (soft music)
[50:55] (typing)
[50:56] If string equals type of data.
[51:00] (typing)
[51:03] Then data equals new text encoder dot encode.
[51:08] (typing)
[51:13] (soft music)
[51:15] Input, whoops.
[51:17] Input.
[51:18] Else, and data equals input.
[51:26] (soft music)
[51:28] (typing)
[51:30] Digest.

[51:58] (soft music)
[52:00] Okay, so if hex is not equal to
[52:04] right from D 160, throw error.
[52:09] (typing)
[52:11] (soft music)
[52:13] (typing)
[52:15] (soft music)
[52:17] Let's see, what is this?

[53:09] (soft music)
[53:11] (typing)
[53:13] (soft music)
[53:16] (typing)
[53:17] All right, and then
[53:18] assert strict equal,
[53:21] same thing.
[53:24] (soft music)
[53:26] (typing)
[53:28] (soft music)
[53:31] (typing)
[53:33] (soft music)

[53:50] (typing)
[53:52] (soft music)
[53:55] (typing)
[53:56] Let result equals,
[53:58] let's see, FN.
[54:02] (soft music)
[54:04] (typing)
[54:07] (soft music)
[54:08] Let's put a green check here.
[54:10] (soft music)
[54:13] There.

[54:58] Two hex digest.
[55:01] (typing)
[55:03] (soft music)
[55:05] (typing)
[55:07] (soft music)
[55:09] And then what?
[55:10] (typing)
[55:12] (soft music)
[55:14] Then,
[55:15] function,
[55:18] assert.
[55:19] (typing)
[55:21] (soft music)

[56:40] (soft music)
[56:43] (typing)
[56:45] (soft music)
[56:47] (typing)
[56:50] There we go.
[56:51] If actual is equal to expected,
[56:52] then just return.
[56:53] And then the default behavior is to throw the error.
[56:57] And then here,
[57:00] we got the vector.
[57:02] Great.
[57:03] (typing)
[57:04] And then we can just do strict equal here as well.
[57:07] Well, not quite,
[57:09] because we also need to do
[57:12] the let input equals new text encoder
[57:19] dot encode.
[57:23] (typing)
[57:25] (soft music)
[57:28] 42.
[57:32] Actually again,
[57:33] we don't need that.
[57:34] We can just do let data equals an eight array.
[57:38] 52, 50.
[57:43] (soft music)
[57:45] (typing)
[57:48] (soft music)

[57:54] (soft music)
[57:56] (typing)
[57:58] (soft music)
[58:01] (typing)
[58:02] All right.
[58:03] And then expected should be this one actually.
[58:05] There we go.
[58:09] (soft music)
[58:11] (typing)
[58:13] (soft music)
[58:15] (typing)
[58:17] (soft music)

[74:37] Preserve this repo, allow merge.
[74:42] (soft music)
[74:44] And then do we have branch protection?
[74:52] We don't have branch protection.
[74:53] Let's go ahead and add that.
[74:54] Require pull request.
[74:57] Require resolution, sign commits, linear history.
[75:05] Do not allow bypassing.
[75:07] Use security key.
[75:11] Oh, USB security key.
[75:13] Where are you at?

[75:19] (keys jangling)
[75:22] (keys jangling)
[75:24] There we go.
[75:24] Cool.
[75:28] (soft music)
[75:31] (keys jangling)
[75:35] V2.
[75:43] I do want to take a look at this real quick.
[75:46] So where was...
[75:48] (keys jangling)
[75:51] 2.2.
[76:04] Nope, let's try again.
[76:07] 2.2.
[76:16] Okay, so get reset hard.
[76:19] Get tag.
[76:22] V2.2.2.
[76:24] Get rebase main.
[76:37] Get log.
[76:40] Okay, that's it.
[76:44] Get reset hard.
[76:46] That's fine.
[76:47] Get, get...
[76:48] (soft music)
[76:51] (keys jangling)
[76:53] (soft music)
[76:56] (keys jangling)
[76:58] (soft music)
[77:01] (keys jangling)
[77:04] (soft music)
[77:07] (keys jangling)
[77:10] (soft music)
[77:12] (keys jangling)
[77:15] Bum, bum, bum.
[77:41] (soft music)
[77:43] All right, I'm very confused as to what just happened there.
[77:46] Thank goodness I saw that the mic cut out,
[77:50] but why in the world did the mic just stop working?
[77:53] How long has...
[77:56] Hey, quick question for y'all, if you wouldn't mind.
[78:00] Was I speaking and then the mic cut out
[78:03] for more than 30 seconds?
[78:05] If you could let me know, I'd be greatly appreciated.
[78:09] You can hear me?
[78:10] Can you hear me?
[78:11] Yeah, you should be able to hear me.
[78:15] Yeah, I don't know what is going on with this mic setup,
[78:18] but I just had to turn it off and turn it back on again.
[78:23] I wonder if it had to do with plugging in the USB key.
[78:26] Security key.
[78:27] How y'all doing?
[78:28] I'm AJ.
[78:30] Who are you?
[78:30] What brings you here?
[78:32] What would you like to learn about today?
[78:34] Okay, so git checkout bump v3.
[78:39] Git push, git checkout main,
[78:44] git rebase v3.
[78:46] What?
[78:47] Oh, bump v3.
[78:50] Git push.
[78:53] All right.
[78:57] (soft music)
[79:00] Okay.
[79:10] So now I'm finally about to publish this
[79:13] with just a couple of changes there.
[79:15] So now we won't have this ambiguous type issue.
[79:23] (soft music)
[79:25] And there was something else I think had text encoder in it
[79:39] that I could...
[79:40] Let's see, ripmd and base 68 check this one.
[79:45] Does this one have text encoder?
[79:47] I hope not.
[79:48] No.
[79:49] Base 58 check.js.
[79:53] And where do we go here?
[79:56] Base 58 check.
[80:02] Okay, exports.
[80:08] We're gonna have to rearrange that just a touch.
[80:13] So we're gonna bring ripmd 160 into this
[80:19] and then a couple of extra functions
[80:20] and we're gonna call it dash keys.
[80:22] (soft music)
[80:24] Okay, that one's good.
[80:39] All right.
[80:44] So let's do npm install, save,
[80:47] add dash incubator ripmd at three.
[80:50] (soft music)
[80:53] Oh, I didn't publish.
[80:55] Let me go back to the ripmd bit npm.
[81:00] So get status here, npm publish.
[81:05] Well, let's get push tags, push npm publish.
[81:10] (soft music)
[81:15] (soft music continues)
[81:18] What do y'all think about the music today?
[81:26] (soft music continues)
[81:43] I need something that notifies me
[81:45] when a mic source is not receiving any sound at all.
[81:50] When there's not even noise.
[81:52] (soft music)
[81:54] (soft music continues)
[81:57] (soft music continues)
[82:01] (soft music continues)
[82:05] (keyboard clicking)
[82:08] (soft music)
[82:31] Okay, so that's good.
[82:35] Let's go back to the install here.
[82:38] All right.
[82:42] (soft music)
[83:00] Okay, and just one second.
[83:02] (soft music continues)
[83:06] Oh, whoops.
[83:13] (soft music continues)
[83:16] Ooh, I might need to join in on a call.
[83:27] (soft music continues)
[83:30] Ah, crap.
[83:34] Ooh.
[83:40] Okay, let's see here.
[83:45] So this one, that will become dash keys.
[83:47] This is the one that we need to figure out.
[83:49] Okay, good that that is now using the default export.
[83:56] That's excellent.
[83:58] Um, secp256k1.
[84:02] So I don't think that we actually have a private key verify.
[84:07] If, so the way to verify a private key
[84:10] is simply to create a public key.
[84:14] So it's kind of,
[84:17] it's interesting that they have this method separate
[84:20] because really you just call it once.
[84:21] If you can create a private, a public key,
[84:23] then it's a private key.
[84:24] If you can't create a public key.
[84:26] (soft music continues)
[84:29] What is going on?
[84:42] Why did my audio go out?
[84:44] Oh man.
[84:54] (sighs)
[84:56] I don't understand.
[84:59] Okay, I have a second idea.
[85:12] Hold on.
[85:14] Let me, let me see if I can fix the audio here.
[85:19] (soft music continues)
[85:22] All right, so we're going to plug in the audio.
[85:29] Oops.
[85:30] No, this is not going to fix it.
[85:35] Dang it.
[85:36] I'm just going to have to keep my eye on it for right now.
[85:40] And then maybe, I don't know.
[85:43] I don't know what I'm going to do.
[85:44] This is really frustrating.
[85:46] I can't have the audio just going out at random.
[85:48] (sighs)
[85:50] Well, oh, hey Ryan, how's it going?
[85:57] So the mic has gone out twice now.
[85:59] When it was robotic,
[86:03] it was probably because there was an echo.
[86:06] I had two copies of the mic going.
[86:08] Now, I basically, I put a buffer,
[86:16] an audio buffer device that,
[86:21] my thought was this, my thought was,
[86:23] well, I've got the Yeti mic and I've got the H1N mic.
[86:26] And when I switch between the two, OBS tends to get upset.
[86:30] So I thought, okay, I'll create a loopback device
[86:35] that contains both mics
[86:36] and I'll just have OBS listen to the one mic.
[86:40] And that way,
[86:46] it won't matter which one's plugged in
[86:47] because the loopback device will handle selecting
[86:50] which one's plugged in.
[86:52] And then OBS will just always have one source
[86:54] that's always there because it's a virtualized source.
[86:57] So whether it's plugged in or unplugged,
[86:59] the loopback device is 100% of the time,
[87:02] it's always present.
[87:03] But unfortunately, something is going wrong
[87:11] and it is getting disconnected.
[87:14] Okay.
[87:16] Anyway, good to see you.
[87:17] How you doing?
[87:18] I just, this was bugging me.
[87:21] And so I just, I needed to continue on with it,
[87:26] even though I've got some other stuff I need to do.
[87:28] I just want to get to the point
[87:30] where this has all the dash tools
[87:34] and then I'm going to put pause on it.
[87:36] So this, okay.
[87:41] (upbeat music)
[87:44] Okay, dash TX is probably what I need here.
[87:52] Where did that one go?
[87:55] Examples.
[87:56] Okay.
[88:03] (upbeat music)
[88:05] (tapping)
[88:08] (upbeat music)
[88:10] (tapping)
[88:12] (upbeat music)
[88:39] To do, this will fold into dash keys.
[88:44] Okay.
[89:02] (upbeat music)
[89:04] Okay, and we should be able to get rid of that one.
[89:28] Dash TX, dash TX, and then sec P.
[89:33] Sign with a private key, get public key.
[89:41] Just going to keep my eye on this sucker.
[89:52] I might file a bug report with loopback.
[89:57] (upbeat music)
[90:00] Because really, if something goes wrong with the mic,
[90:02] so I have this happen all the time, actually.
[90:04] And maybe it's the cable,
[90:06] maybe it's something with the USB, I don't know.
[90:09] But I have this happen all the time
[90:10] where the mic just disconnects for a minute.
[90:12] Well, for a second, it just disconnects for a second.
[90:16] And I've noticed it in some of the clip videos
[90:19] where sometimes there'll just be a little glitch.
[90:23] And I don't know what's causing that,
[90:27] but it does make me want to maybe get the mic.
[90:32] I've only got so many ports that things can go through.
[90:38] And I gotta have a whole bunch of stuff connected.
[90:42] I don't know.
[90:43] I'm thinking about, once I get some more money,
[90:46] maybe getting a Mac studio that just stays here
[90:48] and then rewiring things so that they're not wired
[90:53] in order to be easy to connect and disconnect and reach,
[90:57] but wired as a permanent setup
[90:58] with just one USB-C hub that comes around the front.
[91:02] I gotta get something figured out.
[91:05] Yeah.
[91:09] Audio is doing something weird.
[91:12] But I don't know.
[91:18] I just need to spend,
[91:20] instead of spending 20 or $30 on a USB hub,
[91:23] I need to just drop $500 on a USB hub.
[91:27] That's not true either because I actually bought,
[91:29] before I got the Thunderbolt hub that I have,
[91:33] I bought about four of them to test them.
[91:36] And they're ridiculously expensive.
[91:38] They're in the realm of two to $300 each.
[91:43] And I bought four of them, tested them all,
[91:46] and I kept the one that seemed to work the best.
[91:49] But USB and Thunderbolt and all that
[91:52] just become so complicated.
[91:53] They're just not reliable.
[91:55] I don't know.
[91:57] I don't know what to do about it.
[92:03] Anyway.
[92:05] Let me just...
[92:06] Okay, it's not the cable loose here.
[92:10] I'm jiggling the cable.
[92:11] That's fine.
[92:12] Let me just knock into these.
[92:14] That's fine.
[92:15] Knock these.
[92:16] That's fine.
[92:19] Put something in the USB over here.
[92:21] Okay, that's still fine.
[92:25] Unplug it.
[92:26] That's fine.
[92:28] I don't know.
[92:28] I don't know what causes it.
[92:30] But I gotta get this taken care of.
[92:33] I need a more permanent solution.
[92:34] Okay, so here we are.
[92:38] Sec-P.
[92:40] What we need is...
[92:43] (typing)
[92:45] Oops.
[92:50] Value is private.
[92:53] And then also, what was that?
[92:55] Git public extended key.
[92:59] Oh, the encoder.
[93:00] I actually don't think the encode...
[93:02] I'm gonna put the original back here for a second
[93:11] 'cause I know how to do that one.
[93:12] That's not a question mark for us.
[93:15] So I'm just gonna put that one back for a second.
[93:20] It's gonna be so nice when this is finally done,
[93:25] done, done, done, done.
[93:26] (typing)
[93:31] (soft music)
[93:34] Okay, set private key.
[93:46] That's not what I wanted.
[93:47] Dang it.
[93:54] There we go.
[93:59] (soft music)
[94:01] (typing)
[94:03] (soft music)
[94:06] (typing)
[94:08] Okay, so public key.
[94:36] (soft music)
[94:38] Create value true.
[94:39] There we go.
[94:48] All right, so that one's simple enough.
[94:55] Wait, how do we get just the public key?
[95:04] Let me go back to Noblecrypto here for a second.
[95:07] Typed array.
[95:23] Okay, public key create.
[95:29] No, this is the other one.
[95:33] I need the Noblecrypto one.
[95:34] (soft music)
[95:37] Get public key.
[95:45] Oh, the public key is just the public key, duh.
[96:00] (soft music)
[96:02] Do we have any way to verify a public key?
[96:10] Utilities.
[96:18] Hash to private key, random bytes.
[96:28] Bytes to hex, hex to bytes.
[96:30] SHA-256.
[96:32] Tag hash, pre-compute.
[96:36] (soft music)
[96:39] Hmm.
[96:57] (soft music)
[97:25] Okay, so we just don't assert this.
[97:29] Public key verify.
[97:31] Hmm.
[97:39] Public key.
[97:51] (soft music)
[97:53] Can we...
[98:02] Return point dots.
[98:11] Get public key from signature.
[98:17] (soft music)
[98:19] (soft music)
[98:22], all right.
[98:52] (soft music)
[98:54] From compressed hex.
[98:56] What?
[98:58] Bytes you an eight array.
[99:07] Okay, sure.
[99:14] (soft music)
[99:16] Okay, from hex.
[99:40] Interesting, not documented, but it is there.
[99:44] (soft music)
[99:47] All right, so where, wait, where is from hex used?
[99:56] (soft music)
[99:59] So is this not a signature?
[100:07.64] And then we have, what's class sec?
[100:13.96] No.
[100:14.80] Okay, hold on.
[100:21.68] Require dash incubator slash sec p256k1.
[100:28.52] From hex dot point.
[100:40.64] (soft music)
[100:43.04] (soft music)
[100:45.44] Fair enough.
[100:57.00] (soft music)
[100:59.40] (soft music)
[101:01.80] Again, the rare exception.
[101:29.20] The only valid use for a try-catch.
[101:32.76] When you're actually parsing something.
[101:40.40] (soft music)
[101:42.80] Wait, did I just say...
[101:54.20] (soft music)
[101:56.60] (soft music)
[101:59.00] Okay, public key.
[102:06.28] (soft music)
[102:08.68] (soft music)
[102:11.08] Public key, convert public key, whatever.
[102:38.48] Okay, so point, can point go back two bytes?
[102:41.84] From compressed hex, from hex, from private key,
[102:47.28] from signature, two raw bytes.
[102:50.80] (soft music)
[103:06.64] Add, subtract, multiply.
[103:08.56] (soft music)
[103:10.96] (soft music)
[103:13.36] (soft music)
[103:15.76] (soft music)
[103:18.16] (soft music)
[103:20.56] (soft music)
[103:22.96] (soft music)
[103:25.44] (soft music)
[103:27.84] (soft music)
[103:43.04] (soft music)
[103:45.44] Okay, let's move this up here with the constants.
[104:01.20] (soft music)
[104:03.60] (soft music)
[104:06.00] (soft music)
[104:08.40] (soft music)
[104:37.60] Okay.
[104:38.44] So there's setting the public key.
[104:47.44] (soft music)
[104:54.22] (soft music)
[104:56.64] Okay.
[105:09.06] And then we get to the tweaking.
[105:16.46] Well, there's also the signing.
[105:22.30] (soft music)
[105:24.72] So Ryan, what do you think about the music today?
[105:32.50] (soft music)
[105:34.92] So message, key, ops.
[105:45.54] (soft music)
[105:48.20] Ops.
[105:49.04] I don't know if this is needed.
[105:57.20] I guess because it's a child key, you can do the signature.
[106:07.32] So you can just get a path and then do the signature.
[106:09.56] I think, I don't, let's see.
[106:13.20] It's signing with the private key.
[106:15.28] I think we can just drop this.
[106:17.00] The sign and verify.
[106:18.78] I think they, yeah, I think they just need to be dropped.
[106:21.58] I'm gonna leave it in here for now, but to do, drop this.
[106:27.54] (soft music)
[106:31.04] (soft music)
[106:33.46] 'Cause we're just dealing with raw bytes, so.
[106:54.48] (soft music)
[106:57.82] (soft music)
[107:00.24] Signature, hash, public key.
[107:10.22] I'm gonna go check and see how this is used in dash TX.
[107:17.46] I don't, sign.
[107:19.44] (soft music)
[107:21.86] (soft music)
[107:24.28] (soft music)
[107:26.70] (soft music)
[107:29.12] (soft music)
[107:31.54] (soft music)
[107:33.96] (soft music)
[107:36.38] (soft music)
[107:38.80] (soft music)
[107:41.22] (soft music)
[107:58.84] (soft music)
[108:01.26] All right, and then what are the,
[108:14.94] probably something, do we have a verify in here?
[108:17.44] (soft music)
[108:19.86] I don't think verify needs the canonical thing.
[108:25.82] What is vops?
[108:28.06] (soft music)
[108:30.48] Return false.
[108:44.88] Hash high S.
[108:46.30] Canonical.
[108:51.16] (soft music)
[108:53.58] (soft music)
[108:56.00] Verify.
[109:03.32] Ops.
[109:10.98] Okay, vops strict is true, I think.
[109:22.30] Okay, yeah, so strict is true.
[109:24.62] So we would just have,
[109:26.10] verify, ops, strict is true.
[109:33.26] Canonical.
[109:36.50] (soft music)
[109:40.26] (soft music)
[109:42.68] Okay, and then we got to get that tweak thing.
[110:01.02] That's the most important bit.
[110:02.56] No pun intended.
[110:06.42] (groans)
[110:08.50] All right.
[110:11.74] Where was that tweaker?
[110:16.98] (soft music)
[110:20.76] (soft music)
[110:23.18] All right, TweakyTills private ad.
[110:44.76] (soft music)
[110:47.18] (soft music)
[110:49.60] Okay, secp, is that just what this is imported as at the top?
[111:03.54] (soft music)
[111:05.96] (soft music)
[111:08.38] Okay.
[111:20.64] (soft music)
[111:26.40] (soft music)
[111:28.82] Okay.
[111:43.46] (soft music)
[111:45.88] Secp.
[111:55.38] (soft music)
[111:57.80] 256k1.
[112:00.70] Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot.
[112:07.76] And then there's something here for normalize, normal.
[112:15.68] Crap, where'd normal come from?
[112:24.94] (soft music)
[112:27.36] (soft music)
[112:29.78] (soft music)
[112:32.20] (soft music)
[112:34.62] Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot.
[112:39.62] (soft music)
[112:44.08] (soft music)
[112:58.42] (soft music)
[113:03.02] (soft music)
[113:05.44] All right, and then we get rid of comment syntax.
[113:27.80] Oop.
[113:32.84] (soft music)
[113:35.24] (soft music)
[113:37.66] Okay.
[113:47.68] (soft music)
[114:01.82] Comment param.
[114:03.00] It's interesting, it calls hex UNArray.
[114:06.78] It's probably something from olden times.
[114:11.78] Tweak.
[114:17.34] (soft music)
[114:19.76] Okay.
[114:28.22] (soft music)
[114:30.86] (soft music)
[114:33.28] Oh, I don't think we actually need
[114:36.50] to use that point scaler, do we?
[114:38.10] No, we don't, okay.
[114:44.08] Well, we do, that's the public key.
[114:47.74] Point multiply.
[114:53.84] Okay, we don't need to use this one.
[114:57.94] So definitely let's not have things
[115:00.54] we don't need.
[115:01.38] There we go.
[115:07.98] So, function.
[115:09.70] Retweet compressed, and this one is
[115:15.26] private key and tweak.
[115:19.22] And that returns UNArray.
[115:23.74] A new private key.
[115:30.30] A derivative.
[115:31.56] (soft music)
[115:33.98] (soft music)
[115:36.40] (soft music)
[115:38.82] (soft music)
[115:41.24] (soft music)
[115:43.66] (soft music)
[115:46.08] (soft music)
[115:48.50] Okay, point tweaked at infinity.
[116:14.90] (soft music)
[116:17.32] Okay, so let's look at the tweak.
[116:27.06] Tweak, utils.privateadd, pointaddscaler.
[116:35.28] (soft music)
[116:42.52] (soft music)
[116:44.94] All right.
[116:53.98] And those tweak utils are highly specific.
[116:59.26] So I think,
[117:00.58] I think they do need to go into the secpk256,
[117:07.20] whatever, I can't say that thing, secp256k1library.
[117:10.84] I think that they need to move there.
[117:12.50] So, todo, move to secp256k1.
[117:17.50] All right, where's the other tweaker?
[117:25.58] Compressed key.
[117:40.82] (soft music)
[117:43.24] Okay, that could be it.
[117:55.38] Getdiffpackage.json.
[118:03.48] Getdiffpackage.json.
[118:05.16] Okay.
[118:16.00] (soft music)
[118:25.10] (soft music)
[118:27.52] All right, so we've updated ripemd160.
[118:36.94] And let me actually make sure,
[118:39.18] the way that we're using that,
[118:40.66] create digest, yeah, that's right.
[118:46.54] Create, update, digest.
[118:48.18] Excellent.
[118:49.94] (soft music)
[118:52.36] Tweak utils was used before it was defined.
[119:00.78] Well, since it needs to be defined with,
[119:05.80] it's tied to the implementation of this thing.
[119:12.18] So I'm just gonna put it here for now.
[119:14.20] It's kind of ugly, but whatever.
[119:18.62] All right, moment of truth.
[119:20.54] This is whether I go cry or not.
[119:24.42] D'oh!
[119:30.02] Oh, wait.
[119:32.78] Huh.
[119:48.26] (soft music)
[119:50.32] Interesting.
[119:51.16] Okay, so it just wants the,
[120:16.26] (soft music)
[120:19.50] it doesn't want the ASN1 value,
[120:21.74] it wants the unencoded value.
[120:24.14] Let's see, where is,
[120:29.92] where's the other O2 in here?
[120:38.82] Should be about halfway through,
[120:40.02] we should see another O2, O2 and 20 right there.
[120:43.78] And so I'm imagining that this
[120:46.02] does not have any form of encoding on it.
[120:48.22] No, it doesn't.
[120:49.06] Okay, so the difference here,
[120:50.94] amazingly, amazingly, amazingly, that worked.
[120:55.94] (horn honking)
[121:01.64] It's working, it's working.
[121:06.36] Okay, so this is just a difference of encoding.
[121:12.26] That's all this is.
[121:13.92] I could probably change, let's see, sign,
[121:24.54] change the sign function.
[121:27.74] Let's,
[121:33.70] (soft music)
[121:36.12] had to toot one out.
[121:47.86] Okay, so,
[121:49.08] I wanna maintain the API, this kinda makes sense.
[121:58.12] So we're gonna take that buff,
[122:02.08] (soft music)
[122:03.96] and then,
[122:04.86] what we're gonna look at is buff
[122:13.20] the byte one, two, three, four, the fourth byte.
[122:19.26] XLIN,
[122:22.72] no, S, sorry.
[122:32.76] RLIN,
[122:34.40] ROFFSET,
[122:35.24] ROFFSET equals four.
[122:52.64] So if we start at zero, one, two, three,
[122:54.96] zero, one, two, three,
[123:01.60] if RLIN,
[123:03.68] so if 21 is equal to RLIN,
[123:08.28] ROFFSET equals
[123:10.44] five.
[123:15.48] Okay, so SOFFSET equals
[123:29.00] ROFFSET plus 32 plus four.
[123:33.80] (soft music)
[123:36.22] (soft music)
[123:38.64] (soft music)
[123:41.06] (soft music)
[123:43.48] (soft music)
[123:45.90] (soft music)
[123:48.32] (soft music)
[123:50.74] (soft music)
[123:53.16] Okay.
[124:19.96] (soft music)
[124:23.12] Let R equals BUFF.SLICE
[124:26.76] ROFFSET 32.
[124:31.90] SOFFSET 32.
[124:44.14] (soft music)
[124:46.56] (soft music)
[124:48.98] (soft music)
[124:51.40] (soft music)
[124:53.82] (soft music)
[124:56.24] (soft music)
[124:59.66] (soft music)
[125:02.08] (soft music)
[125:04.50] (soft music)
[125:06.92] (soft music)
[125:09.34] (soft music)
[125:11.76] All right.
[125:37.76] And then R,
[125:38.60] (soft music)
[125:41.02] R.SETS32.
[125:57.72] (soft music)
[126:04.14] (soft music)
[126:06.56] (soft music)
[126:24.26] Overwrite.
[126:29.52] (soft music)
[126:34.56] (soft music)
[126:36.18] Overwrites itself.
[126:37.56] So we've got a few wasted bytes here.
[126:44.48] No big deal.
[126:45.56] Actually, it could be a bigger deal than what it seems
[126:49.16] because of the underlying size, but whatever.
[126:53.20] R.SETR0.
[127:02.86] R.SETR0.
[127:03.70] (soft music)
[127:30.52] Eh, I should probably just return their SLICE.
[127:35.20] Okay.
[127:36.04] ASIN1SIGLETSIG=NEW_UN8_ARRAY(64), right?
[127:46.32] Trying to remember how many characters.
[127:59.68] These are 16 bytes each?
[128:02.10] Yes.
[128:02.94] So these are actually 16 bytes each.
[128:05.10] Or are they 32 bytes each?
[128:07.24] Let's take a look at some output here.
[128:09.82] Where did we have that, if anywhere?
[128:16.82] I forget.
[128:21.52] There are 256-bit keys of two parts.
[128:24.32] So the private key is 256 bits.
[128:26.76] So the signature is 256 bits.
[128:29.44] 256 bits is 32 bytes.
[128:32.36] Okay, SIG.
[128:34.18] There we go.
[128:35.60] SIG.SETR, SIG.SETR, RETURN SIG.
[128:40.04] So ASIN1SIG, ASIN1SIG,
[128:50.04] which we could also call that DIR if we wanted to.
[128:55.50] (soft music)
[128:57.92] Okay, so.
[129:04.70] Our offsets.
[129:21.08] (soft music)
[129:23.50] There we go.
[129:35.00] And then SOFFSET is ROFFSET+32+4,
[129:39.76] SOFFSET, SOFFSET, DIR, SOFFSET, SETSIG.
[129:45.66] (soft music)
[129:48.08] Okay, now let's run the test.
[130:12.18] (soft music)
[130:14.60] So now we have some other problem that's kind of similar.
[130:30.12] (soft music)
[130:32.54] Oh, duh.
[130:39.42] 32.
[130:41.84] (soft music)
[130:44.26] Okay, now this is 64.
[130:50.42] Sorry.
[130:51.66] 16 is 128.
[130:53.58] 32 is 256.
[130:57.46] 64 is 512.
[131:00.74] (soft music)
[131:03.16] Okay, what went wrong here?
[131:08.66] Something went wrong.
[131:09.70] Something went terribly, terribly wrong.
[131:11.70] Now it is 32,
[131:15.50] but I need to take 16 here
[131:20.22] and 16 here
[131:23.86] and 16 here
[131:28.66] and 16 here.
[131:32.58] Okay, I'm calculating in hex rather than in bytes.
[131:35.38] That's my problem.
[131:36.34] No?
[131:39.02] (sighs)
[131:41.00] All right, what happened?
[131:42.50] What happened?
[131:43.94] Subarray.
[131:44.82] Console.log
[131:52.18] RS, let's see.
[131:56.14] DIR,
[131:56.98] RS,
[131:59.50] ROFFSET,
[132:02.46] SOFFSET.
[132:03.94] What's going on?
[132:05.14] (soft music)
[132:07.56] ROFFSET.
[132:23.20] (soft music)
[132:25.62] All right, let's try this again.
[132:43.20] DIR with the DIR.
[132:47.88] R with the R.
[132:52.98] (keyboard clicking)
[132:55.12] S with the S.
[132:57.02] ROFFSET.
[133:02.76] SOFFSET.
[133:05.60] Okay, so what's going on here?
[133:17.00] There's the DIR.
[133:18.32] It's got 71 bytes.
[133:20.00] One, two, three, four.
[133:23.24] And so zero, one, two, three, four, five.
[133:27.20] This starts at five.
[133:28.88] So our OFFSET should be five.
[133:31.52] Oh, (sneezes)
[133:37.80] I was thinking 0x21, sorry.
[133:40.06] That's why we're off.
[133:45.00] This is not 0x21.
[133:47.48] I mean,
[133:48.32] there we go.
[133:51.08] (keyboard clicking)
[133:54.08] All right, so let's see what's happening here.
[133:57.70] So that's correct.
[134:02.94] But why has S got nothing in it?
[134:10.40] (dog barking)
[134:12.90] So there's 70 bytes.
[134:26.16] Why is this only 12 bytes?
[134:34.76] What am I doing wrong?
[134:36.36] What is going on?
[134:37.50] (keyboard clicking)
[134:40.50] Oh, ROFFSET.
[134:44.62] Because SUBARRAY is not like SUBSTRING.
[134:46.90] SUBARRAY is like SLICE, unlike DATAVIEW.
[134:50.88] (grunts)
[134:52.48] (keyboard clicking)
[134:55.48] (keyboard clicking)
[134:58.48] Okay, so let's go back to 64 then.
[135:19.48] Is it 64 or is it 32?
[135:23.32] Am I counting bytes in hex?
[135:25.44] What am I counting bytes in?
[135:26.92] All right, is this right?
[135:35.76] Wait, now I'm back to copying a bunch of zeros
[135:38.64] for no reason.
[135:39.48] (keyboard clicking)
[135:43.68] (dog barking)
[136:12.56] Okay, OFFSET plus 32.
[136:15.20] Wait, 32?
[136:28.48] What am I messing up here?
[136:41.88] All right, the bytes are so close.
[136:43.74] I'm off by one on both accounts,
[136:49.36] so I think what I'm running into here
[136:52.48] is ROFFSET by, well, hold on.
[136:58.72] 64 bytes.
[137:11.04] Okay, why am I off by two bytes?
[137:16.04] ROFFSET.
[137:40.44] Okay, let's just not have an ROFFSET.
[137:42.68] Let's just have an OFFSET.
[137:44.00] (keyboard clicking)
[137:47.00] (dog barking)
[137:49.50] (keyboard clicking)
[137:52.50] (keyboard clicking)
[138:19.62] Are there two extra encapsulation bytes?
[138:22.78] Where am I?
[138:24.78] Where's my thinking wrong here?
[138:26.42] Okay, here's the DIR.
[138:39.74] Here's the ROFFSET.
[138:49.26] (keyboard clicking)
[138:52.26] All right, and there's the S with its OFFSET.
[139:09.06] One failing.
[139:14.12] (keyboard clicking)
[139:17.12] Okay, I'm not quite sure what I changed there.
[139:28.64] I thought I was just making it better for logging,
[139:31.44] but apparently I changed something.
[139:32.96] Whatever, it's fine.
[139:34.50] (keyboard clicking)
[139:37.50] I might just nix this signing stuff
[139:48.86] because it's not super relevant.
[139:59.38] (keyboard clicking)
[140:02.38] Oh, this is probably supposed to throw an error.
[140:16.74] Let's see, 190.
[140:20.54] My guess is that this is an error that throws error
[140:23.74] when there's no private key and it's trying to sign.
[140:26.34] (keyboard clicking)
[140:29.34] No?
[140:31.30] (keyboard clicking)
[140:36.18] Okay, U8 to hex.
[140:47.20] Do we actually return anything there?
[140:52.66] We do.
[140:54.50] (keyboard clicking)
[140:57.50] HGKEYVERIFY.
[141:18.86] (keyboard clicking)
[141:21.86] (soft music)
[141:24.28] Oh, VERIFY, duh.
[141:38.90] (keyboard clicking)
[141:42.40] (soft music)
[141:44.82] Isn't this so weird?
[141:55.60] (keyboard clicking)
[142:00.30] CONSOLE.LOG.
[142:01.82] (keyboard clicking)
[142:11.26] TEST HDKEY CONSOLE.LOG.
[142:15.02] Oh, whoops.
[142:17.42] (keyboard clicking)
[142:20.42] Okay, this commit right here.
[142:27.84] (keyboard clicking)
[142:30.88] (soft music)
[142:33.30] HIT COMMIT.
[142:50.90] TEST REMOVE JUNK.
[142:54.24] I'm glad that the music's great today.
[142:57.32] (keyboard clicking)
[143:00.32] (soft music)
[143:02.74] All right, come on.
[143:16.20] We can do it.
[143:18.24] SIGNATURE HASH HDPUBLICKEYVERIFYOPS.
[143:24.24] (keyboard clicking)
[143:27.24] (soft music)
[143:29.66] Okay, what is missing?
[143:53.84] So one thing I know is wrong,
[143:57.44] is that we'd have to, so here we're decoding.
[144:02.44] And this kind of is specific to the SECP256K1 here,
[144:10.72] but there we're decoding,
[144:12.36] which means that here we have to ENCODE,
[144:14.52] which means that we have to say,
[144:18.10] we have to look at the byte,
[144:24.88] we have to say, if SIG0,
[144:26.80] let,
[144:31.76] when equals 64,
[144:40.36] if SIG0 is greater than hex 80,
[144:45.36] when plus equals one,
[144:49.00] (keyboard clicking)
[144:52.00] if SIG32,
[144:57.10] when plus one,
[145:01.42] let new UN8 array,
[145:03.64] when,
[145:10.56] (keyboard clicking)
[145:15.56] (soft music)
[145:17.98] enter one, two, three,
[145:25.26] is equal to, what was it?
[145:33.26] 30,
[145:38.04] 44,
[145:44.24] (keyboard clicking)
[145:45.98] 02,
[145:46.82] 0x,
[145:51.22] and then,
[145:53.06] (keyboard clicking)
[145:57.36] (soft music)
[146:01.78] Let's see.
[146:14.86] So if SIG,
[146:15.90] let index equals four,
[146:30.16] let offset equals four,
[146:32.68] dir dot set,
[146:41.38] and then r offset,
[146:45.28] let r equals SIG dot subarray,
[147:02.82] zero to 32,
[147:08.70] and then S is equal to subarray 32 to 64,
[147:13.70] offsets plus equals two,
[147:27.72] let's see, dir offset,
[147:37.00] (keyboard clicking)
[147:40.00] 32, dir offset equals 0x20.
[147:44.38] (keyboard clicking)
[147:49.84] Oh, dang it.
[148:03.66] What's going on?
[148:05.48] Oh, oh, spam, cancel.
[148:07.92] Okay.
[148:10.64] So if the offset is equal to three,
[148:13.26] (sighs)
[148:17.44] (keyboard clicking)
[148:22.84] (soft music)
[148:25.26] (keyboard clicking)
[148:28.26] All right.
[148:35.96] (keyboard clicking)
[148:38.96] (soft music)
[149:08.42] There's the zero byte.
[149:10.24] Okay.
[149:17.32] So let me try to get this straight again.
[149:19.46] So if it's less than eight, no.
[149:21.20] If it's less, oh, whoops.
[149:23.98] This is greater than or equal to here.
[149:25.94] All right.
[149:30.78] So if the signature,
[149:33.16] (keyboard clicking)
[149:36.16] is the high bit,
[149:41.06] if the high bit is low on the signature for the R value,
[149:44.62] then,
[149:50.00] then the size is 20 and there's no pad bit.
[149:57.90] But if the signature is high,
[150:01.16] then the size is, oh, sorry, that's actually 32.
[150:04.42] Then 33 plus pad.
[150:05.98] 'Cause I'm thinking in hex, not in decimal.
[150:08.62] Then we do the offset again.
[150:13.90] We store the R value.
[150:15.36] We increment and then repeat.
[150:17.82] So we say, okay, if the R value is 32,
[150:26.90] two.
[150:28.74] (keyboard clicking)
[150:31.74] Wow.
[150:55.48] (keyboard clicking)
[150:58.48] Talk about some code bloat.
[151:01.26] Okay.
[151:14.98] Then the offset.
[151:15.82] (keyboard clicking)
[151:20.26] (keyboard clicking)
[151:23.26] So S.
[151:26.64] (keyboard clicking)
[151:29.64] All right.
[151:49.40] Okay.
[151:50.24] I think there's, there's our Dura encoding.
[151:53.74] Offset is out of bounds.
[151:59.06] Let's see, offset is equal to one.
[152:13.96] There we go.
[152:14.80] (keyboard clicking)
[152:17.80] What did we do?
[152:22.00] We said this was 32, right?
[152:23.60] Yeah.
[152:24.44] And which line was that on?
[152:37.80] 373, 373.
[152:39.84] Let's see.
[152:41.68] (keyboard clicking)
[152:44.68] Console dot log.
[152:50.60] Offset.
[152:53.34] Let's see, length and offset.
[152:57.58] So this is our Dura.
[153:08.54] (keyboard clicking)
[153:11.54] 65 is our length.
[153:24.80] How can 38 be out of bounds?
[153:26.70] Oh, I see how.
[153:32.66] Because
[153:35.38] (keyboard clicking)
[153:38.38] the length does not start as a minimum of 64.
[153:44.10] The link starts as two bytes
[153:47.86] plus two bytes
[153:50.20] plus 32
[153:52.74] plus two
[153:54.78] plus 32.
[153:55.92] (keyboard clicking)
[153:58.92] (keyboard clicking)
[154:01.92] Okay.
[154:12.70] Console dot log.
[154:13.52] Missing expected rejection.
[154:18.24] (keyboard clicking)
[154:21.24] All right, let's try this out.
[154:33.68] It's probably exactly what it says it is.
[154:38.00] Signature dot length.
[154:41.08] So 99.
[154:44.36] Got it.
[154:46.08] (keyboard clicking)
[154:48.36] So verify.
[154:49.98] Oops.
[154:54.44] Where have we got the other length ones?
[155:07.48] 65 bytes.
[155:15.08] Verify.
[155:16.24] Well, let's see, what did I get?
[155:18.80] I must have accidentally deleted something here.
[155:21.80] Verify.
[155:22.94] Oh, okay.
[155:27.36] So that, it just does,
[155:29.96] it just has a different type of error.
[155:31.86] So it's testing.
[155:39.80] It's testing for something that is in the library below,
[155:42.40] which is not really a good thing to do.
[155:47.14] Signature must be
[156:03.12] 64 bytes.
[156:06.92] (keyboard clicking)
[156:09.92] Missing expected rejection.
[156:32.64] (keyboard clicking)
[156:35.64] But what's the rejection that it's missing?
[156:41.20] (keyboard clicking)
[156:50.48] Oh, okay, fine.
[157:00.76] (keyboard clicking)
[157:03.76] Message A, message B, 32 bytes, okay.
[157:14.72] I see what it's doing here.
[157:17.88] (keyboard clicking)
[157:20.92] (keyboard clicking)
[157:23.92] Come on!
[157:43.76] (keyboard clicking)
[157:46.76] (keyboard clicking)
[157:49.76] What is going on here?
[158:07.74] (keyboard clicking)
[158:10.74] (keyboard clicking)
[158:13.74] Am I mistaken?
[158:27.10] 32, 32.
[158:31.90] (keyboard clicking)
[158:40.42] All right, what did I do wrong?
[158:41.92] Oh, hash.
[158:44.16] Doi.
[158:46.14] All right, cool.
[158:48.54] (groans)
[158:52.44] ♪ Do what we must ♪
[158:53.94] ♪ Because we can ♪ - Because we can.
[158:57.14] (groans)
[158:59.34] All right.
[159:00.18] I'm gonna save cleanup for another time.
[159:03.72] I'm just gonna, um...
[159:07.50] ♪ This was a triumph ♪
[159:10.50] Making a note here, huge success.
[159:15.22] All right, that's it.
[159:18.98] There's cleanup to do, but now this is off my brain.
[159:25.62] Now I can focus on other things
[159:28.30] because the itchy part has been itched.
[159:30.50] And now I have other things that I need to do,
[159:33.74] so I'm gonna go do other things.
[159:35.34] (keyboard clicking)
[159:38.34] Oh, so annoying.
[159:43.26] (groans)
[159:52.34] But hey, this is exciting.
[159:58.22] I mean, this is a huge success.
[160:02.64] (keyboard clicking)
[160:05.64] Let's see.
[160:17.68] Is there anything else we'd need to do here?
[160:21.36] Base 58 check.
[160:25.36] I'm gonna roll up base 58 check and ripe MD.
[160:29.40] Whoops, 160, not 150.
[160:32.16] I'm gonna roll that up into dash keys.
[160:34.92] So I think that I will just,
[160:38.60] I just need to concatenate them and republish it.
[160:40.92] So I'll do that another time,
[160:42.12] but I'm going to roll up a base 58 check
[160:45.88] and ripe MD into dash keys
[160:48.60] before I go the rest of the way with this.
[160:51.68] Because then it'll just be the one dependency
[161:00.20] and it will be done.
[161:01.80] (keyboard clicking)
[161:04.80] But as is,
[161:07.44] this is pretty sweet.
[161:14.80] (keyboard clicking)
[161:19.60] So much for four to six hours.
[161:30.56] (keyboard clicking)
[161:31.68] But hey, 12 hours, not bad.
[161:33.80] Or I guess it's more like 16.
[161:36.16] I don't know.
[161:37.00] (laughs)
[161:39.08] But it's done.
[161:41.56] It is glorious.
[161:44.64] (keyboard clicking)
[161:48.68] Oh wait.
[161:55.48] (keyboard clicking)
[161:58.48] Replace.
[162:04.80] Replace secp 256 K one with
[162:12.84] at noble secp 256 K one.
[162:19.00] (keyboard clicking)
[162:24.28] (keyboard clicking)
[162:27.28] (keyboard clicking)
[162:30.28] (keyboard clicking)
[162:33.28] All right.
[162:58.24] So we removed safe buffer in favor of nodes buffer.
[163:01.64] We added types.
[163:02.52] We went from Bartlett.
[163:03.68] We replaced node buffer with you an eight array.
[163:05.48] We updated tests.
[163:06.68] We went async.
[163:09.08] Then we did an async all the tests.
[163:13.80] (keyboard clicking)
[163:16.80] (keyboard clicking)
[163:19.80] So this could get reworded.
[163:30.60] (keyboard clicking)
[163:33.60] (soft music)
[163:36.02] (keyboard clicking)
[163:42.96] (soft music)
[164:03.48] Updates.
[164:04.56] Right from D 160.
[164:08.20] (soft music)
[164:10.62] Move test junk.
[164:23.56] (soft music)
[164:32.44] All right.
[164:33.28] What's up?
[164:34.10] (soft music)
[164:36.52] Cherry comments, HD two, HD backup, HD JS, package lock.
[164:43.36] What do we have here in the to-do file?
[164:54.20] Nothing.
[164:55.52] To-do.
[164:56.36] (soft music)
[165:02.16] Types has got nothing in it.
[165:04.28] Right?
[165:05.12] What?
[165:07.64] Assertion.
[165:08.72] Serialize.
[165:09.56] Oh, right.
[165:12.00] Remove that.
[165:14.48] Okay.
[165:15.30] So what was it saying?
[165:17.12] (soft music)
[165:31.08] Okay, what was the problem?
[165:32.34] (soft music)
[165:34.76] (keyboard clicking)
[165:42.70] Okay.
[165:47.68] I'm just gonna...
[165:49.12] What?
[165:49.96] (soft music)
[165:52.38] (keyboard clicking)
[165:55.38] Okay.
[166:20.26] (soft music)
[166:22.68] Oh, okay.
[166:37.46] (soft music)
[166:39.88] (keyboard clicking)
[166:42.88] Got it.
[166:55.80] Okay.
[166:56.62] That's fair.
[166:57.46] (keyboard clicking)
[166:58.44] We can put that one in at some point anyway.
[167:00.74] (keyboard clicking)
[167:03.74] (soft music)
[167:06.16] Now I understand.
[167:21.46] Okay.
[167:22.28] So.
[167:23.12] (soft music)
[167:25.54] Test.
[167:27.92] Test.
[167:28.76] (soft music)
[167:31.18] the test.
[167:32.02] (soft music)
[167:34.44] (keyboard clicking)
[167:37.44] Okay.
[168:01.80] What's going on here?
[168:02.64] (soft music)
[168:04.00] Package.json.
[168:05.34] (soft music)
[168:07.76] No ripe MD.
[168:13.38] (soft music)
[168:15.80] That was the same.
[168:26.02] Those are Diffner.
[168:28.24] That one's Diffner.
[168:33.26] Okay.
[168:34.10] (soft music)
[168:36.52] Oh, okay.
[168:40.26] I pinged me on discord.
[168:41.16] I didn't see it.
[168:42.00] (soft music)
[168:44.42] All right.
[168:49.18] (soft music)
[168:51.60] Cached.
[168:55.74] Okay.
[168:58.56] This is,
[168:59.40] this is SecP stuff.
[169:01.90] (soft music)
[169:04.98] All right.
[169:05.82] Tweaky tills, all that.
[169:09.24] (soft music)
[169:11.66] All right.
[169:19.70] And then merge conflict again.
[169:21.68] (soft music)
[169:30.22] Ripe MD.
[169:32.04] (soft music)
[169:34.46] Continue.
[169:46.14] (soft music)
[169:48.56] Okay.
[169:59.54] This one's gone.
[170:00.38] (soft music)
[170:01.34] This one's gone.
[170:02.18] (soft music)
[170:04.60] That one's not there yet.
[170:07.28] (soft music)
[170:09.38] These two are the same.
[170:11.10] (soft music)
[170:13.52] Diffner.
[170:14.36] (soft music)
[170:16.78] All right.
[170:33.18] (soft music)
[170:35.60] Test.
[170:39.00] Fix tests for
[170:42.56] async functions.
[170:44.32] (soft music)
[170:46.74] And this one is
[170:49.80] (soft music)
[170:52.56] replace
[170:53.64] (soft music)
[170:56.64] node only ripe MD 160
[171:00.92] (soft music)
[171:03.86] with
[171:04.70] (soft music)
[171:05.96] node plus with
[171:08.00] (soft music)
[171:10.42] (keyboard clicking)
[171:12.78] use
[171:13.94] (keyboard clicking)
[171:17.02] vanilla JS
[171:19.02] (keyboard clicking)
[171:20.06] ripe MD 160.
[171:21.52] (keyboard clicking)
[171:24.52] (soft music)
[171:28.26] (keyboard clicking)
[171:31.26] There we go.
[171:47.70] Get rebase.
[171:48.72] (keyboard clicking)
[171:51.72] So if I just do a GIF,
[171:55.26] GIF of head here
[171:57.14] (soft music)
[171:59.56] Okay.
[172:10.46] So some of these is going to need to be replayed
[172:12.74] if we want to get them all in the right order,
[172:14.38] but that's basically it.
[172:16.76] (soft music)
[172:19.18] (keyboard clicking)
[172:22.18] (soft music)
[172:24.60] (keyboard clicking)
[172:27.60] (soft music)
[172:30.02] Hold on.
[172:39.12] (soft music)
[172:57.52] Okay.
[172:58.36] So in this fairyland version,
[172:59.32] we're just replacing ripe MD.
[173:01.40] (soft music)
[173:26.20] RipeMD.create and that's it, right?
[173:30.86] (soft music)
[173:33.28] Nothing else changes.
[173:41.48] (soft music)
[173:43.90] Cool.
[173:46.56] (soft music)
[173:48.98] (keyboard clicking)
[173:51.98] Okay.
[174:01.86] So that change is now isolated.
[174:03.78] (keyboard clicking)
[174:06.78] And then here,
[174:11.96] it's just going to gripe about that.
[174:16.34] That's fine.
[174:17.18] (keyboard clicking)
[174:19.10] And then it's going to gripe about this one as well.
[174:22.26] Uh-oh.
[174:23.10] (soft music)
[174:25.52] Shah.
[174:40.36] 256.
[174:43.90] (soft music)
[174:46.32] (keyboard clicking)
[174:49.32] Okay.
[174:57.76] So there it's moving over.
[175:01.16] (keyboard clicking)
[175:04.16] Okay.
[175:06.44] Everything's async,
[175:07.26] but we actually don't have the web crypt.
[175:08.48] We still have a little bit to do
[175:09.68] to get the web crypto bit in here.
[175:12.00] Don't we?
[175:12.84] (keyboard clicking)
[175:14.84] Because it's prepared for it,
[175:16.92] but it doesn't actually have it.
[175:19.32] (keyboard clicking)
[175:22.48] Okay.
[175:23.30] So now that actually finally ditches
[175:25.60] this in favor of that.
[175:30.40] (keyboard clicking)
[175:33.40] And then
[175:36.52] this changes.
[175:39.68] So ripe MD should stay the same.
[175:41.90] (keyboard clicking)
[175:45.66] (soft music)
[175:46.60] Good.
[175:47.44] (keyboard clicking)
[175:50.44] Huh.
[175:57.76] (soft music)
[176:00.18] (keyboard clicking)
[176:03.18] Noble sec p256k1.
[176:20.82] (keyboard clicking)
[176:27.78] Or this, right?
[176:29.32] (keyboard clicking)
[176:32.32] Okay.
[176:43.16] I'm a little confused.
[176:43.98] Oh, right.
[176:45.98] That's not there anymore
[176:47.18] because everything was moved up here
[176:50.66] for the browser compatibility stuff.
[176:56.64] (keyboard clicking)
[177:00.00] Got it.
[177:00.84] Okay.
[177:01.66] Now I understand why that's there.
[177:03.48] Like that.
[177:04.58] (keyboard clicking)
[177:07.58] Cool.
[177:15.00] (keyboard clicking)
[177:17.92] All right.
[177:24.70] Um.
[177:25.96] (keyboard clicking)
[177:28.96] Okay.
[177:33.70] So we're one more stream away
[177:34.74] from this actually being complete then.
[177:38.38] Okay.
[177:40.94] (soft music)
[177:43.36] (keyboard clicking)
[177:50.68] (keyboard clicking)
[177:53.68] Replace.
[178:01.44] (keyboard clicking)
[178:04.44] Okay.
[178:11.84] Let's go take a look at that PR.
[178:15.80] (keyboard clicking)
[178:18.80] (soft music)
[178:21.22] Wait.
[178:25.94] Async all the things.
[178:26.76] What is it failing on?
[178:27.78] Oh, interesting.
[178:32.42] (soft music)
[178:36.04] Oh, got it.
[178:48.88] Okay.
[178:49.72] Okay.
[179:02.32] So this, let's, okay.
[179:05.78] Yeah, when we swap out.
[179:09.96] Okay.
[179:10.78] So the last two things that should happen here,
[179:12.68] everything else should happen.
[179:16.22] Um, and the last two things that should happen should be,
[179:21.22] so async should be a separate thing actually.
[179:25.38] And then, and then crypto
[179:29.94] and secp256k1 should be the very last things.
[179:45.78] Cause if we, if we do that,
[179:47.34] then this maintains compatibility with everything.
[179:52.74] So everything else that it had compatibility
[179:55.02] with a few minor changes.
[179:57.36] And then the very last,
[179:58.42] the last two commits are going to be the crypto in this
[180:02.18] and dash keys.
[180:03.38] And those will be the dash specific commits.
[180:06.50] The, just those three and the rest of this.
[180:08.86] And maybe they use it.
[180:09.70] Maybe they don't, but it's atomic auditable or not.
[180:14.92] Maybe audible is not the right word, but you can look through and you can see that everything does work.
[180:22.52] And then that's good.
[180:27.92] Okay.
[180:29.22] Do do do do do do do do do.
[180:34.42] Okay.
[180:42.32] I could include everything in here that doesn't cause breaking changes.
[181:03.52] So everything up to the a sink could be in here.
[181:06.12] So we have everything up till a sink a sink and then breaking changes.
[181:12.22] That's the goal.
[181:14.92] Okay.
[181:15.32] All right.
[181:16.52] Well that I'm out.
[181:17.52] Thanks for joining in.
[181:19.12] Good to see y'all.
[181:20.12] Especially you Ryan because you actually chatted with me.
[181:23.02] You other people I see you there.
[181:25.32] You don't say hello.
[181:27.12] Oh, well.
[181:28.92] All right.
[181:30.12] I am out and yelled sometime early next week.
[181:36.12] I will get the rest of this nailed down.
[181:39.52] So what we have left and I might just make an issue for it.
[181:43.72] So I can get resettled easier when when I get to it.
[181:49.02] Is where did?
[181:53.82] Where did it go?
[181:56.42] Where did it go?
[181:57.12] Where did it go?
[181:58.22] Where did it go?
[181:59.32] Where did it go?
[182:01.52] All right.
[182:08.62] Figured it out.
[182:10.12] and
[182:13.52] Okay.
[182:25.22] Roadmap to v3
[182:35.32] PR for all non a sink updates minimal API breaks PR.
[182:47.12] So there's just a few things that can be taken into that put into that PR for
[183:00.02] a sink updates main taming node v10
[183:07.02] compat
[183:09.72] PR for
[183:16.72] hard-breaking changes
[183:22.32] I'm going to do this.
[183:24.02] I'm going to do this.
[183:25.62] I'm going to do this.
[183:26.52] I'm going to do this.
[183:27.52] I'm going to do this.
[183:28.52] I'm going to do this.
[183:29.52] I'm going to do this.
[183:30.52] I'm going to do this.
[183:31.52] I'm going to do this.
[183:33.52] I'm going to do this.
[183:35.12] Okay, so
[183:38.62] Okay.
[184:02.92] So
[184:03.42] And then actually first thing is
[184:07.62] republish - keys with
[184:13.62] base 58 check plus ripe MD
[184:19.12] plus
[184:21.12] utils
[184:23.82] But all the stuff everything's figured out.
[184:28.12] We are down to simply what?
[184:31.52] I was unexpected.
[184:33.92] Does that break?
[184:39.22] That might have to the break.
[184:43.12] What's going on here?
[184:45.12] Oh, no, it did not break.
[184:50.82] It did.
[184:53.02] I'm twisted.
[185:06.02] Okay, sorry.
[185:08.22] We're down.
[185:08.72] We're down to just we're down to what we're down to.
[185:11.42] All right.
[185:11.92] I'm out.
[185:12.52] Thanks for joining in like so follow if you want to so this is the dish
[185:16.02] - incubator Channel.
[185:17.12] This is where I do most of the - work some of it goes on to the other to
[185:21.62] the cool age 86 Channel still depending on on what it is sometimes when
[185:25.52] I'm starting something or I'm doing a more segmented piece of work that
[185:28.82] has more more broad
[185:30.42] application.
[185:35.32] So you can you can like sub follow - incubator if you want to because
[185:40.12] if you like what you like you get more what you like or cool age 86 or
[185:43.92] you know, go find some other stuff.
[185:45.22] Oh, I will do a raid since we are we do have do have people actively
[185:49.82] watching today.
[185:51.72] Last night.
[185:54.22] It was kind of quiet, you know, so let me see if I can get the stream
[185:57.22] tools up here.
[185:57.92] Okay, Ray and we are going to pick let's see.
[186:06.42] Like straggers live.
[186:10.52] Maddie two shoes is live.
[186:18.22] and
[186:19.22] Sam Griffin is live.
[186:24.82] I think we're going to pick either stragger or Maddie two shoes.
[186:31.32] Give me just a second here.
[186:46.32] Okay, wait, why can't I follow a whoops wrong wrong wrong window?
[186:51.92] I give me a second.
[186:54.52] Make sure I'm logged in here.
[187:02.22] Why don't I have a follow option?
[187:05.72] Well, here we go.
[187:15.22] I'm able to read so for some reason I still can't read so I'm sorry
[187:18.92] about that.
[187:19.42] We're not going to do a raid because I literally can't I don't I don't
[187:22.32] know what the
[187:23.02] Ryan
[187:25.42] carny auto.
[187:29.22] I will look up Ryan carny auto.
[187:32.62] I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
[187:37.22] I don't and I also don't I don't see a Ryan carny auto.
[187:45.12] You have to send me a direct link.
[187:47.62] Does he go by Ryan solid?
[187:53.92] But sorry, I like it for whatever reason.
[188:02.82] I'm going to try one more time here.
[188:04.52] And I'm really confused because I checked the channels verified.
[188:10.42] So I don't know why we can't raid.
[188:14.62] But
[188:17.32] For some reason that I don't understand right now.
[188:22.32] We still can't read.
[188:23.72] It could just be that the channels not 30 days old.
[188:27.72] All right.
[188:34.62] So and so's raid settings do not allow you to rate at this time.
[188:40.42] Let's see twitch.
[188:48.02] How do you use raids?
[188:51.72] I cannot read.
[188:52.82] Yeah, at least once at least one month old is a common thing.
[189:02.52] So I think once we get to be a month old, then we can read.
[189:05.02] But I followed Ryan solid and here's what I'm going to do, which is
[189:09.32] almost as good as rating, but not quite.
[189:11.62] I'm going to go into settings real quick and I'm going to go into.
[189:16.02] Hold on.
[189:19.02] Creator dashboard video producer settings channel featured content
[189:28.82] suggested channels.
[189:30.92] Ryan solid.
[189:34.42] Okay, so I've added Ryan solid to the list.
[189:37.12] So when I in the stream his stream should pop up soon about 30 seconds.
[189:41.52] He'll pop up if you can wait that long and I'm out Adios.
