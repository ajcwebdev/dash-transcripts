[144:26.14] you
[144:44.14] you
[144:46.20] you
[145:02.20] okay so apparently my mic has been muted this whole time
[145:13.20] well that stinks
[145:16.26] two hours in my mic is muted
[145:23.26] okay
[145:27.26] we have audio again
[145:31.26] oh no
[145:35.26] okay let me comment here on youtube whoops no over here
[145:48.32] uh
[145:57.32] uh
[146:08.38] i thought i had tested everything
[146:22.38] um
[146:24.44] all right so i've got no local backup on that audio either
[146:31.44] oh well
[146:35.44] here we go
[146:50.38] um
[146:52.44] just one second here
[146:56.44] um
[146:59.50] uh
[147:01.56] uh
[147:27.50] okay
[147:29.56] well that stinks yeah i'm glad
[147:47.56] uh
[147:52.56] oh
[147:54.62] okay audio audios audios back oh well oopsie
[148:18.56] all right where was i all right let's let's forget about that
[148:23.62] it's been kind of a slog anyway there was some good stuff at the beginning and i've talked about
[148:29.62] i've talked about the differences between the array buffers and and uh allocation and
[148:36.62] there was some good stuff in here maybe we'll repeat some of it tomorrow i'm getting kind of tired
[148:42.62] i want to finish this tonight i want to get to the point where we have testing
[148:47.62] um
[148:49.68] okay serialize
[149:05.68] so
[149:08.74] i'm a little bit confused
[149:31.74] so
[149:34.80] so
[149:52.80] so
[149:55.86] okay
[150:18.86] so
[150:21.92] so key is gonna be mostly empty i'm a little confused let's see what serialize looks like
[150:32.92] serialize can cat private key okay
[150:42.92] so
[150:45.98] private key so one plus key dot byte length
[151:09.92] ua dot set zero at zero ua dot set
[151:17.98] private key so it seems like private key is 44 bytes long is that what we're saying
[151:30.98] so
[151:34.04] so
[151:56.98] i can cat a zero byte and then the private key
[152:03.04] okay 148
[152:22.04] so
[152:25.10] oh
[152:31.10] yeah i just need to move this up here
[152:49.04] so there's the public key just have an extra byte oh
[152:54.10] i'm a little bit confused about this still though because a public key i think is just 32 bytes
[153:05.10] i'm not sure
[153:16.10] so
[153:19.16] the serial is the serialized function doesn't quite make sense to me right now
[153:42.10] so it seems like there'd just be a bunch of zeros in there
[153:46.16] serialize hdk versions private key
[154:00.16] okay serialize
[154:11.16] okay hdk depth
[154:15.22] the data view is the u8
[154:23.22] chain code
[154:39.16] okay well i mean i guess i can just run and run the test and figure out what's going on
[154:45.22] let me see if i can understand from this one yeah version
[154:59.22] sorry 13 chain code
[155:04.22] so
[155:07.28] so it makes sense if this was setting to key
[155:22.28] let me do a git diff on this
[155:32.28] and see chain code
[155:59.28] okay
[156:02.34] oops node buffer copy
[156:08.34] copy target start
[156:26.28] just seems like there's going to be a bunch of zeros
[156:30.34] so we're starting at 45
[156:52.28] i'm just so confused here because we're just going to throw the u8 away aren't we
[156:58.34] so we create a new u8 we create a data view for it we write a bunch of crap to it
[157:06.34] and then
[157:10.34] we're returning
[157:20.28] the serialized version oh wait i think i i think i understand now serialize
[157:28.34] let me look at this so we are returning the buffer
[157:41.34] okay i get it now
[157:46.28] i see where i was confused okay so we're setting the x key as what i want to call this
[157:53.34] we're creating a data view for the x key
[157:58.34] xkeydb
[158:03.34] all right i'm just gonna go ahead and set this up here like that
[158:13.34] all right and then
[158:20.40] okay
[158:24.46] so
[158:52.46] all right so there's the keys data view
[158:55.52] x key x key
[159:02.52] x key all right so there's there's 13 bytes of stuff going on here so we've got
[159:12.52] the version oh and this this makes more sense now this comment so the version and then the depth
[159:19.46] which is just one byte got it so that takes us to five and then the fingerprint
[159:23.52] that takes us up to nine and then the index that's four that takes up to 32
[159:29.52] i mean up to 13 and then the chain that gets us to the 45 and then the key is 33 bytes
[159:37.52] gotcha okay and the key is always 33 bytes regardless of whether it's a private key or
[159:44.46] a public key so i kind of want to go up here and say now i don't know where this lin comes from
[159:52.52] oh it's the whole length got it
[160:00.52] i can call that x key size
[160:08.52] i'm more okay with that
[160:14.58] and then we could say that key size is always going to be 33 because for a public key it's the
[160:26.58] quadrant and then 32 bytes so that's 33 and for a private key it's zero and then 32 bytes
[160:37.52] and so then here we could just do key size and that makes sense
[160:57.58] and then i'm not really sure what we would call this
[161:06.58] so it's the
[161:17.64] so it would kind of be
[161:32.64] um
[161:33.70] key index size would be
[161:42.70] okay
[162:01.76] all right so here's a plus four so this would be indexed key size
[162:12.76] and that's going to be the same no matter what
[162:15.82] so let's go ahead and move that here
[162:23.82] okay
[162:36.88] so
[162:47.94] okay that makes more sense now
[163:01.94] and this one is going to be
[163:13.94] 5, 11, 15, 47, 80
[163:39.94] is that what we're saying wait why is it not
[163:46.00] so why is this one different these two look exactly the same
[164:06.94] let's try this again 4 plus 1 is 5
[164:12.00] plus 4 is 9 plus 4 is 13
[164:20.00] plus 32 is 45
[164:28.00] plus 30 is 75 plus 3 is 78
[164:36.00] these two are exactly the same so we'd also do
[164:43.06] so
[165:00.12] do i need a key weight here
[165:07.12] i guess i do
[165:20.18] yeah all right
[165:23.18] okay i think i think i've finished the conversion the problem is
[165:30.18] there's no way to really test this in pieces you it's kind of an all or nothing deal
[165:35.18] so
[165:55.18] let's do a proceed buffer
[166:14.24] all right well let's at least uh give it a good old add
[166:24.24] whoop he went eight array
[166:29.30] okay let's get rid of that well i should have gotten rid of that a while ago
[166:48.30] so
[166:59.36] all right here we go so this would just be
[167:05.36] a mix safe buffer there
[167:14.30] okay
[167:18.36] i think that's going to be fine
[167:43.30] we're going to need a function x2u8
[167:51.30] array x dot length divided by two
[168:19.30] i equal zero i less than or equal to size right no what x dot length i plus equals two
[168:37.30] and then we got x i
[168:52.36] uh let's see hello
[168:56.36] subster whoops that's not what i wanted to do can we get that undone
[169:05.30] subster and then help me remember here two two versus substring okay subster okay
[169:16.36] subster this is the format that i like
[169:22.36] and then we can say i two
[169:27.36] let h equals
[169:33.30] u8 i won't let b equals
[169:38.36] parse int h16
[169:47.36] and then
[169:54.30] h8
[170:11.36] j equals b
[170:14.36] but i already did this so many times why am i doing this again i just did this
[170:19.30] and um
[170:21.36] dash tx let me just grab it from there x2 why in the world was was i writing that again i have no idea
[170:31.36] well i do have an idea it's because i was just a little sleepy i was just a little bit sleepy
[170:48.36] there we go
[170:53.36] hex to u8
[171:22.36] parse int
[171:24.42] right yeah that makes sense
[171:34.42] there we go
[171:37.42] okay so that's what i needed up here
[171:40.42] we don't need to buffer that from we need a hex to u8
[171:47.36] and we can get rid of that
[171:59.42] okay and then we need
[172:05.42] well that could just be u8 array
[172:10.36] i will i will my mind will be blown and i'll be so sad and so happy if from
[172:18.42] supports a
[172:26.42] element
[172:29.42] index
[172:32.42] from map function
[172:36.36] interesting
[172:42.42] okay i would be so happy if it supported hex after all this time
[172:49.42] but alas of course it doesn't
[172:54.42] you've taken happy pills
[173:03.36] secure random why in the world
[173:07.42] i mean
[173:10.42] the way to do this is var
[173:15.42] priv equals new u8 array 32
[173:24.36] then crypto dot ran get random values priv
[173:34.42] that's it where's the secure random idea coming from secure random
[173:45.36] what are they smoking
[174:10.36] hey it's some breath of the wild
[174:20.42] crypto equals require
[174:25.42] node crypto actually we just put that up here
[174:35.36] weird secure random
[174:42.42] okay oh one thing i was mentioned earlier is we got new musics
[174:59.42] okay
[175:04.36] i'm not sure oh
[175:24.36] this curve thing
[175:41.42] okay buffer
[175:46.36] that's interesting
[175:53.42] okay
[176:22.42] okay
[176:42.42] new u8 array 32
[176:56.48] okay i see what's going on there just checking that the different zeros still
[177:03.42] and 8 array 99 i don't know what that's about
[177:07.48] oh just to get just to see that the length is not correct okay hex 2 u8
[177:22.42] more of that
[177:33.48] and we're still all right we're getting close to the bottom
[177:48.42] oh man to believe that i got all of this right though it's uh
[177:57.42] it's harder to imagine
[178:20.42] guess we'll see
[178:31.48] here we go let's go
[178:37.48] that's my best let's go my very best one i saved it just for you
[178:49.42] the difference of this is so low
[179:16.42] let's see what happens
[179:35.42] all right run npm install
[179:46.48] npm test
[179:55.42] okay that's not so bad this is some stuff that actually makes a lot of sense
[180:14.42] 39 failing
[180:21.48] i should properly derive the chain path m
[180:27.48] so it's probably something super fundamental which is always good
[180:40.42] fixtures whoops test fixtures hd key
[180:56.42] public private seed cool well let's go ahead and try this out and see what we get
[181:25.48] test one
[181:50.48] here we go
[182:04.48] let's see here from master seed
[182:15.48] we need a little x2u8 here
[182:39.48] it's nice when the very first test fails because that's not subtle
[182:47.48] these bugs are difficult
[183:16.54] all right let's take a look here
[183:25.54] oh
[183:54.60] cannot find module
[184:08.66] whoa
[184:19.60] oh no now i've done it i've installed all of npm the whole thing
[184:40.60] my system is critically vulnerable okay
[184:52.66] okay valid
[185:07.60] the offset is out of bounds that's super easy you just need to put the offset in bounds
[185:36.60] i'm a little confused here
[185:38.66] this is console
[185:41.66] console.log
[185:44.66] take a peek at the chain key
[185:47.66] and take a look at the X key
[186:01.60] okay
[186:29.60] let's see what happened here
[186:31.66] so what it's supposed to be is xkey.set because this one was for copy but that's not
[186:39.66] it's not how it worketh over here
[186:43.66] and same thing here this should be
[186:52.60] xkey is going to call .set i've probably messed that up in another place as well let's see
[187:01.66] that looks right well now we don't use concat anymore
[187:05.66] because it turns out that it's not actually really helpful
[187:20.60] okay
[187:24.66] so we're setting that on the X key
[187:31.66] that makes more sense
[187:35.66] hello
[187:41.66] all right well good news my friends
[187:48.60] this has been it my confidence level has never been higher
[187:53.66] huh yo rune hey you found me i was trying to hide from you
[187:59.66] i thought maybe if i streamed under a different channel you wouldn't be able to catch me but oh you did
[188:07.60] uh how you doing man
[188:19.66] yeah well i'm i've got a few different channels now there's a channel for utah rest there's a channel for utah stack js
[188:27.66] there's a channel for coolage86 there's a channel for dash incubator
[188:34.60] so we got all the rounds now
[188:40.66] and then i i got the suggestion stuff set up too
[189:02.60] okay
[189:19.66] so i'm a little bit tired
[189:31.66] type of hd versions is not assignable to hd versions
[189:59.66] oh i need to not put that one there oh we need to get rid of these console dot logs
[190:07.66] put that back
[190:32.66] oops i accidentally deleted that
[190:37.72] that's okay
[190:46.72] so what i'm trying to do here
[190:51.66] is i've ported this from using node buffer to using uint8 array and it's been a little winding road because i had to refamiliarize myself with all the ins and outs and and you've got some ridiculous stuff so check this out all right so for example
[191:09.66] um if you use a data view set then the first parameter is the offset and the second is the value
[191:22.72] but if you use uint8 array set you can guess the first parameter is the value and the second parameter is the offset
[191:38.66] and if you use node.js copy then it's the target
[191:48.72] the source and the target are reversed so with set and both of these the caller is the target but with the node buffer the caller is the source
[192:05.66] so it's just a lot of little things like that where it's did i get it all right
[192:13.66] and then who knows about to find out for the second time oh wait uh hd so yeah we just with these two we just i accidentally changed a copy into a set but then that just needed to be a set wait that doesn't make any sense
[192:37.66] key oh sorry yeah so this one corresponds to this one x keyset chain code this oh yeah earlier i was looking at the thing i couldn't figure out wait something doesn't feel right but i can't articulate it right now
[192:51.66] all right so this is going to be you went eight okay so now i suspect it's going to get much further
[193:16.66] will it pass the tests that'd be cool i'm not going to hold my breath yet but
[193:36.66] miracles happen every day
[193:55.72] so
[194:08.78] let's see that's the correct one that's the correct one is that it is there anything else
[194:37.84] is there anything else
[195:05.84] let's see what's going on here
[195:09.90] so
[195:22.96] so
[195:41.02] there we go
[196:03.08] so
[196:13.14] versions
[196:31.08] all right let's see what it says
[196:38.14] canceled after 25 seconds well let's see why node 14 failed node 14 could have failed because lots of reasons
[196:55.08] all right
[197:05.08] all right nine failing which ones failed as it's showing down here these are the ones that failed
[197:26.08] oh get random values is not a function right okay so that one's failing because of its old node
[197:36.14] okay so with that
[197:43.14] i should just take that i should step that back a little
[197:54.08] so let's take a look here
[198:15.08] here
[198:29.14] get random whoops let me go to my test here so get random values
[198:38.08] what we should actually be doing here is get random bytes 32
[198:48.08] barrands there we go
[199:14.08] node crypto dot get random
[199:20.14] random bytes 32
[199:27.14] there we go
[199:29.14] so this should actually be random bytes
[199:43.08] that's what we do when we swap over to the web crypto all right so no big deal there
[199:48.14] no harm no foul
[200:04.08] all right you want a test there we go
[200:14.14] let's see how far we go this time
[200:21.08] oh i really just care about probably node 16 or so
[200:35.14] don't time out after 20 seconds on me you can do it you can make it all the way
[200:43.14] all right so it looks like there really is something wrong
[200:50.14] seven failing
[200:55.20] all right and this one's nice and easy too i like that
[201:00.20] so what happened here is that it's comparing with a double equals string coercion
[201:08.14] between and it's expecting the two string method to result in
[201:18.20] hex but it's not resulting in hex so it's actually not a problem at all
[201:29.20] so everything might be correct
[201:33.14] could be it may just be that we need to get the test updated to use the right
[201:40.20] format of key so assertion error
[201:45.20] what does it say when private should parse it
[201:58.14] equal chain code to string hex okay to string hex there is no to string hex
[202:06.20] we can do hex to u8 or we can do so we can do u8 to hex
[202:13.14] let me go grab that real quick much simpler function
[202:27.20] that just needs to be baked into the standard library it just really really
[202:31.20] does i just can't i can't think of any reason why it wouldn't be
[202:35.20] it seems so strange you know why would you not want this in the standard
[202:42.14] library why just why just why why spend months and years on these standard
[202:54.20] bodies and just never come up with usable standards that's the big question
[203:00.14] all right so we need to do
[203:21.20] there's gonna be a lot of these let's see if I can find a good way to do a
[203:26.14] replacer on these so we're gonna have a space and then there's going to be a
[203:31.20] bunch of stuff and then there's going to be a dot to string hex and we want to
[203:41.14] replace that with u8 to hex some stuff does that work looks like it did
[204:06.14] what is a that's going to be a buffer buffer buffer buffer buffer buffer
[204:16.20] buffer no but we'll come back to it no we'll come back to it no no okay what
[204:25.20] we need is to revise here hdkey that I think we can do
[204:35.20] okay then we need to find these ones that one
[204:53.20] all right there we go all right so this one is now yeah we're updating the test
[205:11.20] again test test all right I think it's possible it could it could pass now it
[205:25.26] could have just been that one was I don't remember what the thing was oh it
[205:30.26] was it was copying the copy was in the wrong order and this one it was just
[205:37.20] the wrong string method bless me the blessings are heavy with this one
[206:06.26] all right let's just see what no really
[206:17.32] deriving a child key must not mutate
[206:25.32] wait how could we even have more failing than we had before is this is
[206:46.38] this even the right do I need to just refresh this or something
[206:53.38] okay so I think let's see why node 14 failed
[207:10.44] driving a child does not mutate the internal state should not mutate when
[207:16.44] deriving with a private key okay I think I understand what's going on there
[207:22.38] that one that one doesn't blow my mind so this one if we're gonna derive a
[207:34.44] child there's a shared buffer when we derive a child we need to replace the
[207:47.38] shared buffer because I was trying to give it the same performance
[207:54.38] so let's see
[208:16.38] okay this is a new buffer
[208:28.44] okay let's see what's going on here so drive child passes in an index these are
[208:39.38] very variables so they're they're single use and we set and we make a copy of
[208:49.44] private key make a prop copy of index buffer we make a copy of the iBuff we
[209:01.38] make two versions HD here we set private key and then we do a tweaker so I wonder
[209:19.44] it wasn't clear to me why there were some of these new it new UN8 arrays and
[209:26.38] I'm wondering if the reason for it wasn't to make a copy it's one of these
[209:38.44] things about doing things on multiple lines is it's not super clear why
[209:46.44] something is the way that it is parent private parent key private child key so
[209:54.38] I think this tweaker my return whatever it tweaks so I'll slice iBuff okay
[210:06.44] that's all new data so let's see we make a copy here derived child and next plus
[210:15.38] one and let's try the same thing here let's do do public key copy and we'll
[210:25.44] take the public key and we'll make sure that this tweaker gets the public key
[210:35.44] copy just in case it operates directly on it then we've got the derived child
[210:43.38] and then this seems like it should be probably a child is that what this is
[210:53.44] HD set private key so that's derived child how about derive let's take a look
[211:04.44] at derive again and let's see is there anything where we would be modifying
[211:12.44] something that's the original HD key no it doesn't seem like it nothing
[211:24.50] there's attached to any sort of state so I'm gonna guess that what I thought was
[211:37.44] making a copy internally because I thought it was it why is there a buffer
[211:41.50] dot from on a buffer dot from you know you just we just made this thing it's
[211:46.50] obviously a buffer why is it a buffer dot from because it's not doing it to
[211:52.50] make a buffer it's doing it to make a copy and it's calling dot from because
[211:56.50] new is unsafe so so dot from does the business of allocating and copying
[212:06.50] in one function but this is why this is why I I'm becoming more and more
[212:11.56] convinced do one thing per line because then your variable name is the comment
[212:15.56] of what you're doing and so if you only do one thing for per line you actually
[212:20.50] don't need a lot of comments anyway copy key all right so let me go back here
[212:43.50] all right and let's see if we can just watch 16 again
[212:51.56] well that kind of sucks or is that you only get 26 seconds to run I mean
[213:04.56] that's that's npm install right there and then we're done hey did that work
[213:12.56] did that work that worked hey hey are you that worked all right cool so let's
[213:37.56] see according to that we can I want to see why node 10 fails but I'm sure it's
[213:44.62] something to do with you in 8 array or something you cannot find module node
[213:51.62] crypto okay all right let's let's let's not do the node crypto then just for the
[214:06.62] sake I want to see how low can it go you know I'm saying it's more of a
[214:33.62] complexity thing than anything else but all right cool so this is good
[215:02.68] all right I'm not surprised that this is failing but I would like to know why
[215:09.74] that's that's really text encoders not defined okay we're dropping support for
[215:22.68] node 10 obviously okay it was gonna come sooner or later
[215:47.74] all right what else do we need to do here so from this point we could apply
[216:12.74] some crypto stuff I'm too tired to do it but then we just need to figure out
[216:28.80] what to do about this tweak function which there is an issue open about where
[216:35.74] to get the different tweak function or where to something or other words and
[216:41.80] stuff I probably find it
[216:49.86] oops
[216:55.58] all right
[217:23.56] okay so we're gonna do this one here okay so we're gonna do this one here and
[217:39.62] then we're gonna do this one here okay so we're gonna do this one here okay so
[217:56.68] we're gonna do this one here and then we're gonna do this one here okay so
[218:17.68] okay oh and we still have the music I stopped the music that was me I can turn
[218:36.68] music on what to do here what to do what to do
[218:49.74] well it's time for me to go to bed that's what it's time for but trying to
[219:04.94] is there anything else before I go
[219:26.94] okay buffer buffer buffer buffer oh what the hey am I sultan or am I sultan
[219:43.10] let's go ahead and break the havoc of well
[219:51.74] okay
[219:54.74] oops
[220:23.74] whoops
[220:26.74] okay
[220:37.74] all right
[221:05.74] and then let's see here Nick's safe buffer add types to push out that get
[221:21.14] checkout ref simple chess cherry can get rebase - I'm a and then remove safe
[221:41.70] buffer no problems there and then check out rough types
[221:58.62] a race - I mean
[222:04.42] and we could check out rough you're a ray
[222:25.86] don't need that don't need that don't need that
[222:51.54] okay so first what I want to call this
[222:57.26] replace buffer node buffer with an 8 array
[223:07.30] what
[223:18.50] okay
[223:21.50] okay
[223:37.50] hmm
[223:40.50] okay
[223:43.50] okay
[223:46.50] okay
[223:49.50] okay
[223:52.50] okay
[223:55.50] okay
[224:22.50] let's see
[224:25.50] all right so I was going to reword this and this is fix update tests for you at
[224:44.02] a ray fix move not be 10 from test matrix
[225:09.70] no text encoder support okay
[225:23.78] so
[225:26.78] okay
[225:29.78] okay
[225:32.78] okay
[225:35.78] okay
[225:38.78] okay
[225:41.78] okay
[225:44.78] okay
[225:47.78] okay
[225:50.78] okay
[225:53.78] okay
[225:56.78] legacy
[226:03.78] legacy
[226:07.78] we're gonna go in this direction
[226:22.78] okay
[226:25.78] okay
[226:31.78] okay
[226:46.78] so if we really wanted to we don't have to drop node v10 we could do something
[226:54.30] else for text encoder if that's the only thing that's causing us die but but when
[227:00.50] we go to replace we could still maybe replace noble crypto first maybe I will
[227:08.66] do that next we could let node crypto be the last to die that would be kind of
[227:19.02] interesting so I would say well it's you know like I said it could could provide
[227:32.66] some sort of show let me think about this so with the text encoder how else
[227:43.98] could we do so this is just ascii text so there's nothing too cray-cray about
[227:48.66] it trying to think what would we need to do I think in that particular case we
[228:02.46] could do an ascii function ascii to uint8 array and then we could take in a
[228:16.02] str and we could just do str dot split or maybe it would be better just to go
[228:25.54] let u8 equals new uint8 array str dot length that's gonna work for ascii I
[228:41.30] mean even even we could just let me think for let i equals 0 i less than or
[228:59.86] equal to str dot length no i less than str dot length i plus equals 1 and then
[229:10.22] we could do u8 i equals str dot char code at 0 well this is what we'd have
[229:22.30] to do actually be let code equal let is that the byte is that the same as the
[229:47.24] byte I think maybe it is
[230:02.64] char code at yeah
[230:06.44] a pram string
[230:33.60] ascii plain 7-bit ascii string no special characters or emojis
[230:52.80] and I mean that's something we could precompute - I mean really if you think
[231:20.52] about it
[231:29.04] yeah so let's give that a try hold on just one second
[231:38.36] so new text encoder dot encode dot to string 16
[231:49.60] nope
[232:03.44] so we could do buffer dot from all that business
[232:10.88] let's see but then we still we still have no way to get that if we wanted to
[232:23.28] get that in bytes what would we have to do
[232:33.68] just thinking out loud here if I didn't want to use text encoder just keep
[232:40.12] compatibility broad if there's relatively no cost to it
[232:46.40] what do I do? u8 array dot from and I just put in
[233:08.40] 0x42, 0x69, 0x76, 0x63, 0x69, I guess 69 is letter island
[233:29.28] maybe not oh there's space yeah 69 is in what?
[233:44.96] no 6e is in okay
[234:01.60] I think that's reasonable actually
[234:31.12] okay
[234:32.12] so I'm going to do that again so I'm going to do that again so I'm going to do that again
[234:59.96] all right and that's fair enough
[235:15.08] wow I can't believe this keeps compatibility all the way back to node 10 if we just make
[235:19.96] that change there all right that's I mean that's not a bad trade-off okay but now I
[235:26.36] need to go to bed because I can't really think through problems anymore
[235:29.22] and then at the very end that's when we'll
[235:58.50] that's when we'll uh we'll drop the node support at the very because we can get literally everything
[236:09.26] we can't have everything working all the way back to node 10 apparently and then just the
[236:15.66] last commit will be dropping all that stuff because I really don't want to try to support
[236:20.98] it when well I mean even then I probably just have a couple lines I probably can support
[236:30.46] it because I just do one a single if just do a single if if crypto dot get random values
[236:38.22] or if crypto dot subtle and if not if not crypto dot subtle then you know put you know
[236:48.90] let's what it'll be I mean it's three lines per function it's three functions not 10 lines
[236:56.00] of code total 11 lines of code total I mean there's some spaces or whatever but yeah it's
[237:00.74] probably worth it that's not that's not a big deal to to not break things that work
[237:06.18] right as I'm always saying
[237:31.50] all right cool let's uh I just want to check and see and then I'm off
[237:58.88] so basically just just to kind of prototype this out while that's thinking maybe I can
[238:04.10] go ahead and click on details here so it doesn't time out on me um but what I'm thinking whoops
[238:12.12] that yeah yeah look at that ba da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
[238:40.24] da da da da da da da da so here's what I'm thinking
[238:47.92] (soft music)
[238:50.34] (soft music)
[238:52.76] (soft music)
[238:55.18] (soft music)
[238:57.60] (soft music)
[239:00.02] (soft music)
[239:02.44] (soft music)
[239:05.00] (soft music)
[239:07.42] (soft music)
[239:10.04] (soft music)
[239:12.46] (soft music)
[239:18.34] (soft music)
[239:24.26] (soft music)
[239:30.26] (soft music)
[239:36.64] (soft music)
[239:39.06] - All right.
[239:44.44] So I'm thinking we have a function
[239:47.80] somewhere down here in the depths.
[239:51.72] Let's say it goes right here.
[239:55.36] Create HMAC 512.
[240:00.02] (soft music)
[240:02.44] (soft music)
[240:04.86] So we add
[240:17.30] entropy and data.
[240:24.94] So there's entropy and there's data.
[240:31.92] And we say, if not crypto.subtle.
[240:35.08] (soft music)
[240:37.50] And there we go.
[240:43.76] Secret, salt or key.
[240:58.04] (soft music)
[241:00.46] Message or data.
[241:27.24] So let hash equals.
[241:29.16] (soft music)
[241:31.58] (soft music)
[241:34.00] (soft music)
[241:36.42] Hmm, okay.
[242:03.08] So that's it.
[242:05.28] That's our create HMAC function.
[242:07.26] And then
[242:09.68] to do webcrypto.
[242:26.84] So I had that one, but that one was kind of annoying
[242:29.16] and long, but I can copy that back.
[242:31.84] (soft music)
[242:34.26] Again.
[242:42.64] Oh, but then we gotta have the async.
[242:51.68] It's gonna go crazy.
[242:52.88] Yeah.
[243:00.80] So we have to, we still have to update everything
[243:03.92] for async either way.
[243:05.22] SHA-256.
[243:17.62] Buff.
[243:21.04] So there's our create HMAC 512.
[243:31.56] And similarly, we just have a SHA here.
[243:36.56] Function SHA-256.
[243:39.72] Buff at param UN8 array.
[243:50.68] And then buff and then returns UN8 array.
[243:59.04] UN8 array.
[244:00.50] Hash.
[244:02.98] Hash.update.
[244:19.96] Hash.digest is
[244:25.00] let's SHA-256 equals UN8 equals new
[244:30.00] UN8 array SHA-256 return UN8.
[244:38.00] And this would actually be async.
[244:53.00] So if crypto create hash.
[244:58.00] And then we get a little bit faster to do webcrypto.
[245:05.00] It'd still be async, but we can get a little faster.
[245:07.60] SHA-256.
[245:12.62] All right.
[245:20.80] My random bytes.
[245:22.18] Okay, so this one would be
[245:50.32] the same thing.
[245:51.16] Oops, else.
[246:02.00] (keyboard clacking)
[246:05.00] Get random values.
[246:25.16] And then we just, boop, plop it right on in.
[246:29.80] (keyboard clacking)
[246:32.80] Create HMAC 512, and then we would pass in here
[246:58.52] master secret and seed buffer.
[247:03.42] That's, I think, what we're looking at there.
[247:10.34] As possibly undefined.
[247:14.08] All right, we'll just do throw new error not implemented.
[247:26.58] (keyboard clacking)
[247:29.58] All right.
[247:40.08] Hmm, right.
[247:49.20] That's one of the reasons I wanted to use global this
[247:52.60] is because then with global this,
[247:54.24] it actually understands the type a bit better.
[247:57.06] Hmm.
[248:00.60] Yeah, I see that, okay.
[248:04.52] Window equals window.
[248:17.06] App type window.
[248:22.72] (keyboard clacking)
[248:25.72] Hmm.
[248:48.84] (keyboard clacking)
[248:51.84] Okay, this one.
[249:17.48] (keyboard clacking)
[249:20.48] Hmm, that's weird.
[249:35.68] (keyboard clacking)
[249:38.68] All right, so I'm just gonna tell that one
[249:43.96] not to grape at me about it, and we're done.
[249:47.44] Okay.
[249:51.08] (keyboard clacking)
[249:54.08] Okay.
[250:09.68] (keyboard clacking)
[250:12.68] Oh, okay.
[250:15.40] Oh, we'll check that out, Mr. Jojobite.
[250:18.92] Well, it's because of the way I'm detecting it.
[250:21.32] If I switch it back to detecting global this.window,
[250:23.92] then it works.
[250:25.28] But I was doing this for node 10
[250:27.56] 'cause I figured, eh, you know.
[250:29.80] (keyboard clacking)
[250:32.80] (soft music)
[250:35.22] No, this will not work because this is not JavaScript.
[250:44.92] This is ES20XDX.
[250:48.16] Well, at least up at the top,
[250:51.20] it says export default function,
[250:53.36] and then it's got, yeah, so that's 20XDX.
[250:56.28] It would need to be JavaScript, not ES20XDX.
[251:02.24] (soft music)
[251:04.66] Let's see.
[251:09.80] Yeah, so the global this.window will work,
[251:14.44] but the problem is just, and this is not a big deal.
[251:18.80] It doesn't really matter, but I was just,
[251:21.16] I was just thinking it'd be nice if it worked in node 10
[251:23.88] since basically the only things I found
[251:26.72] that don't work in node 10 are things like this,
[251:31.40] where, I wish I knew a simpler way to do that,
[251:35.12] but that's kind of,
[251:36.42] that's kind of it.
[251:41.76] Okay, what else was I looking for?
[251:44.48] Oh, okay, that solves all the linter problems, I think.
[251:49.32] Oh, right, I was checking to see
[251:54.72] was there anything else to do with crypto.
[251:58.52] Crypto, so we just create HMAC and then create hash,
[252:03.52] and so then if I put the browser version of that,
[252:08.34] I wonder, is there, there's not one for signing,
[252:13.48] but is there one for creating a hash web crypto sync?
[252:18.48] (computer chiming)
[252:21.40] Let's see, is there any sync?
[252:32.32] Nope.
[252:34.32] Sync.
[252:36.96] (computer chiming)
[252:44.20] (computer chiming)
[252:47.12] Okay, well, that's that then.
[253:03.30] Okay.
[253:09.76] (computer chiming)
[253:13.20] So if I could just,
[253:15.56] do you know anything about Mocha and async Jojobite?
[253:19.80] 'Cause supposedly you're supposed to be able
[253:25.50] to run these asynchronously.
[253:27.64] (computer chiming)
[253:30.56] (computer chiming)
[253:33.48] Let's see, for each.
[253:41.96] (computer chiming)
[253:44.88] (computer chiming)
[253:47.80] Okay.
[254:12.48] (computer chiming)
[254:15.40] I wonder if I just push this.
[254:29.42] Oh, it should.
[254:33.48] (computer chiming)
[254:37.66] (computer chiming)
[254:40.58] NPM, install Mocha at latest.
[254:49.74] (computer chiming)
[254:53.14] Mocho.
[254:57.54] Mocha.
[254:59.98] (computer chiming)
[255:02.90] (computer chiming)
[255:05.82] Mocha 5.
[255:15.58] Eh, whatever.
[255:22.46] Let's see, can I run the test locally?
[255:29.20] Nah.
[255:31.78] (computer chiming)
[255:34.70] Okay, hash 160.
[255:49.26] Okay, 418, let's see, what's on line 418?
[255:54.82] (computer chiming)
[255:57.74] (computer chiming)
[256:00.66] Hmm.
[256:18.24] (computer chiming)
[256:21.16] Get there.
[256:24.60] (computer chiming)
[256:27.52] Let me try.
[256:53.52] (computer chiming)
[256:56.44] Just for the sake of testing locally,
[256:59.76] I'm gonna see what happens if I run the test like this.
[257:04.26] Data must be a string or a buffer.
[257:07.90] Where's hash base coming from?
[257:15.82] (computer chiming)
[257:22.88] (computer chiming)
[257:25.80] Oh, did I forget to return?
[257:37.56] (computer chiming)
[257:41.68] UN8Array, hash.digest.
[257:51.36] (computer chiming)
[257:54.28] All right, let's try this one, 256.
[258:03.22] (computer chiming)
[258:06.14] That seems like that should work.
[258:19.50] (computer chiming)
[258:21.38] Okay, everything passes.
[258:23.74] So, npm install, save RIPEMD 160 at latest.
[258:28.74] And then what happens if I go back to saying
[258:44.50] that this npm test, hmm, data must be a string or a buffer.
[258:49.50] Okay, what about npm install save-incubator/ripemd160?
[259:11.78] Okay, and then ripe-incubator, ripemd.create.
[259:16.78] Okay, huh, I wonder why that makes such a big difference.
[259:38.34] Or did I not actually, let's see, SHA-256.
[259:43.34] Okay, yeah, it's returning U8, okay.
[259:52.74] Let U8 equals return U8, console.log U8, npm run test.
[260:04.06] U8, npm run test, un8array.
[260:09.06] Okay, so it is in fact returning the un8array
[260:16.06] in that version of it.
[260:31.38] Okay, okay, good to know.
[260:59.22] Okay, so how could this be a string, I don't know.
[261:04.22] RipeMD, that just doesn't seem right.
[261:16.26] Does the one that's packaged with this really not support?
[261:27.42] Great, did I add that, change?
[261:29.46] I think I must have.
[261:40.30] Okay, so this, oh.
[261:41.54] What is this hash-based stuff?
[261:52.18] (soft music)
[261:54.60] It doesn't do anything.
[261:59.94] What is the dash-incubator one based on then?
[262:12.26] Ah, whatever, who cares.
[262:16.14] Okay, I'm taking one last look
[262:19.14] and then I really am going to bed.
[262:21.28] (soft music)
[262:23.70] Okay, so.
[262:28.56] All right, so does this npm run test?
[262:50.52] (soft music)
[262:52.94] All right.
[262:54.96] Okay, so I guess I need to PR that or something.
[263:13.42] (soft music)
[263:15.84] Okay, so at least I can run the test now.
[263:37.92] So let me take another look at this.
[263:42.78] (soft music)
[263:45.20] Okay, do I have any more console.log in here?
[263:54.10] Console.log, nope.
[263:55.78] And then do I have any more crypto stuff?
[264:00.66] Nope.
[264:02.62] (soft music)
[264:05.04] Okay.
[264:17.42] Async plus crypto.
[264:25.86] And then if I go into here,
[264:32.42] (soft music)
[264:34.84] if I just turn,
[264:37.98] can I just turn every function in an async function?
[264:41.90] 'Cause if I can,
[264:44.62] let's do it,
[264:51.18] doot, doot, dot, star, function.
[264:58.14] (soft music)
[265:01.14] (keyboard clicking)
[265:04.14] I do one async function.
[265:15.14] All right.
[265:18.58] (soft music)
[265:21.00] (keyboard clicking)
[265:24.00] Oh, whoops, hold on.
[265:51.10] (soft music)
[265:53.52] There we go.
[266:10.24] It should work.
[266:13.98] That's hilarious.
[266:19.22] (soft music)
[266:21.64] (keyboard clicking)
[266:24.64] All right, so it says 45 passing.
[266:51.00] All right, I'm gonna take it a little further.
[266:53.00] I said I wasn't, but I lied.
[266:59.52] (soft music)
[267:04.34] Motrify, what is Motrify?
[267:20.60] Does that do anything?
[267:21.44] Are we using it?
[267:22.28] (keyboard clicking)
[267:29.94] Okay.
[267:50.52] (soft music)
[267:52.94] I think,
[267:56.12] (keyboard clicking)
[268:01.04] 6.3.
[268:09.60] I can get rid of that thing there.
[268:14.58] I'll just leave that alone for now.
[268:18.80] (keyboard clicking)
[268:21.80] 1.4.
[268:32.86] Let's see, will this run the test?
[268:37.62] Yeah, it'll run the test, okay.
[268:41.04] So I don't even need to change that.
[268:45.48] Okay.
[268:46.32] (soft music)
[268:48.74] Oh, whoops.
[268:59.56] (keyboard clicking)
[269:02.56] (sighs)
[269:15.68] Async the tests.
[269:17.22] All right, so.
[269:28.86] 256, so, at least the hash 160.
[269:40.60] This needs to go async.
[269:43.52] And if that goes async,
[269:46.04] (keyboard clicking)
[269:48.60] then it means that this needs to go async.
[269:52.56] And this needs to go async.
[269:56.64] (keyboard clicking)
[269:59.64] And then that means this needs to go,
[270:14.04] this needs to go,
[270:15.68] this needs to go,
[270:18.70] this needs to go,
[270:21.86] and then, oh, that one already is.
[270:26.52] Which means that this goes,
[270:33.20] which means that derive goes.
[270:36.28] So everything, basically,
[270:37.80] just everything becomes asynchronous.
[270:42.92] This becomes asynchronous.
[270:45.00] And then again, let's see.
[270:49.22] Oh.
[270:54.00] (keyboard clicking)
[270:57.16] Arrow I less than entries dot length.
[271:01.80] I plus equals one.
[271:05.60] (keyboard clicking)
[271:08.82] (keyboard clicking)
[271:11.82] Oh, then I need to do, let's see, equals entries I.
[271:18.20] And then this needs to become async.
[271:22.78] I don't think that serialize has to.
[271:34.08] Well, no.
[271:34.92] These are actually gonna become async too,
[271:38.48] 'cause the BS 58 check, when that's converted,
[271:41.54] that becomes async, which means these become async.
[271:45.20] And then this becomes await.
[271:46.80] And then this becomes await.
[271:50.40] Pretty much from the top,
[271:54.64] everything, I think every single function
[271:59.84] becomes async, except for create.
[272:02.86] (keyboard clicking)
[272:05.86] And the fingerprint.
[272:13.54] That one doesn't seem to get it either.
[272:15.46] (keyboard clicking)
[272:20.76] This one does.
[272:31.28] (keyboard clicking)
[272:34.28] (soft music)
[272:44.14] (keyboard clicking)
[272:47.14] (soft music)
[272:49.56] Let's see here.
[273:17.26] (keyboard clicking)
[273:19.26] Set buffer, maybe get string.
[273:21.22] I don't know.
[273:23.50] (keyboard clicking)
[273:26.50] Prompt seed.
[273:29.18] (keyboard clicking)
[273:32.18] HD from JSON, turns promise.
[273:46.16] (keyboard clicking)
[273:49.16] Fingerprint.
[273:56.42] Derive path.
[274:01.60] (keyboard clicking)
[274:04.60] (soft music)
[274:07.02] All right, we're gonna await that.
[274:27.18] Async this, await that.
[274:30.64] Okay, wipe private data.
[274:32.80] That one gets to stay.
[274:34.08] (keyboard clicking)
[274:37.08] All right.
[274:50.14] (keyboard clicking)
[274:54.14] (soft music)
[274:56.56] Okay, drive child.
[275:07.42] (keyboard clicking)
[275:11.38] Get private.
[275:19.22] (keyboard clicking)
[275:21.20] Okay, maybe get string.
[275:22.78] Maybe get buffer.
[275:24.10] (keyboard clicking)
[275:32.88] Promise.
[275:38.28] (keyboard clicking)
[275:42.78] Get private, extended.
[275:50.76] (keyboard clicking)
[275:53.76] Promise.
[276:12.64] Okay.
[276:16.94] (keyboard clicking)
[276:19.94] All right, there it goes.
[276:25.30] So there's that whole thing.
[276:26.66] (keyboard clicking)
[276:29.66] Async full send.
[276:33.40] (keyboard clicking)
[276:36.40] Let's see if we can get this thing to test.
[276:40.02] Basically, just anywhere there's a function, await it.
[276:47.66] (keyboard clicking)
[277:15.50] Arrive.
[277:17.00] (keyboard clicking)
[277:20.00] Child key to JSON that.
[277:24.90] Maybe I should actually have those,
[277:29.36] revert the behavior a little bit on that
[277:31.22] so that they compute ahead of time when you set the key.
[277:36.22] (keyboard clicking)
[277:40.00] (keyboard clicking)
[277:43.00] 'Cause the two JSON, it really stinks if it...
[277:49.84] (keyboard clicking)
[277:52.84] Where's this assert from?
[278:01.88] Right, right, okay.
[278:06.12] Oh, I remember what I did with this.
[278:08.88] But...
[278:10.40] (keyboard clicking)
[278:13.40] Probably doesn't handle asynchronous functions.
[278:25.88] (keyboard clicking)
[278:28.88] Oh no.
[278:34.12] Wait, this doesn't seem right.
[278:39.70] (keyboard clicking)
[278:42.70] Oh, so those have two hex on them, but they still work out
[278:51.78] because they both end up being the same thing.
[278:58.66] Yeah, okay, that makes sense.
[279:00.10] All right.
[279:02.38] 'Cause the strings are still the same,
[279:08.00] even though...
[279:08.90] Oh, their checking is wrong.
[279:15.10] We don't have to await that.
[279:23.42] We don't have to await private data,
[279:25.58] we do have to wait for the extended key.
[279:27.62] I don't think we have to await getPrivateKey,
[279:36.50] let me double check on that.
[279:38.80] (keyboard clicking)
[279:41.80] Oh my goodness.
[279:56.34] (keyboard clicking)
[280:00.82] (keyboard clicking)
[280:03.82] Oh my goodness, this is gonna be just so...
[280:12.86] This is impossible.
[280:14.08] Okay.
[280:22.94] It doesn't need it for getPrivateKey though.
[280:25.14] (keyboard clicking)
[280:28.14] Okay.
[280:33.80] So nothing like that for getPrivateKey,
[280:38.46] just for everything else.
[280:39.76] (keyboard clicking)
[280:47.12] (keyboard clicking)
[280:50.12] Okay, yeah.
[280:59.04] I think I will go back on the API
[281:02.00] for the getPrivateExtended
[281:03.88] and just have it eagerly create it.
[281:08.80] Otherwise, it's gonna be pure madness.
[281:12.92] (keyboard clicking)
[281:15.92] Okay, almost there, I think.
[281:31.92] That one technically doesn't need to have an await.
[281:41.96] (keyboard clicking)
[281:42.80] That one can...
[281:44.12] That one will throw right away,
[281:49.60] but I think...
[281:52.84] (keyboard clicking)
[282:10.00] Okay.
[282:11.40] So public key...
[282:14.84] Should not throw if the key is not compressed.
[282:24.76] I disagree.
[282:25.60] I think it should throw.
[282:26.64] But we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
[282:30.18] (keyboard clicking)
[282:33.22] (keyboard clicking)
[282:36.22] Okay.
[282:44.86] I don't think I'm gonna be able
[282:49.96] to finish this tomorrow, unfortunately.
[282:51.42] I'll have to wait till Saturday or next Monday.
[282:55.00] Or, I mean, the upcoming Monday.
[283:02.90] All right, where are we at?
[283:04.86] FromExtended, there's some awaits there.
[283:07.78] Versions, dev, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
[283:13.50] HG, should getPrivateKey.
[283:16.30] Describe, it should work.
[283:20.22] Okay, fromExtendedKey.
[283:22.46] And that sign's gonna have to have it, of course.
[283:29.60] (keyboard clicking)
[283:32.60] Verify's gonna have to have it.
[283:36.24] (keyboard clicking)
[283:40.24] (keyboard clicking)
[283:43.24] All right.
[284:01.08] (keyboard clicking)
[284:07.94] (keyboard clicking)
[284:10.94] All right.
[284:24.70] Get more private keys.
[284:29.46] All right, we're past the halfway point
[284:33.10] in terms of having a wait
[284:36.50] in front of literally everything.
[284:38.18] Well, not literally everything.
[284:41.82] (keyboard clicking)
[285:05.80] Oh, master seed.
[285:07.72] Derive, derive, derive, derive.
[285:16.76] Wow, there's a ton of them.
[285:18.98] Who would've thought you'd have so many function calls
[285:22.84] in a code, what, in a code?
[285:26.74] Did I just say that in a program?
[285:29.82] Oh.
[285:32.80] (keyboard clicking)
[285:36.40] Okay, getPublicExtended, getPrivateExtended.
[285:41.40] Oh no.
[285:47.62] Oh, that's something I may not have been
[285:53.68] thinking about in other places.
[285:55.24] Wait, that's only allowed within async functions.
[286:01.52] Where is it not within an async function?
[286:03.68] On line 270?
[286:05.44] Let's go back and take a look.
[286:06.94] All right, 283.
[286:21.82] (keyboard clicking)
[286:24.82] Where are we at here?
[286:43.52] Okay, from master key.
[286:46.76] (keyboard clicking)
[286:49.76] Wiped key, verify.
[286:56.88] Extended key.
[287:02.60] All right, I think that's it.
[287:13.04] I think that's all of 'em.
[287:14.48] (keyboard clicking)
[287:17.48] Okay.
[287:19.72] Failed every single one of 'em.
[287:26.68] Well, almost.
[287:27.56] Okay, let's see.
[287:35.84] Derive, where's derive used?
[287:40.92] Where's derive child?
[287:44.84] (keyboard clicking)
[287:45.96] There's derive child, there's derive child.
[287:48.32] Okay, why is it not working?
[287:57.80] Let's go back to this, to the test,
[288:00.48] and look for derive.
[288:03.18] Okay, let's look inside of derive
[288:08.32] and see if there's anything that we're missing.
[288:10.62] (keyboard clicking)
[288:13.62] It's hardened.
[288:18.82] Set.
[288:21.38] Await.
[288:24.86] Await.
[288:33.70] Await.
[288:40.38] Await.
[288:41.22] Await.
[288:48.58] Await.
[288:49.42] Await.
[288:54.34] (keyboard clicking)
[289:08.42] Okay, should properly derive chain path.
[289:11.66] Derive.
[289:19.34] Hmm.
[289:38.38] (keyboard clicking)
[289:41.38] I mean, this looks right.
[289:50.94] So let's take a look at from master seed,
[289:54.02] get private extended,
[289:55.38] console.log,
[289:58.66] HD key,
[289:59.98] child key.
[290:03.16] (keyboard clicking)
[290:06.16] X-prove.
[290:11.04] (keyboard clicking)
[290:16.48] F not private.
[290:26.80] All right, let's try running this now.
[290:30.40] (keyboard clicking)
[290:33.40] Okay.
[290:35.76] Okay.
[290:46.68] Should properly derive.
[290:51.32] Hmm.
[290:58.72] (keyboard clicking)
[291:01.72] (keyboard clicking)
[291:04.72] (keyboard clicking)
[291:07.72] (keyboard clicking)
[291:10.72] (keyboard clicking)
[291:13.72] All right.
[291:41.16] (keyboard clicking)
[291:44.16] C and I.
[291:48.00] (keyboard clicking)
[291:52.16] I don't know what's going on here.
[292:09.28] Any thoughts, Chet?
[292:10.28] (keyboard clicking)
[292:14.64] (keyboard clicking)
[292:17.64] (keyboard clicking)
[292:20.64] (keyboard clicking)
[292:23.64] (keyboard clicking)
[292:26.64] (keyboard clicking)
[292:30.24] (keyboard clicking)
[292:33.24] (keyboard clicking)
[292:40.24] (keyboard clicking)
[292:53.16] (keyboard clicking)
[292:56.16] I'm gonna go back to ref.
[293:08.32] (keyboard clicking)
[293:20.36] (keyboard clicking)
[293:23.36] Okay.
[293:30.44] Get checkout ref uint8 array.
[293:32.32] Oh, get checkout ref async.
[293:37.72] Let's push that up.
[293:39.06] (keyboard clicking)
[293:42.06] All right, so it updated the types.
[293:49.24] So let's say that we don't do
[293:50.56] any of the script test stuff at all.
[293:52.56] (keyboard clicking)
[293:55.56] And then let's say that we just change entries here.
[294:03.96] For let I equals zero I plus an entries dot length.
[294:14.36] I plus equals one, do all the things.
[294:19.36] Let's equals entries I.
[294:28.28] (keyboard clicking)
[294:43.96] Interesting.
[294:44.80] (keyboard clicking)
[294:49.24] Hmm.
[295:06.22] Okay, let's take a look at the last one
[295:13.56] that was passing.
[295:14.50] So git stash.
[295:16.88] Huh.
[295:20.00] (keyboard clicking)
[295:23.00] So something kind of subtle is happening here.
[295:42.24] (keyboard clicking)
[295:45.24] Because literally the difference between this
[295:49.76] is a for each.
[295:50.60] That does not make sense.
[295:53.06] (keyboard clicking)
[296:00.32] Is there maybe a return in there?
[296:05.16] Ah, there's a turn that needs to be a continue.
[296:11.62] (keyboard clicking)
[296:12.46] This is the way.
[296:13.28] All right, that makes sense.
[296:16.10] NPM run test, ah yes.
[296:20.70] (keyboard clicking)
[296:23.70] For each, for and prep for async.
[296:30.54] (keyboard clicking)
[296:36.66] (keyboard clicking)
[296:39.66] Okay, check out ref async.
[297:00.22] (keyboard clicking)
[297:06.26] Okay.
[297:07.10] (keyboard clicking)
[297:13.26] (humming)
[297:28.54] Hey, we've come all the way around.
[297:30.94] We've exhausted a few hundred songs.
[297:33.70] Wow, that's crazy.
[297:35.60] (keyboard clicking)
[297:38.60] All right, I don't know what the difference
[297:47.28] between these two is really.
[297:48.78] If we just put a wait in front of here,
[297:53.00] are they the same thing?
[297:54.20] They look like the same thing.
[297:56.66] (keyboard clicking)
[298:01.88] (keyboard clicking)
[298:04.88] Just ghosting the machine, maybe?
[298:08.26] (keyboard clicking)
[298:12.24] Okay.
[298:21.00] So way more passing now.
[298:25.46] All right, it should throw an error.
[298:30.00] (keyboard clicking)
[298:33.00] Okay.
[298:58.94] Realm master seed.
[299:00.72] (keyboard clicking)
[299:05.70] Okay, the other thing was,
[299:27.40] (keyboard clicking)
[299:29.90] should fail.
[299:31.42] (keyboard clicking)
[299:34.42] (keyboard clicking)
[299:37.42] (keyboard clicking)
[299:40.42] (keyboard clicking)
[299:43.42] - What a firework.
[300:05.82] (keyboard clicking)
[300:08.82] (keyboard clicking)
[300:11.82] - Let me see what we can do here.
[300:23.08] So we want to assert that
[300:25.80] this function throws.
[300:30.72] (keyboard clicking)
[300:33.72] (keyboard clicking)
[300:36.72] Wait, can that even work?
[300:49.06] How do we assert that it throws?
[300:53.48] (keyboard clicking)
[300:56.48] (keyboard clicking)
[300:59.48] Hmm.
[301:16.40] Hmm.
[301:24.40] I don't know what we do about that.
[301:26.96] (keyboard clicking)
[301:29.96] So if not regex.test
[301:47.08] error,
[301:49.56] throw
[301:53.08] (keyboard clicking)
[301:56.08] No error.
[301:58.80] (keyboard clicking)
[302:03.80] So, should fail, good fail.
[302:17.32] (keyboard clicking)
[302:20.32] (keyboard clicking)
[302:23.32] I think this is basically it.
[302:34.76] (keyboard clicking)
[302:37.76] (keyboard clicking)
[302:40.76] Okay, do we have, does node have a
[303:01.60] async throw?
[303:04.52] (keyboard clicking)
[303:08.52] (keyboard clicking)
[303:11.52] Okay, assert.regex.
[303:17.04] Okay, there we go.
[303:18.86] That's what we need.
[303:21.08] So let's undo all that.
[303:23.20] (keyboard clicking)
[303:26.20] (keyboard clicking)
[303:29.20] (keyboard clicking)
[303:33.20] (keyboard clicking)
[303:36.20] (keyboard clicking)
[303:39.20] (keyboard clicking)
[303:42.20] (keyboard clicking)
[303:45.20] (keyboard clicking)
[303:48.30] Okay.
[303:49.14] (keyboard clicking)
[303:52.14] (keyboard clicking)
[303:55.14] Okay.
[304:20.24] (keyboard clicking)
[304:23.24] (keyboard clicking)
[304:26.24] (keyboard clicking)
[304:29.24] (keyboard clicking)
[304:32.24] (keyboard clicking)
[304:35.24] All right, let's try this one.
[305:02.22] Okay, we've only got one failing.
[305:04.26] And I think that that's just because
[305:07.78] wipe private data from here.
[305:12.78] (keyboard clicking)
[305:17.90] There we go.
[305:19.80] (keyboard clicking)
[305:23.02] So we gotta clean that up, but oh wait, nope.
[305:25.46] Should be able to verify signatures.
[305:30.12] Verify.
[305:33.18] (keyboard clicking)
[305:36.18] Hmm.
[306:00.68] (keyboard clicking)
[306:03.68] All right, so should be able to verify signatures.
[306:11.50] Full key sign hash.
[306:25.76] Wiped key verify.
[306:30.56] (keyboard clicking)
[306:33.56] Oh, whoops.
[306:38.84] There it is.
[306:39.66] (keyboard clicking)
[306:44.84] Oh, come on, still?
[306:50.54] I thought I got it.
[306:58.24] (keyboard clicking)
[307:01.24] Let's try this.
[307:24.96] Suspected sig.
[307:27.52] Okay, that's a little too,
[307:34.16] about 22 and then,
[307:36.98] nope.
[307:39.72] 272, 272.
[307:43.40] Okay.
[307:53.84] All right, and where was this problem?
[307:55.74] Verify.
[307:57.68] 346.
[308:00.36] Let's look for it on the test.
[308:03.70] 346 and then 269.
[308:06.36] 346.
[308:08.08] 346 hash.
[308:11.68] Sign hash.
[308:15.80] Okay, let's see if we can break that down.
[308:19.76] What was the other one?
[308:21.56] 269.
[308:23.84] 269.
[308:27.28] It makes it difficult to tell where an error's coming from
[308:29.76] when it's like this because, let's see.
[308:33.16] Public key hash.
[308:36.32] So verify hash and signature.
[308:38.84] Sign.
[308:40.48] ECDSA sign.signature.
[308:42.48] It seems like.
[308:45.26] (keyboard clicking)
[308:48.26] Give it a raise the hash.
[308:58.70] Okay.
[309:03.54] Sig.
[309:09.46] Let sig equals.
[309:11.22] (keyboard clicking)
[309:14.22] Probably the await.
[309:19.14] Hey!
[309:29.10] All right, cool.
[309:30.30] (air horn blaring)
[309:33.66] All right, so that's now.
[309:36.26] I need some cleanup, but.
[309:38.94] (air horn blaring)
[309:41.94] (keyboard clicking)
[309:45.02] (keyboard clicking)
[309:48.02] (keyboard clicking)
[309:51.98] (air horn blaring)
[309:54.98] (keyboard clicking)
[309:57.98] Okay.
[310:23.62] (keyboard clicking)
[310:26.62] Okay, so then what's left here?
[310:33.10] We have to do
[310:34.26] these two.
[310:37.46] We gotta do some cleanup.
[310:38.58] So we would do, for example,
[310:45.82] dash incubator.
[310:51.62] And then, I guess, we might as well for that one as well.
[310:54.46] (keyboard clicking)
[310:58.74] Whoops.
[311:12.82] (keyboard clicking)
[311:15.82] All right.
[311:31.54] This one's gonna become.
[311:40.58] (keyboard clicking)
[311:42.86] This is just gonna become part of dash keys.
[311:45.02] That's where that one's gonna go.
[311:46.70] This one's also gonna go into dash keys.
[311:48.86] This one's gonna stay separate.
[311:51.50] That'll be it.
[311:54.70] We'll bring the crypto stuff back in.
[311:58.86] So now that I've got all the test passing async
[312:01.10] without any of the crypto changes,
[312:02.98] I'm highly confident that I can get it passing
[312:05.62] with the crypto changes,
[312:06.62] 'cause now I actually know it's not
[312:09.66] just all the async stuff.
[312:11.26] Okay.
[312:17.54] But when we do the async await bit,
[312:25.86] I think that's also where
[312:28.82] some node is gonna fail more often now.
[312:33.62] Let's go ahead and just check.
[312:34.78] I just wanna see what happens here.
[312:37.50] Refactor async all the things.
[312:42.50] It's not gonna be here, we're gonna do it there.
[312:48.82] And we're gonna do it on main.
[312:50.42] All right, what else?
[313:01.26] (upbeat music)
[313:03.86] So we got the crypto.
[313:13.14] All right, that's not gonna like that anymore.
[313:20.02] And we got the tweak.
[313:20.86] We got the tweaking medoodle.
[313:23.30] Let me go check on the tweaking medoodle
[313:26.22] while I'm thinking about it.
[313:27.78] Noblesecp256k1.
[313:32.78] There we go.
[313:38.02] And then somebody in the issue
[313:40.34] was mentioning about the tweak.
[313:44.18] (upbeat music)
[313:46.78] (upbeat music)
[313:49.38] (upbeat music)
[313:51.98] Let's see.
[314:17.98] (upbeat music)
[314:20.58] Point add functions.
[314:23.90] (upbeat music)
[314:26.50] Let's see, sometimes I ask a question,
[314:43.58] then I find an answer and I put it in a comment.
[314:47.50] Hmm.
[314:48.34] 'Cause eventually I did find
[314:51.74] whatever it was he was talking about.
[314:55.66] So.
[315:07.86] (upbeat music)
[315:10.46] Okay.
[315:26.10] Secp256k1 tweak.
[315:32.54] Let's see.
[315:36.26] (upbeat music)
[315:38.86] All right, so we're gonna get that somehow.
[315:44.34] All right, async all the things.
[315:56.98] And it fails in node 10,
[316:00.46] which is no surprise.
[316:02.46] And I'm not doing anything with callbacks
[316:05.50] to support node 10.
[316:06.82] So it looks like node 10 just needs to drop off.
[316:09.06] There's so many little things that are kind of annoying.
[316:12.34] We can get all the way up to
[316:16.46] being able to replace the crypto with something else.
[316:21.56] And that's as far as we can go for node 10.
[316:26.70] Okay.
[316:30.78] (upbeat music)
[316:33.36] Let's see.
[316:39.14] I'm guessing it's because it's async is not a keyword.
[316:47.86] Text encoder is not defined, what?
[316:51.26] But I'm not using text encoder.
[316:54.38] Oh, it dash and give error.
[316:56.98] Okay.
[316:57.82] Interesting.
[317:00.18] (upbeat music)
[317:02.26] Okay, so async was available back in node 10.
[317:05.58] I don't believe that.
[317:07.46] Let's see, but text encoder.
[317:10.90] I don't think that I can.
[317:13.26] Let's see, RiveMD.
[317:14.82] Could we do something else for that?
[317:19.62] Could we?
[317:20.46] Nah, it's just not worth it.
[317:21.86] Okay.
[317:25.66] Cool, so basically at this point,
[317:27.48] what do we have left?
[317:29.42] Hold on.
[317:30.42] (upbeat music)
[317:33.00] Okay, so we need to get that over
[317:58.42] and then replace a few more.
[318:00.20] The couple of dependencies is not a big deal.
[318:04.30] So good at all working.
[318:06.46] Okay, so the next time I spend some time on this,
[318:10.20] it will get it working.
[318:11.94] Next time I'm able to spend some time on it,
[318:15.86] which hopefully will be, I don't know, maybe Monday.
[318:21.22] I've got some other stuff
[318:24.78] I need to do Friday and Saturday, I think.
[318:26.82] (upbeat music)
[318:29.40] Okay.
[318:54.22] (upbeat music)
[318:56.80] Update RiveMD 160
[319:03.72] to work in browsers, UN8 array.
[319:13.28] So this one is done.
[319:16.04] (upbeat music)
[319:18.62] Update.
[319:24.86] (upbeat music)
[319:25.98] BS 58, check.
[319:29.06] To work in browsers.
[319:31.96] Work is at dash incubator.
[319:37.52] Base 58, check.
[319:41.12] (upbeat music)
[319:43.70] (keyboard clicking)
[319:46.70] (keyboard clicking)
[319:50.70] (keyboard clicking)
[319:53.70] (keyboard clicking)
[319:58.08] (keyboard clicking)
[320:09.00] (keyboard clicking)
[320:12.00] Okay.
[320:35.96] Well, sorry, this has been a lame stream,
[320:40.32] but can't be all winners all the time.
[320:44.08] And it kind of sucks that it started out with no audio,
[320:46.36] but what do you do?
[320:48.32] Such is life.
[320:50.00] Okay, I'm gonna pause the music.
[320:53.68] I'm gonna do something, I'm gonna stop the this my Bob.
[320:59.56] I'm gonna, I don't know what else I'm gonna do,
[321:01.80] but I'm gonna peace out.
[321:05.40] A little bit more fanfare, maybe.
[321:08.28] ‚ô™ This was a triumph ‚ô™
[321:11.98] ‚ô™ I'm making a note here, huge success ‚ô™
[321:16.98] All right.
[321:18.14] All of the, the only thing that has
[321:25.56] a question mark by it at this point,
[321:27.68] 'cause we know the web crypto stuff
[321:30.92] is pretty highly likely to work.
[321:34.48] And we've already got it done.
[321:35.88] I mean, assuming that the algorithm's the same,
[321:38.96] and we could probably get around that stupid HMAC problem
[321:43.78] just by doing a digest that,
[321:46.02] that hashes the two things together.
[321:51.68] 'Cause I'm pretty sure that's all HMAC is,
[321:53.44] is just when you hash data and then hash the secret
[321:58.44] and then hash the data, you know,
[322:02.16] do an update on the digest.
[322:04.48] So just concatenate those together.
[322:06.20] And I'm, I think that's what an HMAC is anyway.
[322:08.76] So there's that.
[322:11.28] And then there's the, there's the, this one,
[322:14.40] this one, just getting that,
[322:15.72] figuring out where that tweak function is.
[322:18.26] And Dagnabit, I know I found it somewhere.
[322:20.62] Now I don't know where it is.
[322:22.08] Why don't you take one more quick look at that?
[322:26.04] Because, let's see, is there anywhere I am the author?
[322:31.04] No.
[322:31.88] I know there's a few where I'm the author.
[322:37.60] Okay, clarify usage of this compressed pull request.
[322:41.96] Oh wait, what?
[322:51.08] Oh, this looks good.
[322:57.28] (keyboard clicking)
[323:00.28] Nice, that's really nice.
[323:11.54] That's great.
[323:16.92] Look at that.
[323:17.76] Remove features.
[323:20.84] Ooh, ooh.
[323:23.60] How nice.
[323:24.44] (keyboard clicking)
[323:27.44] Ah, well, we'll have to see, because we may need.
[323:36.28] I can take away the snore, that's fine,
[323:50.40] but there's some stuff we need.
[323:53.16] (keyboard clicking)
[323:56.16] Yay.
[324:08.08] All right, cool.
[324:16.70] Yay.
[324:20.84] (keyboard clicking)
[324:23.84] Oh no.
[324:28.92] That's actually, I don't know that we want that.
[324:35.24] I think that having the ASN1 bytes is good.
[324:42.46] (keyboard clicking)
[324:45.46] Okay, recovery bit.
[324:53.78] Okay, it's not called quadrant, it's called recovery bit.
[324:56.62] (keyboard clicking)
[325:00.62] Okay.
[325:10.98] (keyboard clicking)
[325:13.98] That's not, during coding is literally,
[325:24.70] it's, well, it's super simple, so if this is what we get,
[325:30.78] it's literally just having a varint encoding of the length,
[325:40.10] so we can still do that if we do decide to upgrade.
[325:44.34] Verify strict.
[325:47.14] Recover public key.
[325:52.66] Oh, I don't know if I like that, but whatever.
[326:07.22] Okay, probably won't be able to use this
[326:10.90] because the names of things might've been changed.
[326:14.94] Well, let's see, does this still have the tweak?
[326:17.86] Let's see.
[326:18.70] Index.ts, does it still?
[326:24.54] Can we just look at that?
[326:31.30] (keyboard clicking)
[326:34.30] Well, that's great.
[326:38.44] That's so awesome that he's dropping the big int library.
[326:43.44] That's just great.
[326:47.04] Remove craft, remove features.
[326:54.62] Keep it nice and tight.
[326:56.40] Okay, switch to noble curbs.
[327:00.50] (keyboard clicking)
[327:04.06] All right, that's cool.
[327:07.86] Hmm.
[327:18.50] Yeah, that problem.
[327:28.20] (keyboard clicking)
[327:31.20] Add library to important projects.
[327:40.52] Cosmos.
[327:45.82] Nice, okay.
[327:57.34] But what I needed to know,
[327:58.94] let's see if we can still find tweak.
[328:06.30] No, or add.
[328:08.48] Is there an add?
[328:10.62] There is an add.
[328:13.66] Okay, what about, what about, was it in the test?
[328:23.98] Where was it?
[328:26.66] Tweak, tweak utils.
[328:29.54] Here it is, tweak utils.
[328:30.82] Private add.
[328:31.66] This is, this is it.
[328:33.34] This is what we need.
[328:35.02] Private, tweak utils, private add,
[328:38.54] and point add scaler.
[328:42.74] So let me go back here.
[328:46.26] I don't know, I don't think that.
[328:54.06] Okay, so then if I look here,
[328:56.62] where's the tweak?
[328:59.42] Tweak.
[329:02.14] Public key tweak add.
[329:06.26] (keyboard clicking)
[329:09.26] Private key tweak in hex.
[329:31.16] So let's see.
[329:33.34] (keyboard clicking)
[329:36.34] Okay.
[329:37.94] Private key, and that's, this is the tweak,
[329:41.54] is the IL, right?
[329:43.82] Create HMAC, yeah.
[329:45.04] So here's the tweak.
[329:46.14] The tweak is IL, so we can get that in hex.
[329:49.30] So that we can pass that in.
[329:53.86] (keyboard clicking)
[329:58.30] (keyboard clicking)
[330:01.30] And then private key.
[330:09.58] Okay.
[330:17.46] I think, I think this is it, point add scaler.
[330:25.54] I think this is public.
[330:28.22] Let's see, P is hex, tweak is hex, compressed.
[330:31.90] If we look here, key, tweak, and compressed.
[330:36.90] So I'm pretty sure that's public.
[330:41.98] And it's called tweak add, not tweak multiply.
[330:47.30] So I think that's it.
[330:48.62] I think that we can replace it,
[330:53.10] maybe not with, maybe with the latest version,
[330:55.34] maybe, I don't know.
[330:57.34] I'm not sure if we're going to replace it
[331:01.10] with the latest version or not,
[331:02.66] but we should be able to replace it
[331:04.98] with the current version that we had from a month ago.
[331:09.26] And then we can look at using the updated version later.
[331:14.14] All right, now I'm really, really, really,
[331:15.58] really, really, really, really, really out.
[331:17.46] Adios.
