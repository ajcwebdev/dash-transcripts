## Episode Description

Claude discusses and documents the Dash HD wallet library, updating code, API methods, and documentation for various HD key types and derivation processes.

## Episode Summary

In this lengthy coding session, Claude works on updating and documenting the Dash HD wallet library. The focus is on refining the API, improving type definitions, and enhancing the documentation for various HD key types and derivation processes. Claude goes through different methods like toWif, toAddress, toXPrv, and toXPub, updating their implementations and documentation. There's considerable attention given to explaining BIP44 key hierarchy, discussing the semantics of different HD key depths, and clarifying the use cases for sharing XPubs. Throughout the session, Claude iterates on code examples, type definitions, and explanatory text, aiming to make the library more understandable and user-friendly.

## Chapters

00:00 - Introduction and Initial Code Review

Claude begins the session by reviewing the current state of the Dash HD library code. He discusses the need to update documentation for various methods and their options. This chapter sets the tone for the extensive code review and documentation process that follows.

In this introductory segment, Claude outlines the goals for the session, which include updating method documentation, refining type definitions, and improving overall code clarity. He starts by examining the existing codebase, identifying areas that need attention, and planning the approach for the updates.

06:54 - Updating toWif and toAddress Methods

Claude focuses on updating the toWif and toAddress methods. He refines the documentation, updates the method signatures, and ensures consistency in the API design. This chapter demonstrates the careful consideration given to each method's functionality and how it fits into the larger library structure.

The discussion in this chapter revolves around the specific parameters these methods accept, their return types, and how they should be documented. Claude pays particular attention to making sure the documentation is clear and helpful for potential users of the library.

13:32 - Refactoring and Improving Type Definitions

This chapter covers Claude's efforts to refactor the code and improve type definitions. He discusses the challenges of maintaining consistency across different parts of the library and works on creating more precise and useful type definitions for HD keys and related concepts.

Claude spends time thinking about how to best structure the types to represent the hierarchical deterministic nature of the keys. He considers various approaches to make the types both accurate and intuitive for developers using the library.

28:58 - Documenting BIP44 Key Hierarchy

Claude delves into documenting the BIP44 key hierarchy. He explains the different levels of derivation, from master keys to individual addresses, and how they relate to each other. This chapter provides valuable insights into the structure of HD wallets and how they are implemented in the Dash HD library.

The discussion covers the various depths in the BIP44 hierarchy, explaining what each level represents and how keys at different levels are derived and used. Claude works on creating clear explanations and examples to illustrate these concepts.

45:27 - Implementing and Documenting derivePath and deriveChild Methods

This chapter focuses on the implementation and documentation of the derivePath and deriveChild methods. Claude explains how these methods work, their parameters, and their use cases. He provides code examples to illustrate how developers can use these methods to derive keys at different levels of the HD hierarchy.

Claude spends time ensuring that the documentation for these methods is comprehensive and includes relevant examples. He also discusses the performance implications of deriving keys and best practices for using these methods efficiently.

65:09 - Explaining XPub Sharing and Use Cases

Claude dedicates this chapter to explaining the concept of XPub sharing and its various use cases. He discusses scenarios where sharing an XPub is beneficial, such as receiving repeated payments or allowing applications to derive addresses on behalf of a user. This section provides important context for understanding the practical applications of HD wallets.

The discussion covers the privacy and security implications of sharing XPubs, as well as the benefits in terms of convenience and automation. Claude works on crafting clear explanations to help users understand when and how to use this feature of the library.

89:10 - Finalizing Documentation and Future Plans

In the final chapter, Claude wraps up the documentation process, reviews the changes made, and discusses plans for future improvements. He considers additional topics to cover in the documentation, such as adding a glossary of terms and refining the quick start guide.

This concluding segment involves a reflection on the work done during the session and planning for next steps. Claude discusses potential areas for further improvement and considers how to make the library even more accessible and user-friendly.

## Transcript

[00:00] [music]
[00:17] Okay, hello hello and welcome back. I had just started and then realized I hadn't actually hit record.
[00:23] So, meh, whatever. Oh, this is what we were going to be looking at. Okay, so I am going through
[00:35] Dash HD and just updating documentation to this point. I need to get all the methods documented
[00:40] with their options and such and so that's what I'm doing. So, it shouldn't be anything too
[00:46] challenging or difficult. Just going through and making sure we have options specified and such.
[00:58] Okay.
[01:01] All right, so I think Twwif was where I left off and I need to figure out what is the actual
[01:13] version byte that we send for this. The actual version byte was...
[01:23] Encode key, I think.
[01:31] Oh, Twwif. Does Twwif... Ah, I haven't moved that one in yet. So, that's still in the examples.
[01:43] So we're going to change -keys to -hd for "toWiff" and "toAdder".
[01:54] "toWiff" "toWiff" "toAdder" "toAdder" "toAdder" "toWiff" "toWiff" "toAdder" "toAdder" "toAdder"
[02:04] "toWiff" "toAdder" There we go.
[02:08] So I should be able to run this and it should work. Yep, it does. We're going to take
[02:15] this "toWiff" and "toAdder" and we're going to move it over.
[02:36] I should document the utils as well.
[02:38] W-X-Y-Z, right, so "toWiff" and "toAdder" will come first.
[02:50] Let's see, "toWiff", well, "toAdder" should come first.
[03:01] And this would be "toAdder" and "toWiff". And I think I need to rename these,
[03:12] hold on just a second here, "hd.gitx.priv" should be "hd2.xpriv".
[03:25] And then "hd.gitx.pub" should become "hd2.xpub".
[03:31] Okay.
[03:48] And so we're going to have "toWiff" and "toAddress".
[04:11] Then we need to say, let's see, "object.string".
[04:19] "string". It's going to be "ops", same here. And really it's just "version"
[04:29] is all that we're worried about. I'm just going to leave it "string string" for now.
[04:38] Or I guess I'll go ahead and "typedef" it.
[04:47] And it will be, we'll just have a property here,
[04:59] "string version". And it's a little bit more strict than that, but I'm going to keep it as
[05:05] "string version" for now because it could potentially be broader than what I currently have defined.
[05:13] Let's see.
[05:21] "hd2.address.ops", there we go. And this is going to be the same thing.
[05:36] All right, there we go.
[05:40] Okay, what was I upset about?
[05:48] [clears throat]
[05:52] I already put this on here. "-hd", "toAdder".
[05:58] This is actually going to be "privBytes".
[06:16] And this is going to be "pubBytes".
[06:22] Okay, there we go.
[06:43] Oh, and this one actually should be on top.
[06:46] And we can get rid of that definition. All right, there we are.
[06:53] Now this looks right.
[07:00] Let's make sure it still runs. And it still runs, good.
[07:05] [typing sounds]
[07:26] Okay, let's go back to README here. Oh, and I do need to actually look and see down in "dash keys"
[07:35] what are...
[07:36] It would be nice if I could...
[07:41] If I could get the exported type here, that would be really cool.
[07:49] Let me try that. Let me just see if it works. I don't think it does right now.
[07:53] [typing sounds]
[08:08] Let's see if I can get rid of this.
[08:09] Okay, so that's good.
[08:20] Ugh, does not exist on type of "dash keys".
[08:28] [typing sounds]
[08:35] Let's see.
[08:37] [typing sounds]
[08:46] It's a little bit confusing.
[08:47] [typing sounds]
[08:51] "Has no exported member". Really? Because there it is, right there.
[08:58] Yeah, this is that problem JojoByte was investigating.
[09:04] [typing sounds]
[09:08] I'll come up with a better solution to this. It's just really annoying.
[09:11] [typing sounds]
[09:18] Okay.
[09:18] [typing sounds]
[09:26] All right, what if I just try this?
[09:28] [typing sounds]
[09:31] Nope.
[09:32] [typing sounds]
[09:35] How about this?
[09:36] [typing sounds]
[09:44] I just don't know...
[09:45] How am I supposed to...
[09:49] It's right here. "Dash keys".
[09:53] [typing sounds]
[09:57] "Encode key".
[09:58] [typing sounds]
[10:02] Whatever. Not worth messing with right now.
[10:04] [typing sounds]
[10:09] I'm just gonna ignore that and move on with my life.
[10:13] [typing sounds]
[10:16] Okay, well I was hoping to use the version from that, but I can't, so oh well.
[10:20] [typing sounds]
[10:25] So "CC" is "Private Key", "4C" is "Public Key". That's what I always get mixed up on.
[10:30] [typing sounds]
[10:33] So "CC" is "Private Key".
[10:34] [typing sounds]
[10:39] All right, so that's correct.
[10:40] [typing sounds]
[10:43] And the thing that I would want to do in addition or...
[10:46] Basically, very similar, but we're gonna do for "To Adder".
[10:51] [typing sounds]
[10:52] And this will be, of course, "PubBytes".
[10:54] [typing sounds]
[11:02] "Key" and "Address".
[11:05] [typing sounds]
[11:09] "As an Address".
[11:10] [typing sounds]
[11:11] "Derive Key", "Key".
[11:12] [typing sounds]
[11:16] "To Adder", "Public Key".
[11:20] [typing sounds]
[11:22] And then I'll just use this one right here as our example.
[11:29] [typing sounds]
[11:36] There we go.
[11:37] And then "Options", "B".
[11:40] [typing sounds]
[11:56] "Defaults", "Dash", "Private Key".
[12:01] [typing sounds]
[12:06] "Dash", "PubKey#".
[12:09] [typing sounds]
[12:22] All right, so I don't think there's anything else to this.
[12:25] [typing sounds]
[12:37] I need to make sure that there's always an "Await".
[12:39] [typing sounds]
[12:40] So I think it's going to kick my butt.
[12:42] [typing sounds]
[12:43] It's forgetting to put a "Wait" here.
[12:44] [typing sounds]
[12:54] Let me make sure all these examples have an "Await".
[12:57] [typing sounds]
[13:01] "From Seed Down".
[13:02] [typing sounds]
[13:04] All right, so...
[13:04] [typing sounds]
[13:07] "Await", "Await".
[13:08] [typing sounds]
[13:12] "Await".
[13:13] [typing sounds]
[13:17] "Await", "Await".
[13:19] [typing sounds]
[13:22] "Await".
[13:23] [typing sounds]
[13:25] "Await".
[13:25] Okay, good.
[13:26] Everything's got an "Await".
[13:27] [typing sounds]
[13:29] Everything that can have an "Await" does have an "Await".
[13:32] Okay, so now to "XProve".
[13:35] [typing sounds]
[13:36] This is probably going to be pretty similar.
[13:38] [typing sounds]
[13:43] Ooh, except that the version is of a different type on that one.
[13:47] [typing sounds]
[13:48] Ooh, hmm.
[13:50] I might have to rethink this.
[13:51] [typing sounds]
[13:53] We might have to provide "Version" as...
[13:57] [typing sounds]
[14:00] Hmm...
[14:01] [typing sounds]
[14:02] Something we do a two-string on.
[14:03] [typing sounds]
[14:07] Hmm...
[14:08] [typing sounds]
[14:10] So there's an inconsistency.
[14:11] [typing sounds]
[14:25] I like the idea of it being a string, but it may make more sense to be a number.
[14:30] In any case, I've got to make sure that it's consistent.
[14:36] And it'd be most easy to make it consistent by making it not a number here, but a string.
[14:42] [typing sounds]
[14:44] We have "Versions".
[14:45] [typing sounds]
[14:46] And we pass in "Version".
[14:48] [typing sounds]
[15:09] Because I think to XPRV...
[15:11] Oh, it does not currently take "Versions".
[15:14] [typing sounds]
[15:17] Oh, because that's already got "Versions" in it.
[15:18] Okay, great.
[15:20] [typing sounds]
[15:22] And that one, it's kind of abstract at this point.
[15:25] [typing sounds]
[15:28] Should be treated as an opaque value, maybe.
[15:31] [typing sounds]
[15:32] Would be the right way to say it.
[15:33] [typing sounds]
[15:35] Hey, how's it going?
[15:36] [typing sounds]
[15:37] Feel free to say hello.
[15:38] I'm a little bit tired.
[15:39] I just wanted to finish this up.
[15:40] [typing sounds]
[15:47] Okay, there's "To Adder", and that's "To Adder".
[15:50] So this one should be "To XPRV".
[15:51] [typing sounds]
[15:55] And this is going to take an "HDKey".
[15:57] [typing sounds]
[15:58] And that's all it's going to take.
[16:00] [typing sounds]
[16:29] [typing sounds]
[16:38] "Version XPRV or XPUB".
[16:45] [typing sounds]
[16:56] Okay, so we're going to show how we got that.
[16:58] And the way that we're going to get that is from...
[17:00] [typing sounds]
[17:03] "Use = -HD.Receive".
[17:09] [typing sounds]
[17:10] And then we're going to get "XKey" from "AwaitAccount.DriveXKey.Use".
[17:20] [typing sounds]
[17:22] And then...
[17:23] [typing sounds]
[17:26] Let "XPriv" equals "To XPRV XKey".
[17:37] [typing sounds]
[17:39] And then we can have this nice fellow here.
[17:44] [typing sounds]
[17:53] Alrighty. And likewise, we can have "XPUB".
[17:59] [typing sounds]
[18:02] To... Oh, whoops, we don't need that one yet.
[18:05] [typing sounds]
[18:07] And there are no options. Thank heavens.
[18:10] [typing sounds]
[18:12] No options, no beta.
[18:14] [typing sounds]
[18:19] Oh, and this one is where we actually need to perhaps specify
[18:24] the two different ways that we could get this.
[18:25] [typing sounds]
[18:29] Which would also be...
[18:30] [typing sounds]
[18:34] Let's say...
[18:35] [typing sounds]
[18:36] Or...
[18:37] [typing sounds]
[18:42] And this would be "-HD.From XKey XPRV".
[18:50] [typing sounds]
[18:53] That would also work.
[18:54] [typing sounds]
[18:58] I mean, I guess that's... That would be redundant.
[19:02] [typing sounds]
[19:03] But that would be appropriate.
[19:06] These are the two ways that you can get an XKey.
[19:09] [typing sounds]
[19:10] Is my mic still going?
[19:11] Okay, good.
[19:12] Because I noticed that the stream deck just disconnected.
[19:16] Daggone USB hubs.
[19:18] Why?
[19:19] [typing sounds]
[19:23] Okay.
[19:23] [typing sounds]
[19:24] So now we'll do the XPUB.
[19:26] [typing sounds]
[19:47] Okay.
[19:47] [typing sounds]
[19:49] And then...
[19:50] [typing sounds]
[19:52] Sure, we can derive the key.
[19:54] [typing sounds]
[19:55] Or we can go from an XPUB.
[19:57] [typing sounds]
[20:03] And we can go back.
[20:04] [typing sounds]
[20:24] All right, pull those two out of the way.
[20:26] [typing sounds]
[20:53] Put 32.
[21:01] [typing sounds]
[21:17] Okay.
[21:17] [typing sounds]
[21:28] Uh, this is the top level export.
[21:32] And these methods...
[21:36] Whoops.
[21:36] [typing sounds]
[21:40] And these methods are specific for the BIP44 use case.
[21:48] [typing sounds]
[22:03] Wallet.
[22:04] [typing sounds]
[22:06] Account.
[22:06] [typing sounds]
[22:11] XP.
[22:12] [typing sounds]
[22:36] Okay, there we go.
[22:37] [typing sounds]
[22:52] All right, the top level export also...
[22:55] [typing sounds]
[23:01] These are the more rudimentary functions.
[23:10] [typing sounds]
[23:15] Which can be used...
[23:17] [typing sounds]
[23:21] For either style of HD keys.
[23:26] [typing sounds]
[23:27] There we go, that's good.
[23:28] [typing sounds]
[23:30] All right, and then from here, I think I already had the create down here or something.
[23:35] No, I was doing types down there.
[23:37] Okay, so here...
[23:38] [typing sounds]
[23:47] Okay.
[23:47] [typing sounds]
[23:51] Create HD key.
[23:55] [typing sounds]
[24:00] Technically, the 2x, priv, xbub, and some of the other things go down here too, but whatever.
[24:04] These are the ones that I want to draw attention away from.
[24:07] [typing sounds]
[24:09] Typically, the BIP44...
[24:12] [typing sounds]
[24:16] These are useful for passing test vectors.
[24:26] [typing sounds]
[24:28] [typing sounds]
[24:54] These do not enforce BIP44 compliance.
[25:02] [typing sounds]
[25:03] There we go.
[25:04] [typing sounds]
[25:08] [sneezes]
[25:10] [typing sounds]
[25:15] And can be useful for testing and debugging.
[25:20] [typing sounds]
[25:36] All right, create.
[25:38] [typing sounds]
[25:48] Simply fills in an HD key...
[25:52] [typing sounds]
[26:00] ...with missing default values.
[26:02] [typing sounds]
[26:24] Oh, and I do want to change the types on that.
[26:36] Let's see here...
[26:40] Proven null, chain bytes, index...
[27:00] [typing sounds]
[27:12] Is there a reason that I don't put index on there?
[27:16] [typing sounds]
[27:26] Seems like that could be dangerous.
[27:36] [typing sounds]
[27:48] Okay, required, required, required, required.
[28:08] Let's see, what is this missing? Oh.
[28:18] What's wrong here?
[28:28] Okay, we've got a syntax error somewhere.
[28:38] No? Colon, colon, colon, colon, colon? All right, let's see what's up with this.
[28:58] That's weird. I don't know why...
[29:08] This is not happy with it. Seems like it should be.
[29:20] Well, something about it, it just can't figure out.
[29:34] [typing sounds]
[29:54] Okay, well...
[30:16] Http equals -http.create...
[30:44] Oh, and not like that. Uh-oh, what's going on here?
[30:52] Hold on, back the truck up, what happened?
[30:56] Ah, two back ticks, should have been three. There we go.
[31:02] All right, simply fills in an http key with any missing default values.
[31:10] Okay, now I think it's time to change, let's see, first of all, let's see what http key is defined as.
[31:14] Do we have http key defined anywhere?
[31:22] I think it's time to replace any http key with http key at this point.
[31:32] Actually, before I do that, let me make sure, is this clean? No, it's not. Not entirely.
[31:48] [typing sounds]
[32:04] To do. Okay.
[32:18] [typing sounds]
[32:38] Okay, so I'm going to replace http key with http key options.
[32:52] And I wanted to type this as kind of a pluck, but...
[33:06] Let's move this back in order of the way it actually gets serialized.
[33:18] Versions, version, depth, fingerprint, index. Let's go back here. Version, depth, fingerprint, index, chain, and then key.
[33:36] We're going to do the same thing here, we're just going to drop off a bunch of the documentation of it.
[33:42] I think it's more optional. So versions doesn't need to be defined.
[33:50] Number, so depth doesn't need to be defined.
[33:58] Parent fingerprint doesn't need to be defined.
[34:04] Well, I guess depth kind of should be defined, but I guess it doesn't have to be.
[34:17] Maybe index should have to be defined.
[34:31] Oh, there we go. Yeah.
[34:38] We could have an htp key. Let's see.
[34:49] I guess we technically could have the public keys out there.
[34:54] How do we do it with from seed?
[34:58] Is the public key done here? Do we drive?
[35:16] Okay, where do we call create?
[35:19] Or do we not anymore?
[35:25] Oh, we don't call it anymore. We could just get rid of it.
[35:32] I could be okay with that.
[35:36] Because there's not really much that it does.
[35:40] So, mix it?
[35:47] I'm going to comment it out for the time being.
[35:54] It's kind of, I mean, it's nice that it's there.
[35:59] Okay.
[36:02] Okay.
[36:05] Okay.
[36:34] Oops.
[36:49] Okay.
[37:17] Okay.
[37:31] There we go.
[37:58] Kind of want to say that should not be required.
[38:04] Okay, there we go.
[38:07] So, let me see about this though. Get status. Get diff cache. No. Get stash the whole thing.
[38:36] Okay.
[38:39] Okay.
[39:08] Okay.
[39:13] Okay. What is it upset about?
[39:18] Ah, yes.
[39:21] That's okay.
[39:24] That's acceptable.
[39:27] And then this one, likewise.
[39:31] The one below is acceptable.
[39:44] Okay, good.
[40:04] Okay, what's next?
[40:13] Returns an HD key with any missing values set to their default.
[40:40] Okay.
[40:49] Good, good, good.
[40:53] So, we got rid of create.
[41:08] Should be set if depth is set.
[41:25] All right, we got a couple more here.
[41:34] We got drive path, which is going to be HD key and HD path.
[41:42] And then we've got drive child, which is going to be HD key index is hardened.
[41:54] Okay.
[41:56] And that's all from that bunch.
[41:59] And this is just going to be pretty simple.
[42:04] Drive path. Let X key equals HD key equals and slash 0 slash 0 slash 1 slash 1.
[42:27] Can derive any valid BIP 32 path at any depth.
[42:52] Even if nonsensical, like having a hardened key after an unhardened one.
[43:21] Okay.
[43:49] Okay.
[43:57] Stick with child key.
[44:09] Let HD key.
[44:17] From seed.
[44:20] Seed bytes.
[44:49] Okay.
[45:02] Drive child.
[45:27] And this.
[45:52] Pass over an HD path.
[45:57] Calling.
[45:59] Drive child.
[46:02] For each.
[46:10] Number one.
[46:30] HD.
[46:45] Still do need to.
[46:57] Drive child should actually go first anyway.
[47:11] Performs.
[47:13] One.
[47:16] For each.
[47:38] This is the same as.
[47:55] Let's see.
[48:17] Okay. True false. True false. False.
[48:24] This is 0.
[48:27] 0.
[48:30] 1.
[48:33] 1.
[48:36] 0.
[49:05] Okay.
[49:07] There we go.
[49:13] Let's see.
[49:16] Derives one index.
[49:42] HD key.
[49:46] Index.
[49:51] Index value.
[49:53] Hardness.
[49:59] Okay.
[50:05] So we might do.
[50:09] HD key.
[50:15] Or X or X key.
[50:30] X key.
[50:45] And what would I call this one?
[50:49] Reducing undo.
[51:18] Okay.
[51:31] The 32 true.
[51:36] Oh, that's one thing I didn't need to mention, huh?
[51:41] HD.
[51:49] True.
[51:51] X key options.
[51:53] Okay, good.
[51:57] Okay.
[52:25] Okay.
[52:30] Next index is 42.
[52:33] Next index.
[52:38] Next.
[52:40] HD key.
[52:46] Okay.
[52:59] I think that's.
[53:01] That's the whole of the API, other than.
[53:05] The types, which there's only a few of and they're pretty easy to go over.
[53:09] And then I think I'm going to call it a night.
[53:11] And finish up the rest of the morning.
[53:15] So key types.
[53:28] Okay.
[53:32] Let's see from a wallet.
[53:54] The base HD key.
[54:00] Type with no special options.
[54:05] No additional methods.
[54:27] Used for BIP 44 addresses.
[54:33] And BIP 32 at any level.
[54:38] At any depth.
[54:53] Okay, let me think about this again.
[54:58] So this is one, two, three, four, and then five is the address.
[55:27] Okay.
[55:56] Okay.
[56:04] Same as all other HD keys.
[56:09] But with no additional methods.
[56:27] Okay.
[56:29] Let's see from a wallet.
[56:36] From an XPRIV.
[56:37] From an XPUB.
[56:43] Oh, no, I remember what I wanted to do here.
[56:54] Actually, both make sense.
[56:56] So we can do XPRIV.
[57:03] We can do derived key.
[57:07] And we can do XPUB.
[57:28] Okay.
[57:49] Where do I need to go here?
[57:51] HD key types.
[58:01] Hmm, let's see.
[58:21] Ah.
[58:48] Okay.
[59:04] Let's see.
[59:11] Let's try this again.
[59:26] Actually, C key.
[59:51] Same as key.
[59:55] But semantically.
[60:00] Different in that.
[60:03] All BIP 32.
[60:06] HD keys.
[60:09] Are.
[60:33] As key.
[60:39] But documented separately.
[60:44] As the semantics of.
[60:49] Since BIP 32.
[60:52] Doesn't define.
[60:54] The semantics.
[60:57] Of.
[61:00] HD keys.
[61:02] Doesn't define.
[61:05] Semantically.
[61:07] Different.
[61:11] A generic.
[61:13] HD key.
[61:17] The same structure.
[61:19] Structure.
[61:20] The same structure as key.
[61:21] But documented separately.
[61:26] Because BIP 32.
[61:28] Doesn't define.
[61:31] Semantic.
[61:34] Differences.
[61:37] Between.
[61:42] HD keys.
[61:44] At different.
[61:46] Depths.
[61:48] Other than the root.
[61:59] Okay, these are the old examples.
[62:09] Okay.
[62:11] So here we want to define key.
[62:16] So I kind of want to say this is going to be HD wallet.
[62:21] HD account.
[62:25] And HD something else.
[62:48] Let's see API.
[62:50] What do we call it here?
[62:52] Wallet account X key.
[62:55] Key HD key.
[63:00] Wallet account.
[63:02] X key.
[63:03] Key.
[63:13] Let's just call it HD key then.
[63:16] Doesn't define.
[63:34] Okay.
[63:52] Okay.
[64:21] All right.
[64:23] Fully derived BIP 44 address.
[64:31] I want to say.
[64:33] Depth equals 5.
[64:36] Depth 4.
[64:43] Depth 3.
[64:46] Depth 0.
[64:49] Through 2.
[64:55] There we go.
[64:56] That's good enough.
[65:09] Where's this depth?
[65:10] Is this considered depth 0 or depth 1?
[65:13] Depth 0.
[65:17] Okay.
[65:20] Hmm.
[65:49] Okay.
[66:02] So what do I need to, what more do I need to say about this thing?
[66:31] Okay.
[66:32] What's going on here?
[66:36] Uh-oh.
[66:37] What did I do?
[66:38] Okay.
[67:04] Ah, that's where I was.
[67:33] Okay.
[67:35] Okay.
[67:55] Okay.
[68:17] That's good.
[68:38] This can be shared.
[69:07] Typically used for sharing with a contact as a continual payment address.
[69:36] For, let's see.
[69:46] Used to generate near-infinite addresses between contacts.
[70:00] Okay.
[70:03] You share an XPub with a contact so that they can pay you again and pay you regularly without
[70:29] needing to request a new address each time.
[70:36] You share an XPub with an application so that it can pay on your behalf.
[70:52] Use the XPub sign to make payments on your behalf.
[71:10] There we go.
[71:12] This is actually valuable information.
[71:14] I'll have to repeat this in the morning.
[71:21] Share an XPub with a contact to be able to request
[71:43] so they can pay you repeatedly without needing...without sacrificing privacy and without needing a new
[72:12] address each time.
[72:17] So they can derive additional addresses to pay you repeatedly interaction from you to
[72:45] create a new address each time.
[72:47] There we go.
[72:48] Share an XPub with an application so that you can load the XPub side of it, and it can
[73:00] use the XPub side to make payments on your behalf.
[73:05] Yes, this is correct.
[73:07] And then what do we want to say here?
[73:33] Share an XPub.
[74:02] Share an XPub.
[74:09] Share an XPub.
[74:17] Share an XPub.
[74:25] An HD key with a derive key address index method.
[74:53] Share an XPub.
[74:58] Share an XPub.
[75:03] Share an XPub.
[75:23] Share an XPub.
[75:50] Share an XPub.
[76:10] Derive key address index method.
[76:38] Share an XPub.
[77:07] Share an XPub.
[77:09] Share an XPub.
[77:10] Share an XPub.
[77:11] A wallet.
[77:12] From an HD path.
[77:41] There we go.
[77:48] Dash HD dot derive path wallet, and then M4450.
[78:14] Let count index equal zero.
[78:42] All right.
[79:11] A root HD key.
[79:18] Ready to derive.
[79:25] From a seed.
[79:53] Derive count index method.
[80:01] Also derive 32 HD keys.
[80:26] Okay.
[80:42] Right here.
[80:57] To a different coin type.
[81:10] Okay.
[81:39] All right.
[81:40] Okay.
[81:49] Okay.
[82:18] Okay.
[82:20] To a different coin type.
[82:23] Or BIP32.
[82:26] Or non.
[82:28] Non BIP44 schema.
[82:41] Okay. Key types.
[83:00] Seeds are derived from word list. Wallets are calculated from a seed.
[83:18] Counts are derived.
[83:25] Coins.
[83:36] Purpose.
[83:39] Key.
[83:42] Wallet.
[83:44] Root keys are calculated from a seed.
[83:53] Purpose key is predefined.
[84:00] Use key.
[84:17] By index, X key is for sharing.
[84:33] Derived by use.
[84:39] Receiving or change.
[84:44] Key is for paying and getting paid.
[84:50] With or address.
[85:08] Wait, I'm still getting confused about this, aren't I?
[85:12] Okay.
[85:15] 34.44.
[85:17] Oh, that's coin type, right?
[85:24] Coin key.
[85:27] Five, four dash.
[85:56] Five, four dash.
[85:58] Five, four dash.
[86:23] Five, four dash.
[86:37] Let's see.
[87:05] Let me do it this way, actually.
[87:07] Depth zero.
[87:10] Wallet. Root key.
[87:12] Yeah, I like this, actually.
[87:15] Depth one.
[87:26] Two.
[87:37] Three.
[87:48] Depth four.
[88:09] Okay, and depth five.
[88:20] Not used by bit 44.
[88:45] Hmm.
[88:54] There we go.
[89:10] All right, I like that.
[89:39] Okay.
[89:50] Message.
[89:56] Okay.
[90:00] Uh-oh.
[90:05] Okay, so this was all -- this was all good.
[90:09] Derived child.
[90:12] Derived path. Okay.
[90:19] Keys can be derived by instance.
[90:41] Dash HD dot -- oh, whoops.
[90:58] Of course.
[91:00] What was I -- what was I -- token!
[91:29] Okay.
[91:51] Oh, whoops.
[92:16] Hmm. Let's see.
[92:19] HT key.
[92:30] That's another reason I don't like chaining, because it totally breaks
[92:34] single weight.
[93:03] Okay.
[93:10] Okay.
[93:23] There we go, that's what I wanted.
[93:46] Okay, I think that's good enough for now.
[93:54] I'll get back on this in the morning.
[94:09] Okay, what was I working on just before I -- oh, I was talking about the
[94:16] layers of depth.
[94:26] Wallet equals HD -- oops -- dash HD dot from seed, seed bytes.
[94:38] Let account equals wallet dot derive account.
[94:47] Account index, and this is, of course, going to be weight.
[94:53] Benefit of deriving by instance is that when you need to derive multiple
[95:13] keys from the same depth, e.g. -- let's see, what would it be?
[95:29] Addresses from the same X key.
[95:38] Or accounts from the same wallet.
[95:51] You're not deriving from the root each time.
[96:14] This is also referred to as wallet sometimes.
[96:43] Okay.
[97:03] Okay.
[97:25] Oops.
[97:54] Okay.
[98:00] BIP44HDPath.
[98:05] BIP44HDPath has five depths, each with their own HD key type.
[98:32] Zero -- well, I don't really want that.
[98:40] Zero, one, two, three, four, five.
[98:51] Okay.
[99:08] Let use equals dash HD dot receive.
[99:28] So that would be account, and that would be X key dot derive key.
[99:57] Okay.
[100:17.02] Recommended.
[100:46.02] Oops.
[101:14.02] Okay.
[101:16.02] Benefit of deriving by instance is that when you need to derive multiple keys in a loop,
[101:24.02] such as multiple keys from the same -- multiple keys from the same depth,
[101:46.02] you're not deriving time.
[101:53.02] Since the key derivation process is intentionally somewhat slow,
[102:07.02] pbkdf2.
[102:22.02] It's intentionally somewhat slow.
[102:31.02] It's best to loop at the lowest level that you can, for example.
[102:59.02] Okay.
[103:02.02] Let address equals zero.
[103:06.02] Address index less than 100.
[103:11.02] Address index plus equals one.
[103:15.02] Mm-hmm.
[103:25.02] Oh, whoops.
[103:50.02] Derive key should be address index.
[104:14.02] There we go.
[104:38.02] All right. Almost everything I know about HD keys is now embedded in this library.
[105:02.02] Oh, goody. And the glossary's still here.
[105:11.02] Cool.
[105:14.02] So I've got to put the glossary in there, too.
[105:17.02] Which that -- the function methods kind of actually do a good job on this one,
[105:22.02] because there's fair coverage across the use of the library,
[105:27.02] but I think that the glossary's still going to come in handy.
[105:31.02] So we did this. Huzzah.
[105:35.02] We did this. Huzzah.
[105:40.02] So update tests. Add glossary.
[106:09.02] All right. That's where I'm going to leave it at for now.
[106:21.02] I want to get that usage trimmed down to just a quick start.
[106:24.02] That's another thing for our to-dos.
[106:50.02] I wonder, maybe I could still -- I'm not sure what to do here.
[107:00.02] I'm going to try to get this.
[107:12.02] Okay.
[107:40.02] I think what I'm -- well, I don't want to put -- I want these to be linkable.
[107:49.02] I would like them to be linkable.
[108:10.02] I can get those linkable.
[108:13.02] But I wish I could get those linkable.
[108:16.02] I both want them to have a little bit of highlighting.
[108:24.02] I also probably need to put in here hardened, unhardened.
[108:30.02] But I don't know what to call unhardened, because I don't like unhardened as a name.
[108:34.02] It sounds too -- is it non-hardened, unhardened?
[108:54.02] Public.
[109:22.02] Okay.
[109:35.02] Let's try this.
[109:49.02] Publication types.
[109:52.02] Hardened.
[109:56.02] Equals true.
[109:59.02] Public equals false.
[110:19.02] Oh.
[110:37.02] Hardened derivation.
[110:45.02] False.
[110:53.02] Or public derivation.
[111:21.02] Such a better name. Glad I saw that in the spec.
[111:36.02] Hardened public.
[112:02.02] Okay. The hardened --
[112:12.02] Or the index key should be derived with a hardened.
[112:30.02] Public.
[112:53.02] Public.
[113:05.02] Hardened equals true.
[113:09.02] Public equals false.
[113:16.02] Okay, good. And these still look right.
[113:19.02] We still have XRZ, bulk, BC9, 5SHC, bits.
[113:36.02] 5SHC, bits, bulk, BC9. Cool.
[113:43.02] I hope I didn't accidentally swappy-doodle anything, you know?
[113:57.02] Okay, this is good.
[114:00.02] This is good.
[114:06.02] Oh, my heavens.
[114:09.02] All right.
[114:11.02] I'm out.
[114:13.02] Have a good one.
[114:14.02] Good night.
[114:15.02] Adios.
