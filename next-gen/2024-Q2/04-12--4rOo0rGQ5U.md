## Transcript

[00:00] I'm missing something.
[00:06] Where did my browser windows go?
[00:10] Um, and why is this going so slow?
[00:13] Hold on here.
[00:14] Get rid of this one.
[00:16] Get rid of that.
[00:18] Do the thing.
[00:20] Okay.
[00:21] And so, let's see, I still want to listen to something, so I think I might listen to
[00:40] something.
[00:41] Okay.
[00:42] Great.
[00:43] Let me find out where my browser window went that had all of my dash stuff in it.
[00:57] Should have been right here.
[00:58] Sometimes the browser windows relocate themselves because reasons, and sometimes that happens.
[01:04] That's really weird.
[01:05] Okay.
[01:06] I'm not touching the computer.
[01:10] What is going on?
[01:11] Ah, it might be time for a reboot.
[01:14] You know Max these days.
[01:17] The future ain't what it used to be, let me tell ya.
[01:26] The future just ain't what it used to be.
[01:45] Okay, um, where did my dash window go?
[01:59] I've got to find it.
[02:05] Is this it?
[02:06] Oh, I might have moved it myself because I was doing stuff off screen and I was taking
[02:11] up real estate in a different way.
[02:14] Alrighty.
[02:15] So, let me give a recap here on especially the good news.
[02:27] Oh, whoops.
[02:36] Where is my window?
[02:38] There it is.
[02:39] Alright.
[02:41] So, I've got master messages going back and forth.
[02:44] The P2P messages, P2P control messages.
[02:50] And I'm pretty sure that all messages have the same header.
[02:57] And I think I, you know, just, just while I was sitting here thinking on it, or maybe
[03:02] it was early, I don't know, the idea came to me of how to handle the messages in a way
[03:07] that feels both the JavaScripty and, try to keep it simple.
[03:18] So, if we send one, if we send one message, we may get multiple in return.
[03:25] Depending on the setup, it's also possible that we get messages that we did not know
[03:29] we were asking for.
[03:32] So what I want to do is basically abstract lightly, ever so lightly, just the, the message
[03:43] so that we are looking not at network packets.
[03:48] We don't want to be working at the network layer.
[03:50] We want to be working at the message layer.
[03:53] And so that's what I'm going to start working with.
[03:57] And then the packet parsers, we do need to review them because there are some nuanced
[04:02] details that, that need a bit of a, of a careful eye to them.
[04:11] But I think for what we're doing, it's going to end up being pretty simple.
[04:15] I think it's going to end up being just mostly the, the, the header message.
[04:24] And I don't think there's going to be, well, we'll see, we'll see.
[04:26] I don't know what all the messages are, but I, I've got to, I know how they're, they're
[04:33] produced and some stuff about them.
[04:34] So we'll just go ahead and go, there we are.
[04:41] And then I'm going to be listening to, uh, probably some murder mystery or something
[04:47] in here.
[04:48] Oh, and I, there's one other thing that I need to do real quick.
[04:51] Hold on.
[04:52] I forgot about, let's see, do, do, do, do, do.
[05:14] Just one second, we'll get to it.
[05:38] Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold
[06:06] on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[06:16] Just sorry.
[06:17] One more minute here.
[06:18] Uh.
[06:19] I'm going to be listening to, uh, some of the messages that are coming in.
[06:47] Sorry, one, 30 more seconds.
[07:13] Why is this giving me?
[07:43] Why is this giving me grief?
[07:49] Oh, it's.
[07:58] I need to update a meetup title.
[08:08] And it's not letting me update the title.
[08:13] Okay, um, cause there's a meetup tonight that I--okay, it looks like it, okay, it was giving
[08:22] me a false error.
[08:23] It actually updated the title.
[08:27] Okay, sorry, sorry for that, uh, wasted, uh, three minutes there.
[08:43] But now, okay, we're off to the races.
[09:03] Okay.
[09:29] So, uh, yeah.
[09:30] I've got all the messages.
[09:31] I've got, I've got the, the bit of how to do the messages and I'm going to make this
[09:38] a little bit better.
[09:39] I'm also maybe, uh, why is my computer acting so strangely?
[09:47] It's freaking out.
[09:49] Um, come on, come on, computer.
[09:56] Work naturally.
[09:58] Don't give me shenanigans.
[10:00] I, yeah, my computer is going bonkers right now.
[10:03] I don't know what is going on, but it is like windows are flipping back and forth between
[10:08] screens.
[10:09] Um, yeah, something, something strange is going on.
[10:21] Okay.
[10:47] All right.
[10:48] I'm good.
[10:49] I'm good.
[10:50] I'm good.
[10:51] I can actually get started.
[10:52] Uh, I am listening to something, but yeah, feel free to ask questions and then I'll turn
[11:00] that off and be more lively.
[11:05] The first part I'm going to do is just a little bit of a refactor on this.
[11:10] So I have a read header function and I'm going to make it read a message instead so that
[11:15] it reads the whole payload and then I'm going to put those messages into a queue so that
[11:22] I can review them at my leisure.
[11:24] Because like I said, the messages are not all, it's not a request response style.
[11:30] I can be getting a message while I'm sending another message or, uh, yeah, there's, there's,
[11:38] there's a little bit of a synchrony to the messages and so I just want to have a read
[11:41] messages in a loop kind of go funk style.
[11:47] And then, yeah, actually this, this would be perfect.
[11:49] This would be a perfect channel if we were doing go is we would, we would select on a
[11:53] channel on this and JavaScript.
[11:55] It's a little bit different, but that's essentially what we're going to be doing.
[11:59] So we're going to have read message, whoops, and then we're going to read the payload without
[12:10] decoding the payload yet.
[12:13] Look for the message.
[12:14] That's the payload that we want and, and continue on.
[12:20] Okay.
[12:23] Oh, okay.
[12:27] Good.
[12:28] Is soundboards working?
[12:29] Okay.
[12:30] Good.
[12:31] Soundboard's working.
[12:52] (gentle music)
[12:55] (gentle music)
[12:58] (gentle music)
[13:00] (gentle music)
[13:03] (gentle music)
[13:22] (gentle music)
[13:25] - Okay, this is gonna be a weird
[13:39] and I don't want it to be difficult to read or understand.
[13:41] So I may update it later,
[13:43] but for right now, this is what I'm gonna do.
[13:47] (gentle music)
[13:49] (gentle music)
[13:52] This is not the weird part yet.
[14:02] (gentle music)
[14:05] (gentle music)
[14:07] (gentle music)
[14:11] (gentle music)
[14:13] (gentle music)
[14:16] (gentle music)
[14:19] (gentle music)
[14:22] (gentle music)
[14:26] (gentle music)
[14:30] (gentle music)
[14:45] (gentle music)
[14:47] (gentle music)
[15:03] (gentle music)
[15:08] (gentle music)
[15:14] (gentle music)
[15:17] I'm not actually listening to a podcast.
[15:42] I'm, that's just the message I put up,
[15:46] but I'm listening to fish keeping answers.
[15:49] There's a number of YouTube videos I've got in my,
[15:55] my reserve or not reserve,
[16:00] but my watch/listen list.
[16:03] And so I'm listening to something about fish.
[16:05] (gentle music)
[16:09] (gentle music)
[16:12] Do you like my GoFunk here?
[16:20] (gentle music)
[16:23] This is my, here's my channels.
[16:27] (gentle music)
[16:29] (gentle music)
[16:32] If I squint real hard,
[17:00] yeah, see, I got my channel buffer.
[17:04] I've got my GoFunk.
[17:06] I call my GoFunk,
[17:08] and then I'm going to put things in the channel.
[17:10] (gentle music)
[17:12] The JavaScript fades into the background.
[17:23] (laughs)
[17:24] Yeah.
[17:25] (gentle music)
[17:28] (gentle music)
[17:30] How have you been, by the way?
[17:49] (gentle music)
[17:52] (gentle music)
[17:55] Okay.
[18:07] (gentle music)
[18:09] (gentle music)
[18:12] Hmm.
[18:26] (gentle music)
[18:29] (gentle music)
[18:32] Sorry.
[18:50] (gentle music)
[18:53] There's my read message.
[18:54] I'm going to bring that back up.
[18:55] (gentle music)
[18:58] (gentle music)
[19:00] Okay, where'd my header go?
[19:07] Header is here.
[19:09] (gentle music)
[19:11] So actually the other mess,
[19:15] the other one might already be better.
[19:17] (gentle music)
[19:20] Let's see.
[19:21] (gentle music)
[19:23] (gentle music)
[19:26] Okay, that's the connect.
[19:32] (gentle music)
[19:35] (gentle music)
[19:37] (gentle music)
[19:40] the other one.
[19:41] (gentle music)
[19:43] (gentle music)
[19:46] (coughs)
[20:11] (gentle music)
[20:14] (gentle music)
[20:16] (gentle music)
[20:19] (gentle music)
[20:22] (gentle music)
[20:25] (gentle music)
[20:31] (gentle music)
[20:38] (gentle music)
[20:41] Okay.
[20:56] (gentle music)
[21:00] So the reason I'm using data here,
[21:05] 'cause I was using readable,
[21:06] 'cause I went on that rant about how,
[21:08] hey, don't ever use data.
[21:10] You should always use readable.
[21:11] The reason that I'm using data here
[21:13] is simply because that the exact reason
[21:18] I mentioned the other day.
[21:19] If you have,
[21:20] if you want to be able to have multiple listeners,
[21:24] unfortunately readable will not give you multiple,
[21:34] you cannot have multiple listeners with readable
[21:37] because once the data is consumed, it is consumed.
[21:40] Dash coin.
[21:46] So CoinJoin for Dash.
[21:48] Dash is a cryptocurrency.
[21:51] And I am a firm believer
[21:56] that almost all cryptocurrencies are absolute scam garbage.
[21:59] So just so we're on the same page there.
[22:03] I don't think cryptocurrencies are cool.
[22:04] I don't think they're going to save the world.
[22:07] I think that they're that very, very few of them,
[22:11] almost none of them.
[22:13] And certainly none of the ones that you've ever heard of.
[22:15] Good, you'll stay then.
[22:18] Certainly none of the ones that you've ever heard of
[22:21] actually are trying to solve a money exchange problem.
[22:25] And Dash is one of those.
[22:26] And you've probably never heard of it
[22:28] because it doesn't have big investor money
[22:31] and yada, yada, yada.
[22:33] It's not a marketing scam.
[22:35] They're not selling tulips to people.
[22:38] It is the people who are thinking around technology,
[22:42] trying to solve difficult problems
[22:47] and starting with a fork of other cryptocurrency technology
[22:53] and trying to improve it to the point
[22:55] that it actually accomplishes some of the original goals
[22:58] before it all became a hype train of investor scamminess.
[23:01] So anyway, yeah.
[23:05] And I'm also listening to something right now.
[23:08] I actually just paused it.
[23:09] But if you ask questions or engage,
[23:11] I'll pause when I'm listening to.
[23:12] But yeah, right now all I'm doing
[23:15] is moving some functions around
[23:17] so that I can get a better flow for this
[23:24] because it's its own network protocol
[23:28] that is not, it's based on TCP,
[23:33] but it's not dependent on TCP.
[23:36] But it's not based on HTTP.
[23:38] So all of the layering of how to make decisions
[23:41] of types and da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
[23:45] Unfortunately, all that goes out the window
[23:48] and starts over from scratch.
[23:52] So.
[23:53] Yeah, I think basically anyone over 13
[24:07] is a little too old for crypto hype at this point.
[24:09] Yeah, it's cryptocurrency hype.
[24:13] I think we need more crypto as in cryptography hype,
[24:17] but yeah, a lot less cryptocurrency hype.
[24:19] But then again, then I wouldn't have this job
[24:22] and so, yeah.
[24:25] Take the good with the bad, I guess.
[24:27] UDP is an alternative to TCP.
[24:30] UDP is a, it's the datagram protocol.
[24:33] Basically it's stateless.
[24:35] So you just send messages and you hope that they get there.
[24:38] And it's really useful for things like video streams
[24:41] where if you skip a couple of frames,
[24:44] you don't actually want to resend
[24:46] to get the previous frames.
[24:48] So UDP is used in most video conferencing formats,
[24:53] most video conferencing software.
[24:56] You do not want to waste any of your bandwidth
[25:02] retransmitting or receiving old data.
[25:06] So TCP is a guaranteed delivery mechanism.
[25:09] It has stuff at the protocol layer.
[25:11] Oh, okay, okay.
[25:12] You put the question with UDP and so that's why.
[25:16] Okay.
[25:18] Yeah.
[25:19] So anyway.
[25:25] Yeah, I'm trying to very lightly abstract this
[25:33] just so that we can look at it from a perspective
[25:35] of complete messages rather than packets.
[25:39] That's my goal right now with the changes I'm making.
[25:46] Now that I understand the packet structure
[25:48] and I've got one packet working
[25:49] and I need to start working on other packets,
[25:51] it's like I'm starting to copy and paste this code around
[25:55] and it's quite a bit of code and it's easy to,
[25:57] I already had a bug because I failed to
[26:00] change the length here.
[26:04] So I should probably have some sort of constant.
[26:08] Header size equals 24.
[26:13] That way that magic number of 24 isn't hanging around
[26:16] for some other developer to wonder
[26:19] what the heck does 24 mean?
[26:21] It means header size.
[26:24] 'Cause the header size is a static size
[26:27] and the payload size is a variable size.
[26:30] So, which is good.
[26:31] That's the way it should be, ideally.
[26:34] (soft music)
[26:36] Also a goal that I have here is that right now,
[26:51] well, if you know the history of some of the transition
[26:58] between TLS 1.1, 1.2, 1.3,
[27:02] one of the things with 1.3 was to make explicit
[27:07] a shortcut that you could make with 1.2.
[27:12] You could send the hello signal
[27:14] and the acknowledgement signal at the same time.
[27:18] This actually has the same problem as TLS 1.2.
[27:21] It requires you to
[27:24] to receive an acknowledgement before you can start speaking
[27:32] but the reality is the acknowledgement
[27:35] is probably gonna happen.
[27:36] So, what I want to make sure is that the way
[27:39] that I'm coding this in the future
[27:42] or right now, if something sends the acknowledgement
[27:48] before I've sent my request,
[27:53] it should just parse it and receive it
[27:57] and be able to handle it.
[27:59] So, the protocol has to be satisfied.
[28:01] We both have to send a hello
[28:03] and we both have to send an acknowledgement
[28:07] but it's perfectly reasonable for me to send my hello
[28:12] and my acknowledgement at the same time,
[28:15] assuming that the other person's hello is coming
[28:19] and that their acknowledgement is coming.
[28:22] I should just be able to go ahead and get started,
[28:25] not send my message, wait for the response,
[28:28] send my acknowledgement, wait for the response
[28:31] and they kind of mimic TCP on top of whatever protocol
[28:34] because I think that originally this was thought
[28:39] that it would run on Onion
[28:41] or it'd run on these secret peer-to-peer networks
[28:44] and it would be encapsulated
[28:45] and I don't think any of that's actually happening
[28:48] but the message structure has a lot
[28:51] of extra bogus information that you don't need
[28:53] if you just say you're using TCP
[28:55] and that your socket is sufficient.
[29:00] So, for example, it re-encodes the addresses again
[29:03] and some other stuff.
[29:05] So, there's a little bit of overhead
[29:07] that's not actually needed
[29:10] and if you know that you're relying on TCP,
[29:12] you can just kind of skip over some of that stuff.
[29:15] Man, I wish I was over 13 and under 20.
[29:20] Oh, to be a teenager again.
[29:23] You had no idea about TLS.
[29:29] Oh, you're breaking my C-brain.
[29:30] How am I breaking your C-brain?
[29:32] Okay.
[29:44] (gentle music)
[29:46] (computer beeping)
[30:14] Because you're doing threading
[30:17] with what you're about to do.
[30:20] Yeah, JavaScript, you just did the threading happens
[30:25] in the background, so yeah, don't gotta worry about it.
[30:28] Okay.
[30:30] So, anyway, I was talking about some of these to-dos
[30:36] are just related to when I have this fully working,
[30:39] all of the data events are gonna go away
[30:43] and then I'm gonna put it back to readable events
[30:45] 'cause readable events are more efficient in several ways,
[30:50] but they have the drawback of,
[30:54] you can't have multiple listeners on a readable event
[30:57] once the data is consumed from a readable event,
[30:59] it's consumed for all listeners
[31:01] and there might be a way to get around that,
[31:02] but I looked it up recently and I didn't find it.
[31:07] So, anyway, all right, this one is,
[31:12] is this my new read message or my old read message?
[31:14] Dang it, I should probably have just gotten rid
[31:16] of that thing.
[31:17] Okay, there was this, but then there was this.
[31:31] Is this the one?
[31:32] No, that's, okay, this is the right one, all right.
[31:36] So, we've got the cleanup there on readable header.
[31:42] Okay, we're debugging the header,
[31:44] we're moving the listener, setting the payload listener.
[31:48] So, the only thing I need to do here is not parse it.
[31:51] If I don't parse it and I just do header.payload equals
[31:56] a chunk, then that's good enough.
[32:02] Then I can do,
[32:09] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[32:14] Let's see.
[32:15] I'm gonna just resolve header at that point.
[32:25] And I don't need that.
[32:38] Bless my.
[32:39] And then I could do, I think I'm gonna do it this way.
[32:52] I think I'm gonna create a listeners map
[32:56] and then I can do listeners equals object.values,
[33:06] listeners map, then I don't have a guaranteed order.
[33:10] That's fine, I don't need one.
[33:12] But then I can make my own key as to,
[33:23] you know, what I've got going on there.
[33:26] And then, let's see if this will work.
[33:33] So I do that, so then I can await new promise.
[33:38] Yeah, one thing that we never got figured out
[33:42] in JavaScript, unfortunately,
[33:44] with many things that we did finally get figured out,
[33:47] was, okay, listener map version.
[33:55] Okay, listener map version equals function.
[34:00] And this actually should be parse version.
[34:13] We don't need to parse verac because there's no,
[34:18] there's nothing to do about it.
[34:23] (soft music)
[34:26] So we probably can go ahead and send both.
[34:35] I'm gonna try sending both the version
[34:37] and the version acknowledgement at the same time.
[34:40] I just wanna see, first I'll try doing it
[34:44] in the correct order once I've got
[34:45] this little bit of code updated,
[34:47] but then I'm gonna try just sending,
[34:49] I'm gonna try sending all three at the same time.
[34:51] I'm gonna try sending the version,
[34:53] the acknowledgement, and the request.
[34:57] Because I don't actually need to wait for,
[35:02] you know, I don't need to wait for any of that stuff
[35:04] in order to get the work to get done.
[35:07] (soft music)
[35:36] It would be really interesting to test
[35:38] and see how robust their software implementation is,
[35:41] which I will do at some point, but I won't do right now.
[35:44] But to send it all together,
[35:48] because not to send it as here's a message,
[35:51] here's a message, here's a message,
[35:53] 'cause all of these are gonna fit into,
[35:56] we could fit all three messages into a single TCP packet.
[35:59] And I think it would be really interesting
[36:02] to see if their software is robust
[36:05] in the sense of parsing out the packets
[36:08] and handling them appropriately.
[36:09] 'Cause if it does it correctly,
[36:11] then what it will do is it will parse out the data,
[36:14] it will read the data that it needs,
[36:16] it'll read the header, it'll read the data that it needs,
[36:18] it will call the function that handles the version thing,
[36:23] which will then send out the version.
[36:28] So as far as it's concerned,
[36:30] it received a version and sent a version,
[36:32] then the reader will resume,
[36:36] and as the reader resumes from the bytes
[36:39] that it already received, it'll have the acknowledgement,
[36:42] even though I haven't received the version yet.
[36:47] So it'll parse that and then it will send its acknowledgement
[36:50] and then it'll follow,
[36:55] and then it will continue from its reader,
[36:57] and then it will have my request,
[37:02] and then it will send the response.
[37:04] So we could drop the round-trip time down significantly
[37:08] in doing that, and so I'm interested to see how that works.
[37:12] I also want to make sure
[37:16] that I have in my little doodad here,
[37:19] let's make sure that we have console.log message.command.
[37:26] Message.command.
[37:28] 'Cause if it doesn't work, that's a bug,
[37:40] and it's a small enough ecosystem that that could be solved.
[37:43] But yeah, lying about acknowledgements,
[37:52] it is the right thing to do in networking.
[37:55] I don't understand the circumstances
[37:57] under which someone would wait for an acknowledgement,
[38:02] but that doesn't really seem to make sense.
[38:06] I mean, it's good to know that it happened at some point,
[38:13] but yeah.
[38:15] We'll send it all at once, and it's gonna be awesome.
[38:23] Okay, and the previous iteration of the code
[38:27] was not as resilient to this,
[38:29] but this is one of those things with networking
[38:31] that you just don't want to have to deal with it later,
[38:35] and it's not that much trouble to deal with
[38:36] at the beginning, especially in this case
[38:38] where we don't actually have to sit in a receive loop,
[38:42] because one thing I'm not,
[38:44] here's the case that I'm not handling.
[38:48] I'm not handling the slow loris attack,
[38:51] where you send one byte at a time,
[38:54] and wait the time out, send a byte,
[38:56] wait the time out, send a byte, wait the byte, send a,
[38:58] I'm not handling that.
[39:00] So your message must be at least 24 bytes long,
[39:04] and your message must include a payload size.
[39:07] And then I should, I do need to actually,
[39:11] let's see, where is it gonna be?
[39:20] Okay, payload size.
[39:23] And there's probably some other stuff we need to do
[39:26] to protect against maliciousness, but okay.
[39:30] So right here, before we call this one, right around here,
[39:35] so if header.payloadSize is greater than,
[39:40] I forget what the size is.
[39:45] (soft music)
[39:48] So payloadSizeMax.
[40:01] And the payloadSizeMax in our case,
[40:08] we probably cap it around a megabyte or so.
[40:10] The actual max is pretty darn big,
[40:15] but we don't need the actual max.
[40:17] (soft music)
[40:21] We could, let's say four megabytes just to be generous.
[40:34] Whoops, that was three, let's go four.
[40:39] But yeah, message sizes should be relatively small.
[40:45] (soft music)

[44:02] (soft music)
[44:05] (soft music)
[44:08] (soft music)
[44:11] I may actually want to do this promise in a different way.
[44:17] (soft music)
[44:21] I'll have to think on that.
[44:28] Not a big difference,
[44:30] just I may want to get the promise object first
[44:34] and then be able to call the resolve and reject
[44:37] rather than have them encapsulated in.
[44:40] (soft music)
[44:44] (soft music)
[44:46] (soft music)
[44:51] (soft music)
[44:59] (soft music)
[45:05] (soft music)
[45:12] (soft music)
[45:15] (soft music)
[45:30] Okay.
[45:38] (soft music)
[45:42] (soft music)
[45:44] Oh, oops, not async, oh wait.
[45:54] (soft music)
[45:57] (soft music)
[46:07] (soft music)
[46:09] Okay.
[46:30] (soft music)
[46:33] (soft music)
[46:36] Hmm.
[46:57] (soft music)
[47:01] (soft music)
[47:03] Okay, I think this...
[47:28] (soft music)
[47:30] (soft music)
[47:33] (soft music)
[47:35] (soft music)
[47:38] (soft music)
[47:41] (soft music)
[47:51] (soft music)
[47:53] (soft music)
[48:03] (soft music)
[48:09] (soft music)
[48:12] All right, so...
[48:35] (soft music)
[48:39] (soft music)
[48:41] And before the version parser wasn't implemented
[48:45] and that kind of makes sense
[48:46] because it's not necessary for our use case.
[48:50] We can ignore the version message.
[48:51] However, having a version parser
[48:56] puts us in a good position for tests and debugging
[48:59] because without a version parser,
[49:02] we can't parse our version message
[49:05] to make sure that it looks the way
[49:07] that we expected it to look.
[49:09] So I did implement the version parser
[49:13] and then I've tested it here to make sure that...
[49:17] It's working as I would expect.
[49:23] Okay, so this is where...
[49:30] (soft music)
[49:34] (soft music)
[49:37] I'm expecting...
[49:43] I'll put this down below for now
[49:45] 'cause we need to test it first.
[49:47] But I'm expecting that we're gonna be able
[49:49] to write the version, the acknowledgement,
[49:53] and the query all in one go.
[50:01] And as long as they haven't done anything...
[50:06] super shortcutty on their side,
[50:10] which in C it's kind of hard to write network socket code
[50:14] in a shortcut way.
[50:16] So I'm suspecting that it's probably...
[50:21] gonna work out.
[50:29] Okay, so...
[50:31] (soft music)
[50:33] So let's just do this first.
[50:42] So we send our version message,
[50:45] we wait for their version message.
[50:48] We see send our version acknowledgement,
[50:52] and then they will send their version acknowledgement.
[50:58] That's the idea of how this is gonna work.
[51:01] So this will resolve,
[51:03] and then this will resolve,
[51:06] and I do need some way to clean up messages
[51:08] that have been read, that have been handled.
[51:12] But this should allow us to...
[51:17] ignore the messages that we don't want,
[51:22] and just listen for the messages that we do want.
[51:27] And in particular, if I do it this way...
[51:30] Yeah.
[51:35] And we just do a little bit of cleanup here.
[51:39] And do the cleanup here as well.
[51:55] Oh, and I guess I could simplify that to just be...
[51:59] Nah.
[52:01] We'll get there, we'll figure it out.
[52:06] (soft music)
[52:08] (soft music)
[52:10] (soft music)
[52:12] (soft music)

[52:46] (soft music)
[52:49] (soft music)
[52:52] (soft music)
[52:55] (soft music)
[52:58] Right.
[53:01] So that, we don't need to do that anymore.
[53:04] We can get rid of that now.
[53:06] (soft music)
[53:10] (soft music)
[53:12] (soft music)

[55:03] (soft music)
[55:06] (soft music)
[55:08] (soft music)
[55:11] (soft music)
[55:14] There's our payload.
[55:17] (soft music)
[55:20] (soft music)
[55:22] There's their header back.
[55:25] And why did we fail on this?

[56:12] (soft music)
[56:15] (soft music)
[56:18] (soft music)
[56:21] Okay.
[56:24] (soft music)
[56:27] Hmm.
[56:30] (soft music)
[56:33] Message.
[56:35] (soft music)
[56:38] (soft music)
[56:41] (soft music)
[56:44] (soft music)
[56:47] (soft music)
[56:50] (soft music)
[56:53] (soft music)
[56:56] (soft music)
[56:59] I don't understand.
[57:02] (soft music)
[57:04] (soft music)
[57:07] (soft music)
[57:10] (soft music)
[57:13] (soft music)
[57:16] Undefined.
[57:19] That doesn't seem likely.
[57:22] (soft music)
[57:25] (soft music)
[57:28] Okay.
[57:31] (soft music)
[57:33] (soft music)
[57:36] (soft music)
[57:39] (soft music)
[57:42] Okay. I'm a little confused.
[57:45] A little confused.
[57:48] Because...
[57:51] There's the resolve. It resolves the data.
[57:54] So let me go back up here.
[57:58] Read message should definitely have a message.
[58:00] (soft music)
[58:03] (soft music)
[58:06] And this is just something silly is going on.
[58:09] That's all that this is.
[58:12] So read message. There's the resolve to the promise.
[58:15] (soft music)
[58:18] Ah!
[58:21] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[58:24] Okay.
[58:27] Because we've got a double promise thing going on here.
[58:29] A promise to the promise.
[58:32] So this is where it might be better
[58:35] if I were to take this.
[58:38] So I could take this and I could do...
[58:41] I think this would be simpler.
[58:44] I think I'm going to go with it.
[58:47] So we do this.
[58:50] (soft music)
[58:53] And we...
[58:56] (soft music)
[58:58] Get it?
[59:01] (soft music)

[62:51] (soft music)
[62:54] You can't make a TCP connection in the browser.
[62:56] I think using something like libp2p is just plain stupid because then you're passing a
[63:00] message around the whole internet and doing, you know, you're just doing a bunch of gymnastics
[63:05] for something that's very simple and easy to do, right?
[63:08] And there's already signatures in these messages.
[63:12] So if you just, you know, first of all, you pass to a server that you trust, just like
[63:17] with Insight, right?
[63:18] So we stand up a server.
[63:20] It's a server that we trust.
[63:22] You can, anybody can run the server.
[63:23] They can run their own server.
[63:24] They can run alongside a full node.
[63:26] Every master node should run this program.
[63:28] That's the bottom line.
[63:30] Every single master node should be running the suite of tools that are necessary for
[63:35] the web platform.
[63:38] So anyway, so, you know, pick your master node, connect to it.
[63:41] That's the ideal.
[63:42] That's what it should be when we get there.
[63:45] In the interim, doesn't matter, set up a server anywhere.
[63:48] It just connects to the master node and then transmits the packets back and forth and relays
[63:53] them.
[63:55] And you, you have the ability to verify the signatures even in the browser.
[64:02] So if, if somehow, which in this case it doesn't even matter because it's CoinJoin, but if
[64:07] somehow the, you know, the server that you trusted were to become malicious, it doesn't
[64:11] matter because you still can verify the signatures if you need to.
[64:17] But yes, this, this will run in the browser.
[64:20] Not all, some of the components must exist elsewhere, but the, the, all of the message,
[64:30] all of the, the, the, the messages and everything can be constructed in the browser, passed
[64:35] via HTTP to a proxy server, and then passed to a master node.
[64:40] And if, if things are done right, then the master nodes will just expose this as part
[64:46] of their, you know, dash mate setup.
[64:48] That's, that's, that's where this needs to go, um, you know, ultimately.
[64:54] So, okay, why, what is going on?
[65:01] Parse Verak.
[65:04] Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[65:14] Okay.
[65:15] So what we're going to do is we're going to say that this is bytes.
[65:25] We're going to do buffer dot from bytes, let buffer equals, and this will be taken out.
[65:35] This is just for debugging purposes, because it's a little bit easier than the other tools,
[65:39] so that that'll be taken out.
[65:48] Let's run this again.
[65:52] See what we get.
[66:08] I may take that out of the loop or getting this a little bit further.
[66:13] Okay.
[66:14] Readable payload, read message, and payload is in there.
[66:18] Great.
[66:19] So this one, the payload's in there, commands there, but message dot command, invalid archetype,
[66:25] uh, receive instance of object.
[66:27] Okay.
[66:28] Okay.
[66:29] I think I understand what's going on.
[66:34] So this is going to be dev RPC 307.
[66:38] I think I'm passing in the wrong object.
[66:39] I think it should be passing in, whoops, let's try it again, 307, uh, should be passing in
[66:46] message dot payload was passing in message.
[66:52] Now I think this is going to get, um, where it's supposed to be, right?
[66:59] Chunk byte length.
[67:00] Okay.
[67:01] We need to go check that.
[67:02] I kind of know why that is.
[67:08] Okay.
[67:09] Yeah.
[67:10] I think I know exactly what that problem is.
[67:12] Nope.
[67:15] Chunks zero.
[67:18] So on payload, if not chunk, console dot warn.
[67:36] Okay.
[67:58] Okay.
[68:15] What happened?
[68:37] What did I do?
[68:40] What great sin have I committed?
[68:43] Okay.
[68:49] Unexpected token.
[68:50] Oh, there we go.
[68:51] Okay.
[68:52] So I'm going to go ahead and run this again.
[68:53] Okay.

[72:15] Adder messages.

[72:27] Adder V2 messages.
[72:30] Adder V2 messages.
[72:33] Adder V2 messages.
[72:36] Adder V2 messages.
[72:39] Adder V2 messages.
[72:42] Adder V2 messages.
[72:45] Adder V2 messages.
[72:48] This is conspiracy level garbage.
[72:51] Prevent anyone from trying to use the network to disrupt non-DASH services that run on other ports.
[72:57] No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
[73:01] No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
[73:03] That, like, the...
[73:05] It should just run on whatever port it says.
[73:09] And this is also false in that it's not a last resort.
[73:14] It doesn't work.
[73:16] Well, depending on which layer of the application.
[73:19] I've not worked in the part of the application that handles this message.
[73:23] But I know that other parts of the application do not.
[73:26] They purposefully and intentionally drop support.
[73:32] Because there might be good reasons.
[73:35] Quote.
[73:37] Because there might be good reasons.
[73:40] Because this was asked.
[73:42] I mean, and...
[73:45] Yeah, the person who was answering didn't know the answer.
[73:49] The person who might have known the answer wasn't present to answer.
[73:54] And so they just answered with, "There might be good reasons."
[73:57] I think that it's legacy stuff.
[73:59] I think that somewhere, sometime, somebody said something.
[74:03] And, you know, it's like a lot of technology.
[74:07] Once somebody introduces it, no one knows what it's there for.
[74:11] And then people, they don't intellectually investigate.
[74:17] And they just assume that the person who did it must have been smarter than them.
[74:21] And knew more than them.
[74:23] When in reality, they forgot to change it.
[74:26] They were investigating something and they never finished.
[74:31] Okay, anyway.
[74:33] Relays. Connection information for peers on the network.
[74:36] Just like the outer message of the sender. Allow gossiping of longer node addresses.
[74:43] Okay.
[74:45] So I actually, I still don't understand what this is good for.
[75:00] There is no payload.
[75:04] So why is the message sent so many times?
[75:16] Or maybe I'm just, because of the debug, the way that I've got the debugging,
[75:19] I may just be printing it out.
[75:21] Yeah, that's what it is.
[75:23] So it prints out the header.
[75:25] Okay. Send header V2. Okay.
[75:29] Okay.
[75:31] All right. So we're going to ignore that message.
[75:36] We will have a listener for that type of message.
[75:46] That just deletes it or something.
[75:49] I don't know.
[75:52] Okay.
[75:54] Okay.
[75:57] Okay.
[75:59] Okay.
[76:01] Okay.
[76:03] Okay.
[76:05] Okay.
[76:07] Okay.
[76:10] Okay.
[76:12] Okay.
[76:14] Okay.
[76:25] Okay.
[76:27] Okay.
[76:29] Okay.
[76:32] Okay.
[76:35] Okay.
[76:38] Okay.
[76:41] Okay.
[76:44] Okay.
[76:46] (gentle music)
[76:48] (gentle music continues)
[76:52] (gentle music continues)
[76:55] (gentle music continues)
[76:59] (gentle music continues)
[77:02] - Let's see.
[77:27] So, all right.
[77:31] So now we get into the fun stuff, I think.
[77:33] I think this is where we actually get into our DSA request.
[77:37] So I'm gonna go ahead and commit this.
[77:45] (gentle music)
[77:48] (gentle music continues)
[77:52] So we can read full messages now.
[78:17] And then we should create our packer.
[78:20] And then this whole thing we can put out
[78:26] into a network file later.
[78:28] So our parser should be separate.
[78:32] That's separate in the previous one.
[78:33] So hopefully the packer that I don't remember
[78:38] if it's under network util or CoinJoin
[78:40] or whatever it's under,
[78:41] but our DSA packer should be separate.
[78:47] Our DSA packer should be in here.
[78:48] So let's see, rep packet, source network.js.
[78:54] Okay, DSA.
[78:56] So this one should be where we take...
[78:59] Yeah, this is the DSA packer
[79:04] network denomination collateral.
[79:06] Okay.
[79:10] And this one, we're gonna change it up slightly.
[79:15] (gentle music)
[79:17] Because we're gonna use amount to denomination.
[79:22] I'm not really worried about that one.
[79:24] Where is the TX?
[79:26] Total size TX, TX collateral.
[79:30] Chosen network, okay.
[79:32] Collateral, where did collateral come from?
[79:35] Collateral, okay, collateral.
[79:39] This is the collateral transaction.
[79:43] Okay, so the collateral transactions work
[79:48] because it's gonna look up the amount.
[79:59] Why do we need denomination then?
[80:03] Let's take a look at this.
[80:05] Is standard denomination, amount to denomination,
[80:08] encoded denom, denomination for,
[80:12] I don't know what that means.
[80:14] Oh no, that's the size of the denomination.
[80:16] Oh, okay, this is their request.
[80:19] Okay, so I want to join in on,
[80:22] that gets me every time.
[80:26] So it's what denomination I am requesting.
[80:32] Okay, got it.
[80:33] And so this one, it looks like we're just gonna
[80:39] write that collateral offset.
[80:43] Let's see.
[80:43] Wait, why is there 000 here?
[80:52] That doesn't seem right.
[80:54] Encoded denom, amount to denominate.
[80:58] Okay, let's take a look at this.
[81:02] Oh no, is this where we get into the bit mask magic?
[81:10] (sniffs)
[81:12] Okay, it's this one.
[81:17] Amount to denominate.
[81:22] Oops.
[81:22] Okay.
[81:27] Input amount.
[81:31] (soft music)
[81:34] (soft music)
[81:36] Shift that many times.
[81:47] I am a little confused.
[81:56] (soft music)
[81:59] (soft music)
[82:01] Okay.
[82:12] So we're gonna shift one.
[82:19] Is it the bit mask?
[82:22] (soft music)
[82:24] (soft music)
[82:26] Okay, I think I see what's going on here, yeah.
[82:36] (soft music)
[82:38] Okay.
[82:46] (soft music)
[82:49] (soft music)
[82:51] Okay, so I'm not 100% sure on that one.
[82:57] I'm gonna try to look that up in the documentation.
[83:00] That one is called, that's DSA, right?
[83:03] DSA.
[83:03] Data messages, DSA.
[83:09] Go and join messages, DSA.
[83:11] Okay, so denom int.
[83:18] Why it's four.
[83:20] I wish it was used exclusively.
[83:24] So it's not clear to me what denom int is.
[83:37] My guess.
[83:41] (soft music)
[83:43] From what I'm seeing there with the one shifting by I,
[83:55] is that these are listed from greatest to least.
[84:05] That's kind of weird.
[84:09] So we're saying, I mean, just to be clear here,
[84:11] one, shift zero is one, shift one is two,
[84:14] shift two is four.
[84:16] So this is the same as doing exponents of two,
[84:18] doing the shift bit.
[84:21] But then if we were to do this to string,
[84:24] then you would see, oops, two, sorry.
[84:27] That's what the binary would look like.
[84:33] But that's kind of confusing to me.
[84:35] (soft music)
[84:38] So this is kind of just,
[84:45] this is dropping off the lower.
[84:53] I don't get this.
[84:57] Maybe I should read the documentation here.
[85:04] Zero if none was found, okay.
[85:06] And this is starting, let's make sure here.
[85:17] Ah, pre-increment.
[85:18] Ah, ah.
[85:21] So there's a one.
[85:24] What?
[85:27] I am so confused.
[85:32] So.
[85:33] Oh, somebody's just being clever.
[85:44] People that use plus plus,
[85:50] that should be at least like a misdemeanor.
[86:02] Oh my goodness.
[86:03] It is hot in the shed today.
[86:07] It went from being cold yesterday in the '60s
[86:11] to now being nearly 80.
[86:13] Utah.
[86:16] Actually, I think I'm gonna open up the door
[86:21] and then prop it open with some water jugs.
[86:24] Okay.
[86:28] (soft music)
[86:30] I mean, the good news is that there's the potential
[86:37] for a bunch of denominations.
[86:39] The bad news is that rather than just specifying
[86:43] the denomination, they're doing this bit shift madness.
[86:47] It should have just been, look,
[86:49] I mean, you're gonna dedicate four bytes to it.
[86:52] Okay, that's 32 bits.
[86:53] That means that you can pick any arbitrary number
[86:55] between zero and four billion.
[86:58] All right.
[86:59] Well, it should be uint, not int.
[87:01] I don't know what that negative is all about, but whatever.
[87:06] So you can pick anything you like,
[87:10] but then they wanna turn into a bit shift instead.
[87:12] And so, I mean, I guess if you were to say
[87:17] if that byte is 255,
[87:22] then you ignore that byte and use the other three bytes
[87:26] and that's more than enough.
[87:28] You don't need to worry about anything outside of that.
[87:31] There's just a lot of strange constraints
[87:40] that didn't need to be constraints.
[87:42] They're completely artificial constraints.
[87:47] And that's what bugs me.
[87:51] (soft music)
[87:54] It's totally fine to say, okay,
[88:03] here's a list of allowed numbers.
[88:04] But to use the same amount of storage
[88:09] that you need for any number.
[88:12] So you're saying, well,
[88:13] potentially we're gonna allow arbitrary numbers.
[88:16] Potentially, or not arbitrary,
[88:17] but potentially we're gonna have an arbitrary set
[88:20] of numbers to choose from.
[88:21] We'll just use the number.
[88:25] It's an abstraction over the number
[88:30] that's the same size as the number.
[88:33] Just use the number.
[88:35] And then you can compare it by the number.
[88:40] You don't have to go through a list and just...
[88:44] Whatever, okay.
[88:48] But so, yeah, I'm a little confused by this
[88:51] because it looks like it's starting at zero.
[88:54] I think the plus plus doesn't actually...
[88:57] Well, let's just try this out real quick.
[88:59] So in a for loop, let I equals zero,
[89:02] I less than 10 plus plus I console.log I.
[89:08] The question is, will this loop start at zero
[89:13] or will it start at one?
[89:16] (computer beeping)
[89:19] Oops.
[89:20] Okay, and it does start at zero.
[89:24] So, yeah, the person who put the plus plus
[89:29] in front of the I really, really does deserve
[89:31] just a little bit of jail time, just enough.
[89:33] Oh, zero if none was found.
[89:40] Okay, so we're not bit shifting zero.
[89:42] Got it, okay.
[89:43] So yeah, we're doing this weird reverse order thing.
[89:46] So we're saying we're gonna take the coin
[89:49] plus 1,000 plus 100 plus...
[89:51] This is just weird and this is just Rube Goldberg-ing it.
[89:56] But okay, moving on, moving on.
[90:00] I needed to understand what was going on here.
[90:02] Now I understand what's going on here.
[90:12] So is there a better way to get this number
[90:17] shift by the number of ones or something?
[90:22] Let me see if I can find a way to do this real quick.
[90:25] 'Cause I do...
[90:27] Stop being clever people, stop.
[90:31] So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[90:37] One, two, three, four plus one.
[90:41] Okay, so there's this.
[90:43] All right, so if I just do one, two, three, four.
[90:48] No.
[90:52] Is there any way for me to use that?
[91:00] (soft music)
[91:02] The math.log, this divided by math.log 10, right?
[91:21] Is that how we get it?
[91:24] No?
[91:25] Is it math 10 divided by that?
[91:26] Math.log 10?
[91:28] No, that shouldn't be it.
[91:29] So math.log.
[91:31] How do I say I wanna find what hour of 10 this is?
[91:36] Math.log.
[91:42] No, it's not math.log 10 divided by this number, right?
[91:45] No, that's not right.
[91:49] That's not right.
[91:50] Oh, whoops.
[91:52] Hold on.
[91:56] (soft music)
[91:59] Four, okay, that's it.
[92:06] So that tells us how many zeros there are.
[92:08] So if we do math.floor of this,
[92:18] then that will give us our basis, right?
[92:22] So because if we were to add one more
[92:27] and divide by one less, that gives us five.
[92:32] And if we were to do this, that gives us six,
[92:35] and then that gives us seven, and then that gives us eight,
[92:39] and then this gives us nine, and then this gives us 10.
[92:48] Okay.
[92:51] (soft music)
[92:53] So if I just take the number,
[93:18] but the bit shift.
[93:19] So that, okay, we're not doing that though.
[93:25] We're doing at most this, right?
[93:27] One, whoops, one, two.
[93:30] I put in one extra zero there somehow.
[93:33] Okay.
[93:34] So this is our max.
[93:37] So it should be nine minus?
[93:38] Eight minus?
[93:43] No.
[93:45] 10 minus?
[93:48] (soft music)
[93:50] So that would be one,
[93:57] and then this would be two, three, four, five, six.
[94:02] (soft music)
[94:05] (soft music)
[94:08] Nine.
[94:18] Oh, that's not working out the way that I thought.
[94:24] Okay, nevermind.
[94:26] I'm gonna abandon that.
[94:27] So we're just gonna have to have
[94:34] (soft music)
[94:36] Here we go.
[94:45] (soft music)
[95:01] And then it's just gonna have to be
[95:03] zero B,
[95:09] two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[95:14] Is it really like this?
[95:26] (soft music)
[95:29] But I'm not bitter.
[95:33] (soft music)
[95:46] (soft music)
[95:49] (soft music)
[95:51] (soft music)
[95:57] (soft music)
[96:00] (soft music)
[96:02] (soft music)
[96:32] Wait,
[96:32] that's not right.
[96:34] And I see why.
[96:38] Because these are all off by one.
[96:42] Because these are all off by one.
[96:44] 'Cause these are all off by one.
[96:46] (humming)
[96:50] 'Cause they're all off by one.
[96:54] 'Cause they're all off by one.
[96:56] 'Cause they're all off by one.
[96:59] (humming)
[97:01] Yeah, this is very strange to me.
[97:05] I'm not, I gotta read that again.
[97:07] But this just doesn't make sense.
[97:09] Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[97:20] No, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[97:24] Okay, that's correct.
[97:25] That's wrong.
[97:29] Right?
[97:30] One, two, three, four.
[97:32] Okay.
[97:33] So one, two, three, four, five.
[97:40] Okay, so we started up at 10,
[97:46] and then we go, so 10 is one,
[97:49] and then one is two,
[97:53] and then point one is four,
[97:57] and point zero one is eight.
[98:00] No, point zero, zero, one.
[98:03] Hold on.
[98:04] Whatever.
[98:05] I think this is it.
[98:06] I'm confused by it, but this is where we're going.
[98:23] We could say, we could say,
[98:25] okay, here's a way that we could retrofit this.
[98:29] The first 255 can be weird denominations.
[98:42] Above that, the denomination must have at least,
[98:51] must be at least 1,000.
[98:56] So it's something like that.
[99:00] Okay.
[99:08] The denomination above that can't have anything down
[99:11] in the last three zeros or something like that.
[99:12] That's a way we could fix this.
[99:15] Then we could have arbitrary amounts,
[99:17] but you couldn't specify doing a coin join on a dust amount.
[99:22] Sitting here, my belt's digging into my tummy again.
[99:28] Okay.
[99:38] Okay, I think that's it.
[99:42] (soft ambient music)
[99:45] Standard denomination masks.
[99:52] Okay.
[99:52] Well, let's go back to,
[99:55] call it a dark sign, but I'm gonna call it Packer.
[100:00.30] (soft ambient music)
[100:04.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[100:32.50] Okay, so when we go to pack this,
[100:34.90] we're gonna take some of that code and bring it back over.
[100:42.42] Okay.
[100:48.26] So,
[101:00.90] darksign.dsa.
[101:03.10] Wow.
[101:06.70] Okay, so we're gonna have denomination.
[101:25.34] We're gonna have network.
[101:26.58] And then we're gonna have
[101:30.54] (soft ambient music)
[101:33.62] transaction.
[101:38.82] Okay, and then we're gonna have denomination masks.
[101:49.62] Is gonna work like this.
[101:55.22] (soft ambient music)
[101:58.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[102:02.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[102:31.34] And then if we do it this way.
[102:32.94] Yeah, okay.
[102:35.50] And we don't need this anywhere else,
[102:40.98] which we probably don't,
[102:42.06] then we might move this.
[102:45.46] A little copying is better than a little dependency.
[102:47.42] And a little moving is better than a little dependency.
[102:49.74] Okay.
[102:51.82] (soft ambient music)
[102:54.90] Okay.
[103:02.98] There we go.
[103:06.18] (soft ambient music)
[103:10.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[103:14.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[103:18.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[103:22.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[103:25.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[103:29.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[103:33.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[103:37.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[104:07.26] There we go.
[104:08.26] So there's that.
[104:12.46] The network and then the transaction.
[104:14.50] And I'm gonna go with chosen network for now,
[104:27.22] just to follow the same as the other one,
[104:29.38] but then we'll switch it later.
[104:30.94] Yeah, we need to be consistent between our functions.
[104:37.26] (soft ambient music)
[104:40.34] (soft ambient music)
[105:03.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[105:07.30] Okay, let's go back and check the other implementation.
[105:27.42] (soft ambient music)
[105:32.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[105:36.82] Oh, okay.
[105:48.58] So yeah, this message was a little bit more
[105:50.06] than just that.
[105:50.90] Got it.
[106:01.74] Three.
[106:02.86] (soft ambient music)
[106:06.30] Okay.
[106:07.14] (soft ambient music)
[106:10.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[106:14.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[106:18.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[106:22.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[106:26.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[106:30.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[106:59.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[107:03.50] Length.
[107:10.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[107:14.54] Offset is zero.
[107:15.94] Okay.
[107:18.38] Agreed.
[107:19.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[107:23.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[107:27.06] All right.
[107:43.58] And then encoded denom.
[107:45.10] Yeah, that's just denom mask.
[107:49.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[107:53.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[107:57.02] Cannot re-declare block scope variable.
[108:02.70] What you talking about, Willis?
[108:05.22] What you talking about, Willis?
[108:08.18] Oh, let's do payload equals.
[108:12.14] There we go.
[108:12.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[108:16.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[108:20.66] Don't need to comment if we just call it payload.
[108:28.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[108:32.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[108:36.38] Maybe we could call it collateral TX.
[108:53.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[108:57.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[109:01.74] I think I'll do that.
[109:09.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[109:13.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[109:17.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[109:44.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[109:48.26] All right, good.
[109:50.78] I like it.
[109:51.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[109:55.54] Okay.
[109:59.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[110:02.06] So this is our request to be allowed.
[110:04.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[110:06.54] And then it's gonna come back
[110:07.38] with a status update and some other stuff.
[110:09.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[110:13.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[110:17.14] Part of me wants to use a data view here.
[110:26.10] I think I'm gonna let that part of me win.
[110:28.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[110:31.98] Come on, where's my db equals?
[110:36.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[110:40.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[110:44.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[110:48.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[110:52.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[110:55.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[110:59.90] Orbit, sorry.
[111:23.86] Sorry.
[111:24.70] Sorry.
[111:25.82] Okay.
[111:26.66] I made a mistake earlier.
[111:27.82] Eight plus eight, 16.
[111:31.10] No, no, no.
[111:31.94] I was right.
[111:32.78] Set uint.
[111:33.62] Set uint 32.
[111:34.46] It is a 32.
[111:35.46] Yeah, four bytes.
[111:37.90] That would be, that should,
[111:41.18] I don't understand why it says int there.
[111:42.62] It should be uint.
[111:43.78] You're not gonna have negative denomination.
[111:49.94] It should be a uint 32.
[111:51.42] Here it says int.
[111:54.98] That's weird.
[111:56.42] That's weird.
[111:57.26] I don't know what that means.
[111:58.10] I don't know what that data type means.
[111:59.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[112:03.66] Okay.
[112:24.14] Oh.
[112:24.98] Here we go.
[112:31.02] So we will shortly.
[112:35.74] Yeah, I'm just gonna change chosen network to network.
[112:42.18] Everywhere, real quick.
[112:43.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[112:47.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[112:51.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[112:55.10] All right.
[113:18.18] Route packet.
[113:19.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[113:22.94] Yeah.
[113:23.78] And then here, we'll change net to network as well.
[113:28.94] Whoops.
[113:34.26] Let's change that in a case-sensitive way.
[113:37.22] Yes, yes.
[113:43.38] That's it.
[113:44.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[113:48.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[113:52.06] All right.
[113:59.78] Let's do this.
[114:00.62] We're gonna change command name to command.
[114:01.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[114:05.82] 'Cause command's already in now.
[114:12.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[114:16.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[114:20.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[114:24.46] Change packet to payload.
[114:49.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[114:53.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[114:57.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[115:01.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[115:05.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[115:09.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[115:13.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[115:41.22] I guess that should be message.
[115:43.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[115:47.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[115:51.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[115:55.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[115:59.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[116:02.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[116:06.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[116:10.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[116:22.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[116:26.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[116:48.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[116:52.30] Okay, there we go.
[117:01.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[117:05.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[117:08.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[117:12.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[117:40.86] Okay, so the next thing that we need to do
[117:43.78] is we need to
[117:45.90] generate, we need to generate a wallet.
[117:56.38] So here's what we're gonna do, we're gonna do.
[118:00.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[118:04.78] Dash phrase CLI.
[118:14.30] Dash keys CLI.
[118:21.26] Dash HD CLI.
[118:25.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[118:29.82] Okay, so let's do that.
[118:41.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[118:45.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[118:49.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[118:53.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[118:57.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[119:23.74] We might even need a dash TX CLI.
[119:28.74] Not sure if that's gonna work out at all,
[119:33.90] we're gonna give it a try.
[119:35.94] Let me try that real quick.
[119:37.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[119:52.50] Okay, dash TX CLI is not a thing yet, we'll get there.
[119:56.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[120:00.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[120:05.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[120:08.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[120:22.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[120:26.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[120:53.70] Okay, let's make sure that that's correct.
[120:57.74] That's correct.
[120:59.94] Okay, cool.
[121:04.90] So we'll go with this.
[121:06.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[121:10.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[121:14.26] So let's try dash phrase, help.
[121:29.54] Gen dash O, seed phrase dot TXT.
[121:38.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[121:42.62] Okay.
[121:46.50] And then dash phrase,
[121:56.14] seed.
[122:05.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[122:08.94] Seed dot hex.
[122:13.66] Okay.
[122:16.50] Toot, toot, toot.
[122:22.42] All right, and that's all we need there.
[122:27.98] And then we can use dash HD.
[122:30.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[122:33.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[122:49.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[122:53.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[122:57.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[123:25.86] What did I, what have I done?
[123:28.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[123:32.70] Let's do this.
[123:49.06] There we go.
[123:54.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[123:58.54] Hmm.
[124:15.50] Interesting.
[124:16.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[124:20.26] (coughing)
[124:28.46] (coughing)
[124:33.26] Ah, yes.
[124:40.62] Okay, got it.
[124:41.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[124:46.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[124:48.50] And then, problem is I need to modify this
[124:52.50] to do a test net.
[124:57.50] Whoops.
[124:59.30] I might need to do that now.
[125:09.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[125:14.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[125:18.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[125:22.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[125:26.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[125:31.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[125:35.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[125:59.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[126:03.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[126:08.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[126:12.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[126:25.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[126:34.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[126:38.86] Okay, so this one, the coin type,
[126:54.62] I don't think we have a separate coin type
[126:57.86] for the test addresses.
[127:01.98] I'm not sure.
[127:04.34] Do we have a separate coin type?
[127:05.94] Dash test net coin type.
[127:11.06] Let me check the dash HD documentation.
[127:22.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[127:26.06] One for test net.
[127:52.02] Okay.
[127:52.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[127:59.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[128:03.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[128:08.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[128:12.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[128:16.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[128:20.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[128:24.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[128:47.82] Okay, so now I've got some addresses to work with,
[128:51.70] some receive addresses and some change addresses.
[128:54.26] Load some dash onto the test.
[129:00.86] Okay.
[129:03.58] (sighs)
[129:09.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[129:13.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[129:16.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[129:20.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[129:24.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[129:45.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[129:49.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[129:53.74] Okay, so we generate
[130:18.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[130:19.90] the test net addresses.
[130:21.62] So I need to implement a test net command for this.
[130:28.74] Okay.
[130:42.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[130:46.30] All right, so let's go, let's go solve that.
[130:51.86] Let me go ahead and submit this documentation real quick.
[130:54.90] This, I don't think this is gonna be too big of an issue.
[131:05.98] Famous last words, as always.
[131:09.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[131:13.46] Okay.
[131:24.74] Going into the CLI, let's pop out of that.
[131:27.14] Let's do,
[131:27.98] let's see, let's just,
[131:31.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[131:34.90] one type.
[131:56.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[132:25.54] From seed, derive path,
[132:27.86] to with.
[132:31.54] All right, to with is where we need to pass in something.
[132:35.78] So let me go check under this, node modules.
[132:38.54] Should have done NPMCI, there we go.
[132:49.62] Uh-oh.
[132:51.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[132:55.62] Mosquito.
[132:56.46] How do we have mosquitoes in the desert?
[133:01.46] 'Cause there's a little pond not too far away, that's how.
[133:06.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[133:10.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[133:14.02] Okay, so we need to have version.
[133:29.62] Yes?
[133:31.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[133:35.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[133:39.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[133:43.86] Okay.
[133:44.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[134:12.98] Hmm.
[134:13.82] I'm a little confused about that,
[134:19.94] but let's follow that down the rabbit hole for a moment.
[134:23.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[134:27.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[134:31.78] Hmm.
[134:57.22] Non-stop version.
[134:58.54] Okay, we don't specifically need to solve this right now.
[135:07.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[135:26.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[135:31.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[135:35.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[135:39.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[135:43.38] Okay.
[136:08.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[136:12.38] Okay, version is T-Print, got it.
[136:16.50] Okay, so I did, I committed a sin here.
[136:19.50] I changed the type of version.
[136:22.78] So that's my own,
[136:26.18] my own sin.
[136:29.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[136:33.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[136:37.30] Version, main net, test net.
[136:40.02] And code PKH, version, main net, test net.
[136:46.50] Okay, so the version that I should be providing
[136:49.86] is in fact...
[136:52.62] Okay, so if we, we'll just modify this locally
[136:59.66] for the time being.
[137:02.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[137:06.02] This is buffer.
[137:26.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[137:30.58] What does this say?
[137:50.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[137:55.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[137:58.34] Okay.
[137:59.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[138:03.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[138:16.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[138:20.74] What's going on here?
[138:33.94] No, we won't worry about it.
[138:36.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[138:40.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[138:44.34] Okay, so that's how we're going to pass the options through.
[139:06.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[139:10.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[139:14.30] Okay, so this one, that's just a bug.
[139:25.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[139:31.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[139:34.98] Okay, so not a big deal to fix that.
[139:44.22] Let's go, we'll go fix that as well.
[139:47.38] Well, let me just do it in line with what I'm doing here.
[139:50.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[139:54.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[139:58.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[140:02.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[140:24.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[140:28.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[140:46.34] Hmm.
[140:49.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[140:51.70] I don't like that.
[140:52.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[140:56.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[141:01.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[141:05.26] (soft ambient music continues)

[141:20.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[141:24.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[141:28.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[141:58.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[142:02.22] Hmm.
[142:04.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[142:06.94] Number.
[142:07.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[142:10.38] I don't know if that's right.
[142:11.22] Let me, yeah, I think that's gonna be...
[142:14.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[142:18.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[142:21.90] Oops.
[142:35.90] I mixed types.
[142:38.78] My bad.
[142:39.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[142:43.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[142:47.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[142:51.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[142:54.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[142:58.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[143:02.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[143:32.30] How many bytes?
[143:33.98] Four bytes.
[143:34.82] You went 32?
[143:35.66] Okay.
[143:36.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[143:40.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[143:44.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[143:48.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[143:51.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[143:55.86] (yawns)
[144:20.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[144:24.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[144:38.66] Okay.
[144:44.70] Let's go ahead and open up this one.
[144:48.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[144:51.22] XPRIV and TPRIV
[144:54.38] are accepted as strings.
[145:00.38] Other XKey versions are accepted as UINT32.
[145:07.54] Testnet is accepted.
[145:17.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[145:20.94] PKH and WIF version are passed through without inspection.
[145:26.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[145:34.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[145:38.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[145:43.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[145:46.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[145:50.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[145:54.78] Okay.
[146:19.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[146:23.54] That's good.
[146:24.38] Wait.
[146:25.22] Dash hive to dash hive.
[146:29.34] Okay. Yes, yes.
[146:30.58] We'll get both of these on that.
[146:33.58] I'm going to put this in another window
[146:37.30] that's nearby for these PRs.
[146:43.30] Okay. So that one we'll take.
[146:46.14] And then this one.
[146:50.30] So if we just delete dash HD and we make a new dash HD,
[146:56.78] let's just paste the contents of this into that.
[147:03.46] Okay.
[147:14.06] And then same thing here.
[147:15.34] We'll do a dash HD.
[147:17.02] Well, this is dash HD CLI, yes?
[147:19.58] Yes. Okay.
[147:20.42] So we need to bring this back a layer.
[147:23.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[147:29.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[147:58.22] Uh-oh.
[147:59.06] I don't know what happened here.
[148:01.46] Maybe it's doing an insert.
[148:04.10] Maybe it's locked up.
[148:05.22] Hmm. I'll have to check on that later.
[148:15.86] Let that other stupid thing for a minute.
[148:19.94] Wait, what's that control Q?
[148:25.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[148:28.98] Nope. Okay.
[148:31.22] Let me just...
[148:32.06] Kill all of them.
[148:37.74] Kill all BI.
[148:43.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[148:47.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[148:51.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[148:55.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[148:59.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[149:03.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[149:10.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[149:14.86] Okay, let me try paste special next time.
[149:36.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[149:40.62] Paste special, advanced paste.
[149:44.38] Paste slowly.
[149:46.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[149:52.58] Oh, uh-oh.
[149:53.42] Okay, let's try that again.
[150:00.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[150:04.70] Set paste.
[150:08.98] Paste slowly.
[150:13.30] Okay, so we'll let that...
[150:30.78] Paste out slowly, and we'll just continue work over here.
[150:33.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[150:37.86] We can do...
[151:02.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[151:06.50] X key version.
[151:09.70] And we can do...
[151:22.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[151:26.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[151:30.26] Just that.
[151:42.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[151:53.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[151:58.10] I think we have a remove option.
[152:01.86] Let me double check on that.
[152:08.14] Yeah.
[152:15.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[152:19.58] No, I should probably have a capture option
[152:27.18] and check option.
[152:28.10] If I was gonna turn this into a library,
[152:30.10] I might do that.
[152:32.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[152:37.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[152:42.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[152:46.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[152:50.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[152:53.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[152:57.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[153:18.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[153:22.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[153:26.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[153:29.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[153:34.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[153:37.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[153:55.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[153:59.86] Not known X key versions.
[154:06.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[154:10.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[154:37.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[154:41.70] Okay, there we go.
[154:59.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[155:03.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[155:15.90] Actually, that one's just fine.
[155:18.86] So, add a version.
[155:22.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[155:26.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[155:30.66] Okay.
[155:45.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[155:53.98] I think we just let those pass through.
[155:56.42] Otherwise.
[155:59.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[156:03.78] I don't think we do anything.
[156:09.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[156:13.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[156:17.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[156:45.26] Why allow it to be an integer?
[156:50.18] It should allow hex as well.
[156:51.90] Yeah.
[156:54.58] Let me make sure I'm allowing hex as well over here.
[156:57.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[157:01.14] So, what if I am allowing hex?
[157:05.62] Dead beef, not to string.
[157:11.38] Yeah, okay.
[157:14.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[157:18.18] Yeah.
[157:19.02] It'll still work.
[157:21.26] Got it.
[157:22.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[157:26.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[157:29.94] And there we go.
[157:54.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[157:58.42] Let's see.
[158:16.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[158:19.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[158:23.86] Okay, so I don't think there's anything we need to do there.
[158:37.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[158:41.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[158:45.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[159:00.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[159:04.58] Okay.
[159:13.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[159:17.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[159:21.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[159:25.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[159:28.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[159:32.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[159:36.82] Okay.
[160:00.98] Okay.
[160:01.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:05.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:09.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:13.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:17.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:21.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:25.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:28.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:33.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:37.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:41.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:45.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:50.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:54.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[160:57.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[161:01.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[161:05.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[161:22.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[161:26.62] Oops.
[161:51.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[161:55.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[161:59.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[162:22.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[162:26.18] Oh, nope.
[162:46.38] Wrong one.
[162:47.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[162:51.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[162:55.06] Okay.
[163:01.22] Let's see.
[163:02.06] I'm trying to do this a different way.
[163:03.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[163:07.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[163:11.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[163:40.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[163:44.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[163:48.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[163:52.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[163:56.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[164:00.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[164:04.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[164:09.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[164:12.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[164:16.82] Don't bother.
[164:41.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[164:46.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[164:49.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[164:53.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[164:57.74] X key.
[165:23.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[165:27.34] What?
[165:31.34] X key.
[165:34.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[165:40.34] I'll have to go look at that.
[165:47.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[165:51.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[165:55.46] Oh, bother.
[166:08.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[166:12.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[166:15.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[166:19.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[166:23.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[166:27.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[166:55.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[166:59.06] All right, where am I at?
[167:04.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[167:08.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[167:12.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[167:16.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[167:19.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[167:49.22] Oh, string or undefined number
[167:51.06] is not assignable to type number.
[167:53.58] All right, let's go check the type on this.
[167:55.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[167:59.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[168:03.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[168:07.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[168:11.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[168:14.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[168:18.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[168:23.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[168:27.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[168:31.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[168:57.94] Okay, so that's now passing through on both sides,
[169:02.46] which wasn't doing, it wasn't doing that before.
[169:04.98] Okay, encode XP.
[169:08.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[169:11.98] Okay.
[169:17.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[169:25.26] Let's go ahead and maybe copy that.
[169:30.26] This is local, so that should be nice and fast.
[169:34.94] Excellent.
[169:35.78] And this one, we can just repeat the same process on.
[169:39.86] Delete it.
[169:40.70] And then paste slowly.
[169:44.26] There we go.
[169:47.58] No!
[169:49.86] Cancel, cancel.
[169:54.18] Set paste first.
[169:55.42] Oh, darn it.
[170:01.26] There we go.
[170:13.42] Okay.
[170:14.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[170:18.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[170:22.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[170:26.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[170:30.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[170:33.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[170:37.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[170:41.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[170:45.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[170:49.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[171:07.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[171:35.82] Okay, so XPUB version, XPRIV, XPUB.
[171:40.82] And then we need to let that go into wherever it goes into.
[171:48.10] From seed, and then derive path.
[171:53.38] HDPath.
[171:55.78] Entries, wait, where are we going here?
[172:01.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[172:04.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[172:08.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[172:12.70] Possible child.
[172:38.50] Next, okay, from seed, that's wallet key.
[172:43.22] Wallet key, derive path.
[172:47.82] So it's from seed, it's never going to need
[172:52.10] the XPUB version, okay.
[172:53.74] Derive.
[172:57.14] Oh, wait, there we go.
[173:07.18] So now it will need versions, or version,
[173:11.78] and then XPRIV version.
[173:15.34] XPUB version.
[173:26.10] Okay, let's see if that's just undocumented behavior.
[173:32.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[173:35.94] HDKey, ops, ops, code XPRIV, code XPRIV, okay.
[173:43.66] So we're taking the ops version there.
[174:01.74] And we're doing that to XPRIV.
[174:04.50] To XPRIV, HD to XPRIV.
[174:11.06] HD to XPRIV.
[174:24.26] Yes.
[174:29.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[174:33.50] Oops, no, I did not mean oops.
[174:54.54] That was an oopsie, oopsie.
[174:58.98] All right.
[174:59.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[175:05.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[175:09.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[175:13.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[175:18.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[175:45.98] Thank goodness for type JS.
[175:47.94] Typed JS, JS with types.
[175:53.50] Can't say type JS, JS with types.
[175:56.14] Thank goodness for JS with types.
[175:57.82] Saving idiots from themselves since right now.
[176:10.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[176:14.26] Okay, so now.
[176:22.62] Oh, not what I wanted to do.
[176:33.22] Okay.

[180:11.58] Uh, what?

[182:38.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[182:42.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[182:46.74] There we go.
[183:12.02] Now I can switch between the three of these.
[183:14.22] Okay.
[183:16.30] So let's get back to this one.
[183:17.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[183:21.26] And it doesn't like that the version of, let's see.
[183:26.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[183:31.06] Huh.
[183:37.22] Okay, so that one, it really wants that one to be
[183:41.82] a number.
[183:42.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[184:10.70] Yeah, I'm not sure about this.
[184:12.14] I don't know where that's coming from, but I don't like it.
[184:16.46] I don't like it.
[184:17.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[184:21.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[184:25.58] Okay.
[184:47.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[184:51.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[184:55.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[184:59.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[185:03.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[185:07.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[185:35.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[185:39.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[185:59.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[186:03.26] Okay, versions.
[186:10.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[186:28.98] Okay, so number or string.
[186:33.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[186:37.10] HD versions.
[186:50.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[186:55.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[186:59.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[187:27.98] U at 32.
[187:29.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[187:33.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[187:37.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[187:41.50] So we're gonna change this one as well.
[188:07.78] (mumbles)
[188:09.94] Okay, so this is, it's making it,
[188:19.74] I wish that I designed this slightly differently
[188:22.50] when I first done it, but when I had first done it,
[188:24.62] but I don't know how I would have done better
[188:27.34] in this particular case.
[188:28.82] Okay, so if it's that or that,
[188:32.14] then
[188:34.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[188:38.26] X priv X equals.
[188:42.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[188:46.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[188:51.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[189:17.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[189:21.34] Do I really want to bring this down to this level?
[189:46.46] I kind of have to.
[189:47.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[190:15.22] The cat is deciding whether to come into the shed or not.
[190:18.30] He'd never come in before.
[190:19.62] And she decided not to, which is a good choice.
[190:25.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[190:29.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[190:33.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[190:37.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[191:07.26] All right.
[191:08.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[191:11.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[191:15.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[191:19.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[191:24.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[191:27.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[191:40.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[191:44.82] Hmm.
[192:03.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[192:07.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[192:11.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[192:32.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[192:36.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[192:40.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[193:06.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[193:10.54] Oh, bother.
[193:34.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[193:38.74] Oh, this is a number.
[193:41.30] Oh, darn.
[193:42.14] Uh, ooh, okay.
[193:43.46] That is a number.
[193:45.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[193:49.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[193:53.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[194:12.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[194:16.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[194:37.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[194:40.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[194:50.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[194:54.70] Hmm.
[195:08.66] Okay.
[195:10.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[195:12.94] Let's see, what's going on here?
[195:14.54] Well, now we're in a bit of a pickle, aren't we?
[195:19.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[195:23.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[195:26.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[195:31.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[195:35.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[195:39.34] Let's see.
[196:03.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[196:07.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[196:10.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[196:14.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[196:18.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[196:22.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[196:26.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[196:30.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[196:44.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[196:47.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[197:00.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[197:04.66] Okay, I think in all of these cases,
[197:22.86] if I'm not mistaken,
[197:24.18] let's see.
[197:29.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[197:33.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[197:37.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[197:41.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[197:45.06] All right, so we're expecting that it's gonna be
[198:11.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[198:15.78] great.
[198:19.26] If it's main net,
[198:20.30] if it's test net,
[198:23.98] if it's
[198:26.58] other net.
[198:31.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[198:36.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[198:40.38] Okay.
[199:02.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[199:06.58] And then we're gonna do the whole thing again,
[199:12.46] but we're just gonna redo it for XPUB.
[199:14.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[199:20.18] And
[199:27.58] TPUB.
[199:29.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[199:33.78] Public.
[199:54.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[199:59.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[200:03.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[200:07.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[200:11.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[200:16.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[200:21.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[200:25.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[200:53.90] What is this?
[200:55.06] Key info dot version.
[200:57.94] So that's gonna end up being an int.
[201:11.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[201:16.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[201:20.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[201:24.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[201:28.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[201:32.50] Okay, cool.
[201:55.58] Versions.
[201:56.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[202:00.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[202:04.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[202:08.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[202:12.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[202:16.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[202:41.86] Okay, so now I think that this is correct.
[202:44.46] Because versions will always be...
[202:49.38] Okay, no, that's right.
[202:52.86] So if it was hex, it doesn't break it.
[202:55.62] If it's not hex, if it's a number, it becomes hex.
[202:58.70] Then we make sure that we assign the right version.
[203:02.50] Okay, and then we have a very similar thing here
[203:06.70] with
[203:07.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[203:11.46] versions dot public
[203:26.42] xpubhex.
[203:30.18] And then we need to do something like this
[203:34.54] so that we're not accidentally
[203:36.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[203:40.46] leaking.
[203:47.02] So that way I can't make a typo, essentially.
[203:49.66] Or at least it's more difficult to make a typo.
[203:54.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[204:06.26] I couldn't accidentally use xprib here.
[204:08.70] Yeah, okay.
[204:11.50] All right, so assert version equals versions dot public.
[204:18.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[204:30.26] All right, there is one thing I don't like about this.
[204:32.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[204:36.34] There we go.
[205:02.14] And we're gonna swap this out.
[205:03.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[205:07.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[205:11.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[205:15.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[205:19.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[205:43.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[205:47.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[205:55.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[206:13.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[206:17.70] I'll try this, actually.
[206:40.86] What if I do,
[206:42.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[206:46.90] will that work?
[206:51.22] Yeah, that will work.
[206:53.10] So we'll declare it this way.
[206:56.34] Whoa, holy bejeebies, coming out of nowhere.
[206:59.82] - So scared.
[207:02.02] - Yeah.
[207:03.38] - Well, we're gonna go to the gym.
[207:05.78] - Okay.
[207:07.22] Oh crap, it's almost time for me to go, isn't it?
[207:09.46] - Yes, well, it's five.
[207:12.02] 17, as you can see.
[207:13.54] - Yeah, all right.
[207:14.38] Well, I'll have to go if you don't see me.
[207:15.22] - But, we're gonna be leaving.
[207:16.46] I thought you need some smoochkins and stuff.
[207:20.34] - Okay.
[207:21.18] - For everybody, because the kids won't see you.
[207:24.22] - All right.
[207:25.82] Hey, buddy.
[207:26.66] It's not doing anything right now, buddy.
[207:30.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[207:34.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[207:38.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[207:42.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[207:46.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[207:50.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[207:54.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[207:58.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[208:02.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[208:06.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[208:31.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[208:35.74] - Muting.
[208:41.78] Unmuted.
[208:42.62] Okay, so missing semicolon somewhere.
[208:50.46] I don't really care much about that.
[208:52.22] Okay, so.
[208:59.90] Xprev.
[209:00.74] So, if I get rid of these two, there's my trick.
[209:08.46] Nothing in there lights up, good.
[209:11.90] That means I'm not using that wrong.
[209:13.98] And if I get rid of these two,
[209:15.50] then nothing up here lights up, and that's good.
[209:21.74] Okay.
[209:22.58] All right, so, yeah, that's a little obnoxious,
[209:27.66] but it's the way that it is.
[209:30.10] And now I need to, instead of versions.public,
[209:35.10] I have xpub_uint32.
[209:38.06] And then xprev_uint32.
[209:45.70] Okay.
[209:59.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[210:00.10] All right, that should work.
[210:01.46] All right, so now, yeah, that whole bit was just,
[210:14.66] it's really public cert.
[210:18.58] If public, I mean,
[210:25.62] I guess we could have thrown all of this in there.
[210:27.78] That actually would make me feel a little bit better
[210:32.14] if we were using this guard right here.
[210:36.58] But is that all we need it for?
[210:40.74] 'Cause this is, yeah, this is just asserting
[210:44.14] that it is what we expect it to be.
[210:46.50] Okay, and then I don't think
[210:52.58] that it makes much sense to nest this,
[210:54.66] but then, you know, see, now we've got this big block
[210:58.94] and you know me, I don't believe in big if else blocks.
[211:02.82] So I'm gonna make an exception to the rule for now
[211:08.02] because I am.
[211:09.14] Because,
[211:17.06] I mean, I guess,
[211:22.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[211:25.78] I mean, I could do like a, I don't know.
[211:30.50] I'll try one thing.
[211:31.54] I'll try one thing.
[211:32.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[211:48.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[211:52.02] See, I just don't know.
[212:15.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[212:19.62] Well, we'll give it a try.
[212:25.22] We can always back out of it if we don't like it.
[212:34.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[212:38.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[212:50.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[212:53.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[213:22.18] (indistinct)
[213:23.66] All right, so we're gonna need to pass in
[213:26.18] versions.public.
[213:28.10] All right, let's see what happens if we do this.
[213:35.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[213:40.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[213:44.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[213:48.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[213:51.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[213:55.90] (soft ambient music continues)
[214:13.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[214:17.74] Okay, we might,
[214:25.66] we might just keep this private for the time being.
[214:41.50] Version to
[214:42.74] tuple.
[214:49.70] We'll call it version to tuple and we will return.
[214:55.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[215:07.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[215:10.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[215:14.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[215:41.98] Inver, testver.
[215:43.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[215:48.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[216:04.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[216:08.14] Version, version.
[216:17.46] Version, version.
[216:21.66] Version, version.
[216:26.46] And this would be
[216:32.82] popent.
[216:33.66] Whoops.
[216:36.74] This would be
[216:38.98] mainent, testent.
[216:41.90] So this would be
[216:45.10] mainent, testent.
[216:47.70] Mainster, testster.
[216:59.78] And then it would be back to versions.
[217:03.02] Version to tuple.
[217:11.54] Okay.
[217:24.78] Version, public.
[217:29.54] Mainster would be xpub
[217:31.42] and then tpub
[217:35.66] and then -hd.versions, no.
[217:42.70] Mainnet.public.
[217:46.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[217:50.02] Testnet.public.
[218:12.86] You know, it cleans it up a little bit, meh.
[218:16.10] I kind of want to readjust it to be this way.
[218:25.42] What could possibly go wrong?
[218:30.18] Actually, I think that will help it be easier
[218:32.46] to do the type checking on.
[218:33.86] So @param
[218:39.66] string or number.
[218:43.54] And then @param string
[218:45.78] and then @param number
[218:48.86] and then @param string number.
[218:52.46] So
[218:53.30] X
[218:58.50] prove.
[219:01.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[219:05.14] You prove tpub.
[219:17.82] Wait.
[219:26.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[219:30.58] There we go.
[219:54.94] Version.
[219:55.78] Mainster.
[219:58.02] Mainent.
[220:00.70] Tester.
[220:04.02] Testnet.
[220:06.38] Okay.
[220:07.22] (mumbles)
[220:10.94] All right.
[220:16.94] So
[220:17.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[220:21.70] HD versions.
[220:34.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[220:38.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[220:42.86] Okay.
[220:57.06] So that has to be a number or a string
[220:59.38] and that's not assignable to type number.
[221:01.78] So this is going to be @type
[221:05.26] number
[221:07.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[221:10.62] Just, just trust me, bro.
[221:12.62] This is a trust me, bro.
[221:15.78] There we go.
[221:20.98] (soft ambient music continues)
[221:26.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[221:30.14] Hey buddy.
[221:44.86] What's up, son?
[221:48.70] Okay. This is where I'm confused.
[221:53.18] How is this one?
[221:54.10] Okay.
[221:55.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[221:57.38] But the other one's not.
[221:58.58] All right.
[222:04.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[222:09.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[222:13.30] I don't understand.
[222:38.90] Why does it know that
[222:40.30] that one is
[222:42.82] but it doesn't know this one.
[222:50.10] That's kind of strange to me.
[222:51.58] I wonder if it's glitching out.
[222:56.42] So string or number, string, number, string, number.
[223:00.02] That returns.
[223:06.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[223:10.46] String, number.
[223:14.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[223:18.54] (soft ambient music continues)
[223:47.78] X key, X key, X key, X key, X key.
[223:50.86] Okay.
[223:56.66] So now we will properly handle versions.
[223:59.98] And here, this one's not as big of a deal
[224:03.26] 'cause it's just a check.
[224:04.86] Version mismatch.
[224:12.22] Where's the assert on this one?
[224:16.74] (soft ambient music continues)
[224:20.66] Let's prove.
[224:29.66] Okay, public, public, public, private, private, private,
[224:38.58] private, private.
[224:39.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[224:45.34] Okay, so this was all just for checking anyway,
[224:48.02] but now we've got
[224:49.02] the code that will
[224:52.42] get this to the right state.
[224:58.46] So since we're exposing it, yeah.
[225:01.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[225:07.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[225:11.18] Why is that?
[225:23.58] I'm just, I'm confused as to why we're getting an error here,
[225:36.50] but not here.
[225:37.66] It seems like we should get an error of both or neither.
[225:40.38] But we're gonna go with it.
[225:52.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[225:55.94] Okay.
[226:19.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[226:23.42] Right, so.
[226:28.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[226:46.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[226:50.86] All right, let's go back up to the top and see.
[227:14.50] So, first of all.
[227:16.18] Interesting.
[227:39.50] I don't know what it's pointing out,
[227:42.46] but it's not detecting it as an error.
[227:44.18] It's not allowing me to do a quick fix jump.
[227:46.90] Let's see if we see.
[227:51.54] Okay, what is it griping about right here?
[227:53.70] Argument of string or number.
[227:56.82] Two XPUB bytes.
[228:00.42] Okay, two XPUB bytes.
[228:07.22] (soft ambient music continues)
[228:11.14] (soft ambient music continues)
[228:15.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[228:19.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[228:23.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[228:51.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[228:55.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[229:12.46] (soft ambient music continues)
[229:16.38] (soft ambient music continues)
[229:39.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[229:43.70] That's the way that goes, though.
[229:52.82] You know, that's just how it goes.
[229:56.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[230:00.74] Okay.
[230:25.70] So, JSON ignore line.
[230:29.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[230:33.82] Okay, so.
[230:56.26] (soft ambient music continues)
[230:58.54] What do you mean?
[230:59.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[231:03.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[231:07.78] Okay, do we have anything else?
[231:29.14] No.
[231:32.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[231:36.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[231:40.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[231:44.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[231:47.94] Okay.
[232:12.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[232:16.70] Okay.
[232:35.46] So.
[232:37.62] Hopefully that's all fixed.
[232:43.74] I'm going to have to continue with this later.
[232:46.26] And it...
[233:06.06] Pastes slowly.
[233:09.26] All right.
[233:10.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[233:14.02] Stringer numbers, not the violins.
[233:20.78] It's a type stringer number.
[233:21.62] (indistinct)
[233:24.02] All right, fine.
[233:28.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[233:33.34] (soft ambient music continues)
[233:37.26] Okay.
[233:41.54] So, what was this type?
[233:43.86] Versions.
[233:46.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[233:50.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[234:18.86] Okay, we might need HD versions option.
[234:22.78] (soft ambient music continues)
[234:28.02] And say, look, HD versions is this.
[234:45.06] (soft ambient music continues)
[234:49.02] HD versions option.
[234:50.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[234:54.86] Is that.
[234:56.66] (soft ambient music continues)
[235:00.58] No, this is HD versions.
[235:04.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[235:09.02] (soft ambient music continues)
[235:12.94] (soft ambient music continues)
[235:16.86] (soft ambient music continues)
[235:46.38] Okay, there we go.
[235:47.58] Finally.
[235:48.42] (soft ambient music continues)
[235:53.34] Okay, so now this will accept the options.
[236:04.54] Now let's see what else is broken in it here.
[236:07.30] Okay.
[236:09.34] Two XPRIV.
[236:10.98] So that should in fact be optional.
[236:14.70] (soft ambient music continues)
[236:16.94] HD2XPRIV.
[236:20.74] Options should be optional.
[236:22.58] Here, options should be optional.
[236:26.30] (soft ambient music continues)
[236:30.90] Will I regret that?
[236:31.82] Maybe.
[236:32.66] I don't know.
[236:33.50] (soft ambient music continues)
[236:37.50] Okay.
[236:39.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[236:44.58] (soft ambient music continues)
[236:48.50] All right.
[236:55.62] (soft ambient music continues)
[236:59.74] All right.
[237:00.58] What is it griping about me now?
[237:02.82] (soft ambient music continues)
[237:06.78] All right.
[237:07.62] It's something that for whatever reason counts.
[237:10.70] It's in the error list, but it's not an error.
[237:14.46] Cyclomatic complexity is too high.
[237:16.06] Okay, fine.
[237:17.10] Fine, we'll bump it up to 30.
[237:19.06] Okay.
[237:20.14] We'll bump it up.
[237:21.18] (soft ambient music continues)
[237:25.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[237:29.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[237:33.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[237:37.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[237:55.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[237:59.10] So what do we have here?
[238:13.10] We've got test net,
[238:16.10] XPUB version,
[238:20.94] XPRIV version,
[238:23.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[238:26.10] WIF version,
[238:27.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[238:29.10] Adder version.
[238:30.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[238:34.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[238:39.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[238:44.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[238:50.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[238:54.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[238:59.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[239:04.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[239:09.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[239:15.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[239:19.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[239:24.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[239:29.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[239:34.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[239:40.10] XPUB, TPUB, main net, test net, hex.
[239:45.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[239:48.10] And this would be main net, test net, hex.
[239:52.10] And this is the same.
[239:54.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[239:59.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[240:04.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[240:09.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[240:13.10] There we go.
[240:15.10] Okay, so I'll actually need to update the documentation for that,
[240:19.10] but that's where we're at.
[240:21.10] So, yeah, it went down a different path,
[240:24.10] but this is probably the right time to go down it.
[240:30.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[240:36.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[240:40.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[240:43.10] Okay, so this is something that Jojo would probably like to know about.
[240:48.10] I'm actually curious, he said that he did this.
[240:54.10] How did you do Dogecoin without these?
[241:02.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[241:06.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[241:11.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[241:16.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[241:21.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[241:27.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[241:32.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[241:37.10] (soft ambient music continues)
[241:41.10] Okay, cool.
[241:42.10] So, key takeaway here.
[241:47.10] Now I've got the Dash HD,
[241:50.10] which it looked like Dash Keys was already good.
[241:53.10] Dash HD was not already good.
[241:56.10] But now Dash HD is good where we can use Testnet
[242:00.10] and pass through Magic Bytes.
[242:03.10] And, you know, maybe he was using it with Dash Keys directly
[242:07.10] rather than Dash HD.
[242:09.10] But anyway, so now we have the ability
[242:14.10] to do the stuff we need to do with the wallet
[242:17.10] to carry on with the other stuff we were doing.
[242:23.10] And so I will get back to that other stuff.
[242:27.10] That other stuff, whatever that was from light years ago.
[242:32.10] Okay.
[242:34.10] So I will have to manually update these
[242:37.10] and go ahead and run them and, you know,
[242:39.10] go through the paces with them and make sure they actually work.
[242:41.10] But now we should have the Testnet option
[242:43.10] so we should be able to do what we need to do.
[242:52.10] Um...
[242:53.10] Yeah, I gotta go.
[242:57.10] But, yeah, now that we have the Testnet option,
[243:00.10] now we can load up the addresses with money
[243:05.10] and then we can send our transactions and our DSA.
[243:11.10] And there might be an update that I need to make to Dash TX,
[243:15.10] which JoJo's got some update that he needs in Dash TX as well,
[243:19.10] so that'll be a good time to do that.
[243:22.10] But I gotta head out to a meet-up.
[243:24.10] I will catch you later.
[243:25.10] Thanks for tuning in.
[243:26.10] Like, sub, follow if you want to.
[243:28.10] Let the one who guides you.
[243:29.10] And I'll catch you next time.
[243:32.10] Adios.
