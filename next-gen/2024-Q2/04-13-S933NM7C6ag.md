## Episode Description

The video covers the process of forking and updating the Dash RPC library, transitioning it to a new independently maintained version.

## Episode Summary

In this coding session, the developer works on forking and updating the Dash RPC library. They go through a series of steps to create a new version, including applying various pull requests, updating dependencies, and restructuring the package. The process involves careful consideration of which changes to incorporate, how to maintain compatibility, and how to structure the new package for better maintainability. Throughout the session, the developer encounters and resolves various challenges, ultimately creating a new, independently maintained fork of the Dash RPC library.

## Chapters

00:00 - Introduction and Setting Up the Task

The developer begins by explaining the task at hand: loading some Dash onto a test wallet and working on RPC functions to check UTXOs and address usage. They discuss the need to fork the existing Dash RPC library and create a new version. This chapter sets the stage for the work to be done and outlines the initial steps in the process.

05:57 - Reviewing and Applying Pull Requests

In this section, the developer goes through existing pull requests for the original Dash RPC library. They carefully review each PR, discussing the changes and deciding which ones to incorporate into the new fork. This process involves considering the impact of each change, its compatibility with the current codebase, and its relevance to the project's goals.

20:21 - Restructuring the Package and Updating Dependencies

The developer begins the process of restructuring the package, updating its metadata, and managing dependencies. They work on the package.json file, reorganizing fields, updating version numbers, and removing unnecessary dependencies. This chapter showcases the importance of maintaining a clean and well-organized package structure.

45:27 - Implementing Core Changes and Resolving Conflicts

This chapter focuses on implementing core changes to the library, including removing deprecated dependencies like Bluebird and simplifying async operations. The developer encounters and resolves merge conflicts, carefully considering how to integrate changes without breaking existing functionality. This section highlights the challenges of updating and maintaining open-source libraries.

82:55 - Finalizing the Fork and Publishing

In the final chapter, the developer completes the forking process, makes final adjustments to the package, and prepares it for publication. They update the README, ensure all necessary files are included, and perform final tests. The chapter concludes with the developer publishing the new fork to npm and notifying relevant parties about the updated, independently maintained version of the Dash RPC library.

## Transcript

[00:00] Hello beautiful people, welcome back to another episode of whatever we're doing here.
[00:19] Let me put the knives away and press the big red button, that'll do.
[00:29] Okay, so, let's talk about what we're up to today.
[00:35] We're going to load some dash onto the test wallet, yesterday we mostly were focused not
[00:40] in the dash join as much as it was in dash, there might have been a change to dash keys,
[00:49] I don't think there was a change to dash keys, I could be wrong about that, but it was mostly
[00:53] dash HD, mostly dash HD, and now we're going to, we're going to do the RPC to check if,
[01:06] check UTXOs and check if an address has been used.
[01:09] That's what we need.
[01:10] So let me see if I can find the one to check if the address has been used, because that's
[01:13] going to be the first one that we're going to need right off the bat, would be used,
[01:25] list address balances, list address groupings, let's see, list address balance, okay, so
[01:53] let's see, maybe it's address transactions, I forget how I did this before, get address
[02:03] info, all right, let's try this one out, let's see what the return looks like, is mine solvable
[02:17] description, okay, interesting, I wonder what their, okay, that's the wallet ID, that's
[02:26] the wallet ID, okay, that might be the fingerprint, but that's the wallet ID, I don't, I don't
[02:40] think they do account IDs in Dash Wallet, I'm not sure, this does not look like enough
[02:50] information, is mine solvable, is watch only, is script, is compress, is change, times M,
[02:57] HD chain ID, HD key path, HD master fingerprint, see that, that concerns me, because this should
[03:07] not be using a fingerprint, it should be using the wallet ID, it says fingerprint here, the
[03:12] fingerprint says, in the spec, I don't remember exactly how it words it, but basically this,
[03:20] it's not, well, I guess if it's internal to the wallet, I guess it's okay, I don't know,
[03:25] I don't, the fingerprint, whatever, we'll just move past that, okay, what I want to
[03:33] know, I want to, I basically, I think I want to know transactions, get address, balance,
[03:43] deltas, TXIDs, okay, so here's what we need to do, we need to get address TXIDs and address
[03:48] UTXOs, we go ahead and we grab those together, and then that will, what will that do for
[04:05] us, address TXIDs, that will tell us if it is used, basically TXIDs is the only thing
[04:12] we need, we just need to know if it's used, if it's used, we're not going to use it, what
[04:17] we want to do is get a whole bunch of these, and I don't think that we can, let's see what
[04:23] the output looks like, yeah, addresses, start, end, yeah, the problem here is that there's
[04:39] no mapping between them, I wonder if we can find one that has a mapping between them,
[04:42] didn't I have to do this just recently, because what if we do get UTXOs, was that, we need
[04:52] something that actually shows us not the sum of all of them, we need something that shows
[05:00] us the relationship between them, okay, so here we have get address deltas, okay, this
[05:09] is great, this will work, because if an address has a delta, then we don't want to use it,
[05:20] and address deltas has the address in it, and we could probably do a thousand at a time,
[05:34] so address deltas and address mempool, I don't know if, dang it, we just had to go, this
[05:42] is what I was working on in the other project, all right, mempool, so we're going to do both,
[05:57] we're going to do address deltas and address mempool, and I think that that is going to
[06:01] give us the information that we need, we're optimizing around the idea that an address
[06:15] is only going to be used once, now that's the optimization, an address can be used more
[06:21] than once, but we're going to optimize around the idea that an address is only used once,
[06:26] that's the ideal, that's the happy path, that's what we're going to look for, so we need get
[06:30] address deltas and we need get address mempool, so let me go swap this out over here in this
[06:37] ad hoc documentation, because those are the RPCs that we're actually going to use, is
[06:43] going to be get address deltas, get address mempool, let's make sure that that's right,
[07:12] get address mempool, get address deltas, all right, deltas, mempool, deltas and then mempool,
[07:34] all right, it'd be nice if we could get some, oh and I'm not actually listening to a podcast
[07:42] let me turn that off, oh and are we streaming, we are streaming, okay is everything on, everything
[07:55] is on, okay for some reason we weren't recording, but now we're recording, so I mean we were
[08:03] streaming but we weren't recording, yeah, yeah, okay, so I didn't need the get address
[08:10] UTXOs because that's not actually very helpful, I just need get address deltas, but I don't
[08:15] just need that, I need also get address mempool, because the address deltas plus address mempool
[08:20] is going to tell us the balance of the address and whether or not it's been used because
[08:24] the balance could be zero if we only do UTXOs, so yeah, we need both, we need both, okay,
[08:48] all right, so let's go get that implemented in our code here, so let me see if I'm still
[08:52] logged in wherever that was, okay, I'm still logged in, all right, so we need to bring
[08:59] in now some more code, we need to bring in -TX, so I'm thinking that we probably are
[09:17] going to fork the -DRPC and fork it as -RPC, because they're not taking what we're doing
[09:33] upstream and there's fixes that I want that I don't think that, basically it's working
[09:44] for them, right, they haven't had problems with it, they're not building it for other
[09:48] developers, they're building it for themselves, it just kind of open sources their policy
[09:56] and it so happens that other than some legacy craft of the bluebird and async or whatever
[10:02] it was, it's decent code, you know, it does what it needs to do and it seemed to be well
[10:08] tested and it seemed like it was quality code, so it was useful, -TX, but I think I am, yeah,
[10:20] I'm going to go see if I can actually reserve that name right now, can't, is -RPC available,
[10:32] yes it is, okay, cool, so I'm going to go snag that real quick, I'm going to rename
[10:40] our -DRPC that we've got here, I'm going to go into settings and we're just going to,
[10:53] we're going to make this our own.
[11:04] This is not just going to be a PR branch, okay, and then we're going to rename it.
[11:34] And then we need to change the default branch name, I don't know if I can do that from here,
[12:03] it's not the right settings apparently, okay, I want to change rename branch to main, and
[12:14] we'll, yeah, we're just going to do it, main, ha, that's funny, that's funny because I put
[12:30] the protection rule in place before it existed, there we go.
[12:40] So first, let me go clone this, and I'm just, I'm not going to do the full work on this
[12:44] right now, I'm just going to reserve that repo for us, or that namespace for us, because
[12:52] we're going to make good use of it.
[12:56] Okay, so let's make sure that we're up to date, git pull rebase, okay, git remote add
[13:08] upstream -DRPC, actually we're just going to call this legacy because I don't think
[13:19] it's really an upstream as much as it is a legacy, but git pull rebase legacy master.
[13:28] Okay, already up to date, great.
[13:53] Here I need to grab one of the PRs, let's do, this one's benign, we'll just go ahead
[14:06] and add this one as in, so git rebase style version, git rebase master, git push.
[14:23] I'm going to make sure this is actually the way that I want it to be.
[14:39] Actually let's just do this, now we're just going to rename this to -RPC, and then we'll
[14:53] just use some of the same verbiage we use for the other ones as far as their descriptions.
[15:02] Wait, are we on dashboard, oh, we're on dashboard, let's do -hive, -hive.
[15:27] Okay javascript-sdk.
[15:36] Let's see, where were we at, -tx.
[16:05] Okay.
[16:16] Okay.
[16:33] All right.
[17:02] So our version, we're going to go ahead and knock this to 19, well we'll do 19, what is
[17:11] it, pre-1, something like that, we'll take this name, and we'll move it right on down
[17:20] to the contributor spot.
[17:45] Let's see if audio comes back, sometimes it won't, testing 1-2, okay, that looks like
[17:58] that's working, I think it's because the browser messed up, okay.
[18:05] Looks like audio's back.
[18:28] Okay, we'll fix all that stuff later, we'll rip out the dependencies, -evo, -hive, -hive,
[18:57] -drpc-rpc.js.
[18:58] Okay, so we're back.
[19:26] Okay.
[19:51] I'll update the README, I'll publish it, and then I'll start working through those
[20:13] PRs later, but we'll get what we need in.
[20:19] And then I'll release it as, yeah, the version 19.
[20:25] All right, so npm audit fix, okay, there we go.
[20:52] Yeah, we should be able to get rid of all this babble crap, junk dependencies, brah.
[21:20] Okay, README, let me see if on this other one, do we put the .js in the README or nay?
[21:49] We do, okay.
[21:50] I'll make sure I do that so that we're being consistent.
[22:15] And I'm going to put the fork notice in here.
[22:44] Because we're going to un-fork this, it's not, there's no longer that type of fork.
[23:04] It's the MIT preamble.
[23:28] Okay, what do we got, 2022?
[23:58] Okay, so.
[24:04] Yeah, we should be able to get rid of that.
[24:34] Yeah, we should be able to get rid of that.
[25:04] Yeah, we should be able to get rid of that.
[25:32] All right, let me go check out something, github.com, therootcompany, asyncrouter.js
[25:50] maybe?
[25:52] How do I handle that there?
[26:17] Okay, I'm going to go to the root.
[26:46] Oops.
[26:47] Okay, so.
[26:48] I'm going to go to the root.
[27:16] Okay.
[27:26] I'm going to go to the root.
[27:53] So, we'll take the @ here, and that's just going to be -rpc.
[28:20] Okay.
[28:26] Okay, let's fix this up.
[28:55] -rpc.
[29:01] So, -rpc -rpc -rpc.
[29:27] Okay.
[29:40] So, -rpc -rpc -rpc -rpc -rpc -rpc.
[30:10] Okay.
[30:15] So, -rpc -rpc -rpc -rpc -rpc.

[30:57] (somber music continues)
[31:00] - Day.
[31:22] (somber music continues)
[31:25] (somber music continues)
[31:54] Okay, there we go.
[31:55] (somber music continues)
[31:59] Just a little bit of cleanup there.
[32:00] (somber music continues)
[32:02] Now call back, set timeout, batch call,
[32:05] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[32:07] Let's get rid of all that.
[32:08] (somber music continues)
[32:12] (somber music continues)
[32:41] How is this on her lip?
[32:43] (somber music continues)
[32:46] Okay.
[32:49] (somber music continues)
[32:53] (somber music continues)
[32:56] (somber music continues)
[32:59] (somber music continues)
[33:03] (somber music continues)
[33:06] (somber music continues)
[33:10] (somber music continues)
[33:13] (somber music continues)
[33:17] (somber music continues)
[33:20] (somber music continues)
[33:24] (somber music continues)
[33:27] (somber music continues)
[33:30] All right.
[33:57] (somber music continues)
[34:00] Now let's show the overview, quick reference.
[34:16] (somber music continues)
[34:20] (somber music continues)
[34:24] Let's see, dash, docs, RPCs, quick reference.
[34:38] (somber music continues)
[34:46] (somber music continues)
[34:50] All right.
[34:57] (somber music continues)
[35:02] (somber music continues)
[35:05] (somber music continues)
[35:09] (somber music continues)
[35:12], (somber music continues)
[35:17] (somber music continues)
[35:20] (somber music continues)
[35:42] (somber music continues)
[35:45] All right, that looks good.
[36:01] Okay, so we'll go ahead and claim this
[36:06] so we can get that updated and I might act it.
[36:11] I don't know.
[36:12] I've already got the shims I need in for right now,
[36:14] but we'll want to get those in for...
[36:16] Well, maybe we'll just go ahead
[36:17] and publish it with the shims.
[36:18] Why not?
[36:19] (somber music continues)
[36:22] The NPM audit.
[36:38] Let's see what's wrong.
[36:41] Mini match, of course.
[36:43] In Mocha.
[36:47] Yeah.
[36:48] (somber music continues)
[36:51] SC2048.
[37:09] (somber music continues)
[37:13] (somber music continues)
[37:41] We'll go ahead and just force the update.
[37:44] It looks like it's all Mocha related, so.
[37:49] (somber music continues)
[37:53] (somber music continues)
[37:56] (somber music continues)
[38:00] (somber music continues)
[38:05] (somber music continues)
[38:32] (somber music continues)
[38:36] (coughing)
[38:53] (somber music continues)
[38:57] I probably want to get as many of those PRs in.
[39:19] (somber music continues)
[39:23] As I can.
[39:24] Hmm, we may end up rewriting this history,
[39:28] but that's okay.
[39:29] (somber music continues)
[39:33] Okay, let me go ahead and do this.
[39:45] (somber music continues)
[39:48] (somber music continues)
[40:18] All right, let me go ahead and get that Shemin.
[40:20] Let me see what we can do.
[40:21] Okay, you know, since I'm here,
[40:25] since I'm here, I'm just gonna do it.
[40:27] I'm just gonna go ahead and get those PRs through.
[40:32] (somber music continues)
[40:36] (somber music continues)
[40:39] Whoops, oh, whoops, that was the wrong one.
[40:55] (somber music continues)
[40:58] (somber music continues)
[41:02] Okay, so what I wanted to do,
[41:21] (somber music continues)
[41:24] (somber music continues)
[41:28] Okay.
[41:43] (somber music continues)
[41:46] (somber music continues)
[41:50] Hit switch.
[42:08] Yeah, this is where we're gonna have
[42:10] a little bit of an issue.
[42:11] (somber music continues)
[42:15] (somber music continues)
[42:19] (somber music continues)
[42:22] (somber music continues)
[42:41] (somber music continues)
[42:45] Let me,
[42:54] let me go back here.
[42:58] Where is, where's our fork at?
[43:03] Let's go back to our fork.
[43:11] Okay, githubunforkproject.
[43:13] (somber music continues)
[43:19] Nope, that's wrong.
[43:33] Send a ticket, where's the thing?
[43:41] There we go.
[43:42] Dash.
[43:52] There we go.
[44:05] (somber music continues)
[44:09] (somber music continues)
[44:12] (somber music continues)
[44:16] (somber music continues)
[44:19] (somber music continues)
[44:22] (somber music continues)
[44:44] (somber music continues)
[44:47] Wow, that's a little bit, okay, boom.
[45:01] Oh, it didn't, it didn't un-fork it.
[45:06] Okay, so we are going to create some PRs.
[45:13] Of our own.
[45:15] Okay, so this is what I think we ought to do, actually.
[45:18] So we're going to git switch,
[45:20] git switch main, git switch -c ref hard fork.
[45:27] (somber music continues)
[45:34] Oops, put that in the wrong place.
[45:39] (somber music continues)
[45:43] All right.
[45:47] (somber music continues)
[45:52] (somber music continues)
[45:55] All right, so, yeah, let's try this.
[46:17] We're going to git switch to main.
[46:19] We're going to git rebase.
[46:20] We're going to just git reset - - hard master.
[46:25] We're going to push force.
[46:27] I'm expecting that not to work, but it did work.
[46:31] Just kind of confusing.
[46:33] Because shouldn't the branch,
[46:36] oh, the branch protections aren't in place yet
[46:38] because I removed them so that we could do
[46:40] precisely what we're doing here, here now.
[46:42] Okay.
[46:43] So, yeah, let's first, we're just going to go in
[46:47] and we're going to switch the main branch.
[46:50] Oops, branches.
[46:51] Okay, so now,
[46:54] general,
[46:58] or swap,
[47:00] make that main.
[47:04] Okay.
[47:08] We are going to go to branches and re-enable the protections
[47:13] and press my finger.
[47:17] Oh, it didn't have me press my finger.
[47:19] Okay, whatever.
[47:20] All right, then.
[47:22] Okay, it looks like our unfork, did it complete?
[47:41] Not yet.
[47:42] Okay.
[47:44] So, let's just go through and apply those PRs
[47:49] and get a version released out of this.
[47:53] And we'll have more cleanup to do later,
[47:55] but we'll just try to do it quick and easy.
[47:59] All right, ready.
[48:01] So, number one is use format tool.
[48:04] Okay, let's go ahead and do that.
[48:06] So, git switch.
[48:09] This one, we actually, we just need to go back.
[48:12] Oh, dang it.
[48:13] Where's this?
[48:17] Choo-choo-choo-choo.
[48:19] Okay.
[48:27] So, we're gonna make a new pull request
[48:33] and we're gonna pull request
[48:35] our own.
[48:39] (soft music)
[48:41] And we're gonna do from main.
[48:52] We're gonna do, what was it?
[48:53] Ref.
[48:54] Use format tool.
[49:01] That's numero uno.

[53:02] (soft music)
[53:08] (soft music)
[53:10] I think I actually had a PR for that specifically,
[53:34] didn't I?
[53:34] (soft music)
[53:37] Anyway.
[53:43] (soft music)
[54:04] Okay.
[54:05] Let's update.
[54:07] (soft music)
[54:12] (soft music)
[54:14] Whoa, what?
[54:41] Changes must be made through a pull request.
[54:44] Oh, dang it.
[54:45] They can't un-fork it too soon.
[54:49] Goodness, it keeps on going to the wrong thing.
[54:51] How could I change the default base repository?
[54:59] (cat meowing)
[55:04] (soft music)
[55:06] All right, great.
[55:29] (soft music)
[55:32] (soft music)
[55:35] Okay, I do want to take a look here.
[55:45] So...
[55:46] (soft music)
[55:50] (soft music)
[55:52] I want to get rid of that one.
[56:12] That's not what I need.
[56:13] What I need is this shim.
[56:15] This is the numero uno that we need.
[56:17] Well, two things.
[56:18] Number one...
[56:19] (soft music)
[56:21] (soft music)
[56:24] (soft music)
[56:26] (soft music)
[56:29] (soft music)
[56:31] (soft music)
[56:34] (soft music)
[56:51] (soft music)
[57:00] (soft music)
[57:02] Okay, uses native promises rather than async.
[57:05] And then remove Bluebird.
[57:07] So we do npm audit fix.
[57:15] Let's go ahead and do that one.
[57:17] (soft music)
[57:24] (soft music)
[57:26] So it's updating some Mocha stuff.
[57:50] Mocha will probably still run.
[57:52] I might even try it.
[57:53] Am I on a virtual machine?
[57:56] No, I'm not.
[57:57] Okay, I'll think about it.
[57:59] Mocha's probably okay, right?
[58:02] None of these 6,000 dependencies
[58:06] are malicious today, right?
[58:08] (soft music)
[58:10] (soft music)
[58:13] Okay.
[58:32] And we'll actually open this PR twice.
[58:38] 'Cause I actually do want to open it both for them.
[58:43] (soft music)
[58:46] (soft music)
[58:48] (soft music)
[58:52] (soft music)
[58:54] (soft music)
[59:13] (soft music)
[59:16] So this is to our, dang it.
[59:29] (mimicking)
[59:32] (soft music)
[59:34] (soft music)
[59:36] (soft music)
[59:39] Okay, there we go.
[60:07] (soft music)
[60:09] Let's try running the tests.
[60:10] (soft music)
[60:14] (soft music)
[60:21] (soft music)
[60:27] (soft music)
[60:34] (soft music)
[60:36] Okay, should a callback with error if invalid JSON.
[60:42] Huh.
[60:44] I wonder, let's just go check master real quick on that.
[60:49] Okay, so that is currently failing
[60:56] in the other case, anyway.
[60:58] (soft music)
[61:00] (soft music)
[61:03] Okay, so we'll apply that one.
[61:18] (soft music)
[61:21] (sighs)
[61:25] (soft music)
[61:30] All right, and then we need to get that shim in here.
[61:33] (soft music)
[61:35] Next async library.
[61:46] (soft music)
[61:48] (soft music)
[61:51] Okay, so let's just put this in here.
[62:16] (soft music)
[62:19] Let's take a look at our get log here.
[62:28] So update package lock.
[62:31] Oops.
[62:36] (soft music)
[62:39] (soft music)
[62:42] Okay, what was the next one?
[63:07] Was the security update.
[63:10] So trying to do these kind of basically
[63:14] in non-controversial order.
[63:16] So that they can accept them if they want to,
[63:19] but I'm not expecting them to accept them.
[63:21] Okay, so the number three would be use the format tool
[63:27] because we want to use a format tool
[63:29] before we do any sort of code changes.
[63:34] (soft music)
[63:37] (soft music)
[63:39] (soft music)
[63:42] Let's take a look and see.
[64:09] (soft music)
[64:12] Okay.
[64:14] (soft music)
[64:17] Okay, that's an actually a bug fix, I believe.
[64:39] (soft music)
[64:41] Yeah, that was a bug fix I encountered.
[64:44] So let's apply the bug fix next.
[64:46] (soft music)
[64:49] (soft music)
[64:52] (soft music)
[64:54] (soft music)
[64:57] (soft music)
[64:59] (soft music)
[65:02] (soft music)
[65:04] Okay.
[65:27] (soft music)
[65:29] (soft music)
[65:32] Okay.
[65:52] (soft music)
[65:54] All right, so the number four,
[65:59] all right, let's make sure this is right.
[66:02] All right, so the number four would be
[66:06] to fix the actual bug.
[66:08] Going in non-controversial order here.
[66:16] (soft music)
[66:20] (soft music)
[66:23] (soft music)
[66:33] (soft music)
[66:35] (soft music)
[66:37] (soft music)
[66:40] (soft music)
[66:43] (soft music)
[66:46] (soft music)
[66:48] (soft music)
[66:50] (soft music)
[66:53] (soft music)
[66:55] (soft music)
[66:58] (soft music)
[67:00] (soft music)
[67:03] (soft music)
[67:18] Okay.
[67:28] (soft music)
[67:31] (soft music)
[67:33] (soft music)
[67:36] (soft music)
[67:38] (soft music)
[67:41] (soft music)
[67:43] (soft music)
[67:46] (soft music)
[67:48] (soft music)
[67:51] (soft music)
[67:53] (soft music)
[67:58] (soft music)
[68:03] (soft music)
[68:09] (soft music)
[68:13] (soft music)
[68:20] (soft music)
[68:22] (soft music)
[68:32] Dang it.
[68:38] Rawr.
[68:41] (soft music)
[68:43] (soft music)
[69:12] Get reset.
[69:13] (soft music)
[69:16] Head one.
[69:17] (soft music)
[69:20] Okay, let's, how about we do this?
[69:24] Let's just do, good pull.
[69:25] (soft music)
[69:28] (soft music)
[69:30] (soft music)
[69:33] (soft music)
[70:02] I don't understand, why is this a,
[70:04] (soft music)
[70:06] Okay, let's make sure that I've got this right.
[70:12] (soft music)
[70:14] (soft music)
[70:16] I love this.
[70:34] (soft music)
[70:37] (soft music)
[70:40] Okay.
[70:50] (soft music)
[70:54] (soft music)
[70:56] (soft music)
[71:19] So that's, branch number four.
[71:24] (soft music)
[71:26] And then.
[71:29] (soft music)
[71:31] And then the shem should be number five.
[71:45] So we'll add the shem next.
[71:47] And if we don't get something back from them.
[71:50] (soft music)
[71:52] Then.
[71:53] (soft music)
[71:56] We will just.
[71:57] (soft music)
[71:59] Do it on our own.
[72:00] (soft music)
[72:03] (soft music)
[72:06] Oh, whoops.
[72:23] No, hold on.
[72:24] (soft music)
[72:28] (soft music)
[72:30] Okay, we got that one.
[72:42] We need to add the prototype.
[72:45] (soft music)
[72:47] I should probably make sure that this is still
[72:49] what we're doing over in the code
[72:52] that we're using right now.
[72:54] (soft music)
[72:56] (soft music)
[72:58] Let me make sure that the shem is up to date here.
[73:16] So I'll go ahead and I'll add this and then I'll re-add it.
[73:18] That's what I'll do.
[73:20] Let's see, prototype.
[73:22] (soft music)
[73:24] (soft music)
[73:27] RPC.
[73:33] (soft music)
[73:36] I think maybe this makes sense.
[73:44] (soft music)
[73:47] (soft music)
[73:49] So prototype.
[73:58] (soft music)
[74:00] Okay, let's just put it right here.
[74:05] That seems like that would make sense, roughly speaking.
[74:09] (soft music)
[74:11] (soft music)
[74:14] Not quite sure what rhyme or reason they use
[74:28] to where they put stuff.
[74:30] But I'll try to follow the best I can.
[74:33] I think it would make sense to put the sleep down here.
[74:37] This does look like where the utility functions
[74:39] are placed.
[74:40] (soft music)
[74:42] So I'm gonna go with that.
[74:45] And then I get height.
[74:47] (soft music)
[74:49] We'll do.
[74:50] (soft music)
[74:53] I don't know where we'll do that.
[74:54] But I would just put it right under the init
[74:56] because it is critical to the init.
[74:59] (soft music)
[75:02] And then I'll also put the onConnected right underneath.
[75:08] (soft music)
[75:09] Because that's also critical to the init.
[75:13] Okay, so there we go with that.
[75:15] (soft music)
[75:18] And internal changes is just gonna be
[75:22] our PC client up here.
[75:25] (soft music)
[75:26] And do we have LMNOP?
[75:28] Do we have any sort of...
[75:30] I'm just gonna put it here.
[75:32] Now let's put it down here.
[75:35] (soft music)
[75:38] Okay.
[75:39] (soft music)
[75:42] Init boilerplate.
[75:57] (soft music)
[76:01] (soft music)
[76:04] (soft music)
[76:07] (soft music)
[76:10] (soft music)
[76:13] (soft music)
[76:16] (soft music)
[76:19] (soft music)
[76:22] So we're gonna put this PR in both places too.
[76:25] (soft music)
[76:28] (soft music)
[76:31] (soft music)
[76:34] (soft music)
[76:37] (soft music)
[76:40] (soft music)
[76:43] (soft music)
[76:46] (soft music)
[76:49] So are we at five yet?
[76:50] No, fine.
[76:51] So after this is where we'll hard fork
[76:55] and then we'll just do our own thing.
[76:57] But hopefully these five are non-controversial enough
[77:00] that they'll accept them and at least pull them in.
[77:03] And then after that, you know,
[77:06] I don't know, whatever happens, happens.
[77:08] Okay.
[77:09] Add init to just addresses,
[77:14] fixes number.
[77:16] (soft music)
[77:19] (soft music)
[77:22] (soft music)
[77:25] (soft music)
[77:28] (soft music)
[77:31] (soft music)
[77:34] (soft music)
[77:37] (soft music)
[77:40] (soft music)
[77:43] (soft music)
[77:46] (soft music)
[77:49] (soft music)
[77:52] (soft music)
[77:55] This is built on DH,
[77:58] (soft music)
[78:00] H1 through DH4.
[78:03] The relevant commit is,
[78:07] (soft music)
[78:10] (soft music)
[78:13] (soft music)
[78:16] (soft music)
[78:19] (soft music)
[78:22] (soft music)
[78:25] (soft music)
[78:28] (soft music)
[78:31] Okay, cool.
[78:34] (soft music)
[78:37] (soft music)
[78:40] (soft music)
[78:43] (soft music)
[78:46] (soft music)
[78:49] (soft music)
[78:52] (soft music)
[78:55] (soft music)
[78:58] (soft music)
[79:01] (soft music)
[79:04] Does this have other stuff in it?
[79:07] Oh, man, there we go.
[79:10] (soft music)
[79:13] (soft music)
[79:16] Let me go ahead and make sure that we've got that other
[79:19] PR here,
[79:22] which is gonna be,
[79:25] what was it?
[79:28] (soft music)
[79:31] (soft music)
[79:34] Simpler, okay, the bool check thing.
[79:37] Strict bool.
[79:40] (soft music)
[79:43] (soft music)
[79:46] (soft music)
[79:49] (soft music)
[79:52] Okay.
[79:55] (soft music)
[79:58] (soft music)
[80:01] (soft music)
[80:04] (soft music)
[80:07] (soft music)
[80:10] (soft music)
[80:13] (soft music)
[80:16] (soft music)
[80:19] (soft music)
[80:22] (soft music)
[80:25] (soft music)
[80:28] (soft music)
[80:31] (soft music)
[80:34] (soft music)
[80:37] (soft music)
[80:40] So let's go ahead and just refresh this one.
[80:43] (soft music)
[80:46] (soft music)
[80:49] (soft music)
[80:52] And then let me go look
[80:55] what we had here.
[80:58] So that's the usage that would apply.
[81:01] This is our shim. Did I copy in all the pieces of our shim?
[81:04] I believe that I did. Let me make sure I got that all connected.
[81:07] Yeah, I got that all connected. So all of this,
[81:10] (soft music)
[81:13] (soft music)
[81:16] Let's see.
[81:19] (soft music)
[81:22] (soft music)
[81:25] (soft music)
[81:28] Now, what I want to do next is I want to compare that
[81:31] to the actual working code that we have
[81:34] and make sure that it is relatively the same.
[81:37] So I'm going to copy over each of these again
[81:40] and then I'm just going to see if there was any
[81:43] material change.
[81:46] (soft music)
[81:49] Or immaterial changes, any change period.
[81:52] (soft music)
[81:55] (soft music)
[81:58] (soft music)
[82:01] (soft music)
[82:04] (soft music)
[82:07] Any change other than white space.
[82:10] (soft music)
[82:13] (soft music)
[82:16] Because this is presently working
[82:19] so I don't want to break it.
[82:22] (soft music)
[82:25] (soft music)
[82:28] (soft music)
[82:31] (soft music)
[82:34] (soft music)
[82:37] Got sleep, I don't think that changed.
[82:40] (soft music)
[82:43] (soft music)
[82:46] (soft music)
[82:49] (soft music)
[82:52] (soft music)
[82:55] (soft music)
[82:58] (soft music)
[83:01] Okay, so is there any difference to this whatsoever?
[83:04] No, there was not, great.
[83:07] (soft music)
[83:10] (soft music)
[83:13] (soft music)
[83:16] [ Music ]
[83:46] All right.
[83:46] So that's good.
[83:47] So I feel good about that.
[83:48] So we're going to go ahead and do switch to main.
[83:51] And then we'll bring that in.
[84:03] Okay. And at this point, for our purposes --
[84:17] [ Music ]
[84:46] [ Music ]
[85:15] [ Music ]
[85:22] [ Music ]
[85:29] [ Music ]
[85:37] [ Music ]
[85:46] [ Music ]
[85:56] [ Music ]
[86:06] [ Music ]
[86:15] [ Music ]
[86:23] [ Music ]
[86:31] [ Music ]
[86:41] [ Music ]
[86:49] [ Music ]
[86:57] [ Music ]
[87:06] [ Music ]
[87:14] [ Music ]
[87:22] [ Music ]
[87:30] [ Music ]
[87:38] [ Music ]
[87:46] [ Music ]
[88:05] All right.
[88:05] So that's where we need to do our --
[88:07] we need to hard fork right here.
[88:08] So let's go ahead and apply that read me and everything.
[88:13] And we will get this pushed out.
[88:19] [ Music ]
[88:25] [ Music ]
[88:39] This is probably that way because -- let's see.
[88:44] Get rebase abort.
[88:47] [ Music ]
[88:54] Okay. What did we do?
[88:56] [ Music ]
[89:22] [ Music ]
[89:44] [ Music ]
[89:54] [ Music ]
[90:04] [ Music ]
[90:22] Okay. So we do that.
[90:25] [ Music ]
[90:49] Okay.
[90:51] [ Music ]
[91:01] And then we need to make this go into main.
[91:03] [ Music ]
[91:08] All right. There we go.
[91:11] So this is our branding update.
[91:13] [ Music ]
[91:40] And then we should be able to publish this to NPM
[91:43] and should be able to start using it.
[91:45] And I kind of -- yeah, I'm just going to go ahead
[91:48] and get some of those other changes in here, I think.
[91:51] [ Music ]
[92:14] Oh, interesting.
[92:16] [ Music ]
[92:25] [ Music ]
[92:48] Nix async lib in the simplest way.
[92:51] Remove Bluebird.
[92:55] [ Music ]
[93:05] Okay. So this is going to be our --
[93:09] [ Music ]
[93:18] Okay. We're not actually breaking anything at this point.
[93:23] [ Music ]
[93:30] It's okay. We got lots of version numbers.
[93:32] [ Music ]
[93:36] Play you go around.
[93:38] [ Music ]
[94:07] [ Music ]
[94:21] I don't know why that didn't make it in,
[94:25] but I'm just going to leave that one alone for now.
[94:28] [ Music ]
[94:57] [ Music ]
[95:04] Name. Where's the main at?
[95:07] Why is this author crap all the way up there?
[95:11] Put that down at the bottom. That's not important.
[95:13] What's important is what does this thing do?
[95:19] All right. So files are going to be lib index.js.
[95:26] Is there anything else that's necessary in here?
[95:29] Probably. What else we got in lib?
[95:32] [ Music ]
[95:37] Yeah. That one's not necessary.
[95:40] [ Music ]
[96:00] Okay.
[96:02] [ Music ]
[96:12] [ Music ]
[96:22] [ Music ]
[96:32] [ Music ]
[96:42] [ Music ]
[96:52] [ Music ]
[97:02] [ Music ]
[97:22] Okay. So this one is actually super slim.
[97:26] [ Music ]
[97:36] All right. Great.
[97:38] [ Music ]
[98:07] So we're going to call this DH6, I think.
[98:14] [ Music ]
[98:29] [ Music ]
[98:44] [ Music ]
[99:02] All right. So we'll go ahead and run those two past.
[99:12] So git switch main, git rebase, ref.
[99:17] Push. Makes sense.
[99:20] Okay. So we got to just make that PR over here as well real quick.
[99:28] All right. Bluebird.
[99:43] Okay. So that is a minimal change there.
[99:46] [ Music ]
[99:56] Okay. One, two, three. I don't know if that matters.
[100:01.32] Very good. We got that one.
[100:04.32] And then -- okay. So what do we -- so I guess I got to pick one over on this side.
[100:11.32] And I kind of want to pick Nick's async lib in the simplest way.
[100:17.32] Let's see how big of a change this is.
[100:22.32] So a lot of this is actually just -- okay.
[100:25.32] Let's say that we could -- let's do a switch over to this one.
[100:33.32] Git rebase main. Yeah.
[100:48.32] So much of this is damn whitespace crap.
[100:52.32] Okay. Git rebase abort.
[100:56.32] Git rebase -i master.
[101:01.32] Consistent semicolons. Add that. Okay.
[101:05.32] So let's see what we could do in terms of -- I want to make this go cleanly.
[101:15.32] [ Music ]
[101:28.32] Okay. So what we would need is let's just see what we can cherry pick over here.
[101:36.32] [ Music ]
[102:02.32] Okay.
[102:06.32] [ Music ]
[102:31.32] All right. And this is where I think we get into trouble.
[102:35.32] [ Music ]
[102:48.32] All right. So we are going to go to --
[102:51.32] [ Music ]
[103:20.32] Okay. Git rebase.
[103:24.32] [ Music ]
[103:53.32] Okay.
[104:20.32] Async or bluebird. Good. That's a good one.
[104:25.32] [ Music ]
[104:54.32] Okay. So actually let me go back.
[105:06.32] Question is do I want to use the simpler one?
[105:09.32] Let's see what the diff looks like.
[105:17.32] Oh, wow. That's very simple.
[105:20.32] Very, very, very simple.
[105:24.32] [ Music ]
[105:48.32] [ Music ]
[106:13.32] Oh, okay. I see. I see why that was used that way.
[106:16.32] Okay. Yeah. That's very, very simple.
[106:18.32] That's very, very easy to reason about and understand.
[106:22.32] So let's call that DH7.
[106:39.32] All right. So that's where we hard fork.
[106:46.32] I'm just going to double check something here.
[106:57.32] I want to see what this looks like if we gave -- let's call this DH7A.
[107:20.32] Because I think essentially we just add another file here.
[107:23.32] And this looks like it's a lot of changes, but I don't think it's actually a lot of changes.
[107:26.32] I think that it looks like a lot of changes.
[107:40.32] Because -- let me go back to this other one here.
[107:49.32] We need to go to about right here.
[107:56.32] And we should be able to rebase everything. Yep.
[107:58.32] Okay. So then we run npm run thumped.
[108:04.32] And we apply that --
[108:15.32] here.
[108:44.32] Okay. So if we do it that way, do npm run thumped.
[108:58.32] Put that in. Okay.
[109:01.32] Then if we rebase onto the Bluebird one, we should have almost no conflicts.
[109:14.32] Conflicts look like they're going to be pretty silly.
[109:27.32] Okay. I just put sleep down here.
[109:41.32] And then package.json -- yeah, it's just going to be -- get rid of those dependencies.
[110:00.32] Continue. All right.
[110:07.32] All right. Yeah.
[110:12.32] I got sucked down a different rabbit hole.
[110:41.32] Let's see.
[111:07.32] This now builds on other PRs.
[111:16.32] The relevant commit is -- okay.
[111:21.32] So let's take a look at just this one commit and let's see how much of a pita that is.
[111:26.32] I mean, that's not bad.
[111:28.32] So, yeah, I mean, this one I know it's well tested.
[111:36.32] So I don't know.
[111:38.32] I think for our purposes we'll just stick to the one that's simpler and then I'll reference this one as, hey, this is what we could have done.
[111:51.32] But I think -- yeah, I think I'm just going to go with the simpler one because it's simpler.
[111:55.32] I don't know. I don't know.
[111:58.32] Yeah, I think I just -- in general I feel better about that.
[112:01.32] If we have performance issues, we can come back to it.
[112:04.32] That's what -- I'm going to take the simple route.
[112:07.32] If we have performance issues, we'll come back to it.
[112:10.32] But here we go.
[112:13.32] So what we're going to do to our own repository and we're going to be looking at async simple.
[112:29.32] Create pull request as mentioned in blank.
[112:50.32] I think this was it, right?
[113:09.32] I know what I'm going to do.
[113:11.32] I know how I'm going to handle this situation in the cleanest way possible.
[113:20.32] Okay. So let me go back here.
[113:23.32] Oh, look at this one. Dang it, where did mine go?
[113:51.32] Okay. What is this?
[114:01.32] All right. I may need to take a break and go spend some time with my son.
[114:13.32] All right.
[114:17.32] So we're doing it the simple way, but here's how --
[114:26.32] I'm going to layer the commit and just leave the commit aside.
[114:51.32] So here's how I do it.
[114:54.32] I'm actually going to --
[115:03.32] I'm going to git log.
[115:24.32] And look at this.
[115:37.32] Yeah, I promise if I definitely should have gone on the bottom.
[115:46.32] Hold on.
[115:58.32] Okay. We're going to do -- where did it go?
[116:26.32] Wait, I'm going to do it slightly differently.
[116:41.32] Git switch main, npm run fmt.
[116:45.32] This should not be controversial. Right? Okay.
[116:48.32] Git switch, nix, async, parallel, npm run fmt.
[117:05.32] Okay.
[117:34.32] Okay.
[117:59.32] Now I think I feel good about this one.
[118:06.32] We can leave that promisify up top for stupid.
[118:15.32] Just so there's fewer things to look at.
[118:17.32] Okay.
[118:37.32] Okay.
[119:05.32] Boom. Okay. Cool.
[119:16.32] And there we go.
[119:20.32] So now this is just seven.
[119:25.32] And that one is a possible eight.
[119:54.32] Okay.
[120:01.32] So I just need to make sure that the relevant commits in both of those are still accurate so they can look at them if they want to.
[120:08.32] And then that's it. Now we're going to leave -DRPC behind. We've got our own.
[120:21.32] Okay.
[120:31.32] All right. 7F is what that is.
[120:49.32] Okay.
[121:00.32] Oh, interesting.
[121:02.32] Okay. So I will reopen this one, I guess.
[121:17.32] Oh, weird. Oh, no.
[121:19.32] So this lost its -- it lost its extra commit or something?
[121:23.32] I don't know what happened there.
[121:25.32] Okay. I guess I'll have to push -- open that one up again.
[121:35.32] Oh, whatever.
[121:43.32] Okay. And then that will be that.
[121:45.32] And then we're going to leave -DRPC behind. We're going to go our own way.
[121:53.32] But if they want to follow us, they've got the trail to do what they need to do.
[122:00.32] Okay.
[122:29.32] Oh, our request was processed. Okay. We're no longer a fork.
[122:33.32] Oh, interesting.
[122:49.32] Oh, I hope that didn't close out all of the PRs.
[122:55.32] It may have.
[123:09.32] Oh, that's kind of weird.
[123:11.32] I wonder if I can --
[123:16.32] Can I still have that work?
[123:38.32] Let me try that one more time.
[124:07.32] Okay, -pay -DRPC compare master to -hive -rpc.js.
[124:31.32] May, let's say.
[124:33.32] Let me do this.
[124:35.32] Okay, yeah.
[124:56.32] Okay.
[125:25.32] Let's try that. Let's see what this does.
[125:46.32] I'm confused. Why --
[126:11.32] I don't know. Okay.
[126:15.32] I'll just --
[126:17.32] I'll just --
[126:19.32] Okay.
[126:48.32] Okay, cool.
[126:56.32] So I can open that back up over there.
[127:01.32] And then now we are --
[127:05.32] It's hard fork time.
[127:08.32] It's hard forking time.
[127:19.32] Okay.
[127:25.32] Get, switch, hard fork, get, rebase.
[127:29.32] May?
[127:38.32] Let's just call it 19-0-0.
[127:45.32] And let's figure out how to fix this promise thing.
[127:54.32] Okay, so --
[127:56.32] Okay.
[128:00.32] Okay.
[128:02.32] Okay.
[128:30.32] Okay.
[128:49.32] Okay.
[129:10.32] Okay.
[129:36.32] Okay.
[129:42.32] What was the version at before?
[129:45.32] We're going to leave that right there.
[129:49.32] Okay.
[130:08.32] All right, and then we just need to --
[130:14.32] Okay.
[130:20.32] I'm also -- I'm going to move all of this crap down towards the --
[130:25.32] All right, we don't need the author. We don't really need, you know --
[130:30.32] What does it look like in the other projects?
[130:33.32] Let me just check this out real quick.
[130:35.32] Where's all that stuff there?
[130:37.32] Is that really crowding up this space? No.
[130:39.32] Name, version, description, main browser, repository, license.
[130:42.32] Keywords comes after license.
[130:44.32] Do we have, like, an author field or -- no.
[130:48.32] Okay, good.
[130:49.32] We just don't have that nonsense over here.
[130:52.32] Okay, well, let's move the nonsense around a little bit.
[130:56.32] Let's take the nonsense down past --
[131:04.32] I mean, that's really down in the license territory or something.
[131:07.32] I don't know.
[131:12.32] Let's move that.
[131:19.32] Let's make this just super easy to read.
[131:21.32] Name, description, home page, repository, license.
[131:27.32] We can put that down towards the bottom here.
[131:33.32] Yeah, just put it at the bottom.
[131:44.32] Hold on.
[131:45.32] What's a brand-new one look like?
[131:48.32] Mkdir foo, npm init -y.
[131:55.32] Okay, all right, this is what it shows.
[131:57.32] So let me make sure that it's roughly in that position.
[132:02.32] So name, that's important.
[132:05.32] Version's important.
[132:06.32] Description.
[132:08.32] Then we got the main.
[132:09.32] That makes sense.
[132:11.32] Then we've got scripts.
[132:14.32] We should have files.
[132:16.32] Files.
[132:19.32] Files is going to be promise.js and libindex.js for right now.
[132:28.32] Okay, and then we should have scripts.
[132:39.32] And then there's keywords, home page, all that other stuff, right?
[132:52.32] Dependencies goes down there, yeah.
[133:15.32] Okay.
[133:16.32] So the way that it officially does it,
[133:19.32] it doesn't even show home page and all that stuff.
[133:23.32] All right, let me try one other thing real quick.
[133:28.32] Let's say, let's just move package.json to package.json.back, sure, yeah.
[133:35.32] And then let's do npm init and see what it comes up with.
[133:44.32] Name, version, description, test command, get repository, keywords, license.
[133:54.32] Okay, so it does.
[133:58.32] Holy shiz dog.
[134:01.32] Holy shiz dog.
[134:04.32] All right, so I just, I know this is pathetic, but okay.
[134:07.32] Name, version, description, main, directories.
[134:10.32] Okay, interesting.
[134:11.32] Dependencies, that's way too big.
[134:15.32] But we're doing files, not directories.
[134:17.32] Dem dependencies, scripts, scripts down the bottom, that's way too low.
[134:20.32] So repository, keywords, author, license.
[134:23.32] Okay, so we're going to do back.
[134:31.32] Repository, keywords, author, license.
[134:34.32] Repository, keywords, author.
[134:49.32] We don't have bugs.
[134:51.32] Let's get rid of it.
[134:58.32] So it doesn't look like it does home page.
[135:01.32] I don't know, do we want bugs?
[135:03.32] Maybe we do want bugs.
[135:04.32] I don't know.
[135:11.32] All right, I'm going to let that one go.
[135:14.32] I'll throw this down.
[135:15.32] No, repository, license, bugs, author.
[135:20.32] Yeah, okay, that's good.
[135:22.32] That's good.
[135:23.32] I just, I'm going to run npm install.
[135:26.32] Let it do its thing.
[135:32.32] Going to get rid of some of these.
[135:33.32] We don't need that.
[135:34.32] We don't need that.
[135:36.32] Right now, we don't need that.
[135:38.32] I'm going to get rid of it.
[135:39.32] This one can go up top.
[135:41.32] I am going to add the bump script.
[135:43.32] Well, I'll add the bump script in just a second.
[135:45.32] We're going to leave that one alone for now.
[135:46.32] Okay, so I know it's stupid.
[135:51.32] I just want it to be in a consistent order.
[136:13.32] Oops.
[136:21.32] Okay, now we'll add the bump script.
[136:30.32] Oh, whoops.
[136:34.32] Oh, right, okay.
[137:03.32] Okay, got it.
[137:16.32] I'm going to move this one up.
[137:27.32] Npm run bump major.
[137:36.32] Npm git push tags git push.
[137:42.32] Npm publish access public.
[137:46.32] Wait.
[137:47.32] Oh, okay, we can fix that later.
[137:54.32] Oh, and I've got to plug in my security key and touch it.
[138:19.32] All right, there it is.
[138:23.32] There it is.
[138:25.32] There it is.
[138:34.32] There it is.
[139:03.32] All right.
[139:06.32] Cool, so now let me switch over to this.
[139:09.32] And again, I wasn't planning to do this, but here it is.
[139:34.32] All right.
[140:02.32] Cool.
[140:07.32] All right.
[140:10.32] Cool.
[140:13.32] All right.
[140:16.32] Cool.
[140:26.32] All right.
[140:36.32] Check out that branch.
[140:50.32] And then notify.
[141:11.32] I didn't mean to, I didn't want to close that.
[141:13.32] Why did that get closed?
[141:15.32] I didn't close that.
[141:18.32] I pushed to it and then it closed itself.
[141:20.32] That doesn't make sense.
[141:22.32] But whatever.
[141:46.32] Okay.
[141:49.32] Cool.
[141:53.32] Cool.
[141:56.32] All right.
[141:58.32] Cool.
[142:00.32] All right.
[142:05.32] Cool.
[142:07.32] All right.
[142:17.32] Cool.
[142:27.32] Cool.
[142:55.32] Okay.
[143:04.32] Wait, what happened?
[143:10.32] Dash RPC.
[143:23.32] Oops.
[143:25.32] Okay.
[143:30.32] Cool.
[143:32.32] All right.
[143:35.32] Cool.
[143:48.32] Okay.
[144:14.32] All right, now let's go make sure that it works.
[144:16.32] We'll probably have to do a patch update because there's probably something broken.
[144:20.32] But now don't have to maintain all these shams.
[144:24.32] Just get rid of it.
[144:35.32] And then where did our RPC go?
[144:38.32] I just do dash RPC.
[144:43.32] Should be as simple as that.
[144:45.32] We don't need a sham.
[144:52.32] NPM install save dash RPC.
[145:06.32] And I don't know, do we have a div dependency on Mocha?
[145:09.32] I guess we do.
[145:17.32] Okay.
[145:18.32] So let's make sure this thing still works.
[145:20.32] Up to the point that it's been working at least.
[145:27.32] Of course it's broken.
[145:28.32] Of course.
[145:36.32] I'm not surprised.
[145:39.32] Network.
[145:41.32] Oh, is this because of changes I was making?
[145:46.32] Okay, RPC client connected chosen Evo node.
[145:49.32] Okay, so it's working.
[145:51.32] All right, cool.
[145:59.32] All right, so I'll just plop this over here.
[146:05.32] FYI, we've got an updated actively maintained fork.
[146:34.32] Okay.
[146:36.32] All right.
[146:38.32] All right.
[146:39.32] Cool.
[146:40.32] All right.
[146:42.32] All right.
[146:46.32] All right.
[146:50.32] All right.
[146:54.32] All right.
[146:57.32] All right.
[147:01.32] All right.
[147:04.32] All right.
[147:07.32] All right.
[147:10.32] All right.
[147:13.32] All right.
[147:29.32] All right.
[147:56.32] All right, I'm getting out of here.
[148:10.32] Oh wait, which one was this?
[148:25.32] Oh, this is not updated, right?
[148:29.32] Okay.
[148:30.32] All right, and I'll let Jojo know that we've got that.
[148:36.32] Let me double check.
[148:45.32] Okay.
[149:10.32] Oh, hey everybody.
[149:11.32] How's it going?
[149:12.32] Good to see everybody drop in.
[149:14.32] Hey, everybody.
[149:15.32] How's it going?
