[00:00] - We are live, hello Rion, ready for some fun debugging? - Yeah, I mean, I wish we weren't debugging,
[00:10] but here we are, might as well do something. - Yeah, yeah, so where we're at right now
[00:18] for anyone who's been following along with the streams is last time we were kind of walking you through
[00:24] the tutorial that I've built out, which gets you to create a wallet
[00:29] and then get some test funds in that wallet. And then when we are trying to create an identity,
[00:34] we're hitting a bit of an error. And actually I would love to just get your explanation
[00:40] of what is the difference between a wallet and an identity and an address?
[00:44] Those are three things that I think could be a bit confusing especially for people who've been in the blockchain world
[00:49] and may have certain ideas of what those words mean in a separate context.
[00:54] - Yeah, so I'll back up even further. For anyone's sake who isn't already familiar with this.
[01:02] So in Dash, we have two blockchains. We have the core blockchain,
[01:10] which we sometimes call the payments chain. That's a proof of work chain.
[01:14] That's, everybody pretty much understands that. And then we also--
[01:21] - That is what is creating the currency itself. We have different computers that are mining coins,
[01:28] which is like running a math to basically get the coin. And then that gets dispersed to the people
[01:32] who then use that as currency. Anyone who knows anything about cryptocurrency
[01:36] should understand how that works. - Yep, yeah.
[01:39] And then in addition to the proof of work chain, we also have a proof of stake chain.
[01:48] And it is based on the Tendermint protocol. Client, the Tendermint consensus algorithm.
[01:58] - Yeah, and the proof of stake is people who already have some money in the currency
[02:04] can basically lock that up for a certain period of time. So then use that to validate.
[02:09] So that removes the need to mine. Although it sounds like Dash has a combination of the two.
[02:15] - Yeah, and the reason that's important is none of our, so if you know about Dash already
[02:22] or have interacted with it in the past 10 years, all you really know is the proof of work chain.
[02:30] The proof of stake chain is an addition. Well, let's call it a side chain.
[02:34] There are different people, different camps with different terminology,
[02:37] but I'm gonna call it a side chain. And that's really only running on test net right now
[02:43] and development networks. So there's no proof of stake, anything.
[02:50] So this is all development stuff. And so we are running the proof of stake side chain
[02:58] on our test net. And sometimes it's up, sometimes it's not.
[03:03] Sometimes the test net is, typically the test net is working
[03:08] for the proof of work chain, the payments chain. But sometimes the test net chain is down.
[03:14] So actually, let me just, let me see if I have the status.
[03:20] Status. Okay, I don't have it in my search history.
[03:24] So let me, I'm going to Discord and I'm going to the test net channel.
[03:30] If you don't already know about this, Anthony, it'd be good for you to know.
[03:35] - Let's pull this up and I'll share my screen for this. And yeah, the test net channel
[03:39] is what I was debugging it for last. - Yeah, yeah, so we might as well,
[03:42] yeah, bring that up onto that screen so that people can see
[03:45] what we've been chatting about already. - Yes.
[03:49] - Okay. Okay, yeah, so this is what we kind of
[03:55] have been walking through. So I had originally been hitting an error.
[04:01] So I first had an error because we weren't on the most recent version
[04:06] of the package. So I updated that.
[04:09] And then there was kind of an issue about synchronizing at the right block height.
[04:16] So we went through that. And then this is what we're currently stuck on,
[04:18] which is what we hit in the stream yesterday, I'm pretty sure.
[04:22] ECDSA signing error signature failed verification. - Yeah, and what I was gonna bring you here for,
[04:30] before we get too much into that weeds, 'cause I'm still kind of in intro mode.
[04:33] - Yeah. - Go, click the top of the test net channel
[04:38] for the channel description. And you'll see, not there, in the, yeah, there you go.
[04:45] - Wait, hold on. - Click that, so that opens up.
[04:49] - Yeah, I used to be so fluent at Discord. - Okay, so here's some useful links
[04:54] when dealing with test net stuff, which is what we're dealing with right now.
[04:57] So we've got the docs there, open that in a new tab, go back to Discord now.
[05:04] - It is, okay, yeah, so this goes back to the docs.dash.org, that's what I was, yeah.
[05:11] - And then, so when I was talking about, we have two blockchains, this is what I mean.
[05:15] We have the, there's an explorer for both of these chains. So if you open, go ahead and open all these links.
[05:23] - Okay. - And we'll just talk about it real briefly.
[05:25] - Yeah, so ones we were on last time, we were messing around with Fawcett last time,
[05:29] so that one should be familiar to people. And, oh, looks like there is something going on.
[05:35] - Yeah, so this is the one that I was gonna bring up just for the sake of explanation.
[05:41] 'Cause this is dash testnet, go back. - Okay, no, it's too unstable.
[05:47] Oh, this was, hold on, this is November 18th, though. Does that mean it's been going on for four months?
[05:55] - I don't exactly know. What I'll say about this site is that it's manually updated,
[06:02] but what I wanted to use it for right now is-- - Yeah, the most recent ones are all from November.
[06:08] - Yeah, so you can see the major categories. You could go a little slower if you would.
[06:13] So dash testnet, this is a network, and the network has nodes.
[06:19] And those nodes are running different software. Part of that software that they're running,
[06:25] you could categorize under dash core. That's what I was talking about
[06:28] with the proof of work chain. And you can see under dash core,
[06:32] there are several subcategories, dash general core, instance end.
[06:36] These are features of core, and whether certain features are working or not.
[06:41] So according to this status page, everything on core in the testnet environment,
[06:47] a network, is functioning. Now on the dash platform, you can scroll that a bit further.
[06:53] - Are these just like incorrect dates then? - I haven't really even thought about that yet,
[07:01] but I'm still in the dash platform, explaining the different high level.
[07:07] Okay, so dash platform is a different blockchain. But the same nodes, or actually a subset of the nodes
[07:17] that run the dash core chain, are running the platform chain.
[07:22] So only a subset. And it's actually a subset of a subset.
[07:26] So in dash, we have what are called master nodes, and master nodes are a subset of all of the nodes
[07:33] that run the dash core software. So anybody can run dash core,
[07:37] both on testnet and on mainnet. But if you're doing that, then there's no requirement.
[07:46] There's no stake requirement to run what you might call a validator in other networks.
[07:52] And typically in proof of stake systems, the nodes are called validator nodes,
[08:00] because they're not mining necessarily. They are creating coins sometimes.
[08:06] That depends on the mission schedule. But in any case, they are required to have a certain stake
[08:13] to be a valid validator. You have to have, that's why it's called proof of stake.
[08:18] Now in dash, you have that superset of node operators running the dash core software.
[08:27] And then a subset of that is what are called master nodes. And these master nodes, still proof of work,
[08:34] consensus algorithm, but if you're a master node, you have to have 1000 dash, either on mainnet or testnet.
[08:42] It's easy to get testnet 1000, obviously. On mainnet, it's more expensive,
[08:46] and that's part of the security model. And then these master nodes are running different services.
[08:51] So if you scroll up a little bit, I can talk about those services.
[08:55] The general core, anybody can run that. Instant send, chain locks, and LLMQ components,
[09:04] those are all master node features. So master nodes are what provides the instant send feature
[09:10] and the chain locks feature. - So it sounds like you can kind of think of those
[09:14] as like higher level APIs that are providing developer functionality.
[09:18] - They're not higher level API. I wouldn't call them a high level API,
[09:25] but the master nodes, they are considered to have more authority
[09:31] on the chain, for example. And when they get together in these quorums,
[09:37] so you'll see LLMQ, that stands for Long Living Master Node Quorum.
[09:42] So that's even further subset of the master nodes. There's different quorums operating.
[09:47] - Okay, can I ask a more general question then? So would the chain function at all without all of these?
[09:56] Were these all required to get the whole system to work? - The chain can function without these features.
[10:03] So sometimes you'll see like instant locks are, instant send locks are failing.
[10:09] In other words, for whatever reason, the master node quorums aren't coming to consensus
[10:14] about whether a transaction should be considered solidified and un-reversible, irreversible.
[10:21] And that would be a scenario where blocks can still be produced
[10:27] and considered valid by normal nodes on the network. But there is something that,
[10:36] there is a certain flag that's not set if the instant send feature is not running.
[10:42] Same thing with chain locks. Chain locks, instant send is what secures transactions
[10:48] and where you see a transaction on the network in the mem pool, in the memory pool.
[10:54] And if that transaction has an instant send lock on it, that means even though this isn't in a block yet,
[11:01] this transaction, the network considers this transaction to be secure and finalized, settled.
[11:09] You will not be able to spend the inputs that are spending, that are used in this transaction
[11:14] for another transaction. So that secures transactions.
[11:19] Chain locks is different. Chain locks secures blocks of transactions.
[11:24] So it's locking the chain and saying, instead of looking at transactions in the memory pool,
[11:30] it's looking at blocks in the blockchain and saying, hey, we just, the miner just created,
[11:34] miners just created a block and we all see this block and we consider this block to be the canonical valid block
[11:44] for this given height in the blockchain. And if another block comes around and says,
[11:51] I won't get into the details, but it's essentially saying we can't reorganize the chain
[11:59] and have a different block at say block height. I don't even know what the numbers are,
[12:05] 500,000 or a million or 2 million or whatever the block height is.
[12:09] This is the valid block for this block height and it cannot be reorganized.
[12:15] So that's what instance send and chain locks are. Again, just a quick recap.
[12:20] Instance send validates and settles transactions and then chain locks validates
[12:27] and settles blocks of transactions. And these are features that we have in Dash
[12:33] and have had in Dash for a long time, thanks to master nodes.
[12:37] Master nodes being quasi proof of stake because you have to have 1000 Dash to run a master node
[12:44] and then be part of these quorums that do these locks and whatnot.
[12:49] So now if we go back down to the Dash platform side, again, this is, we're still,
[12:54] now I'm talking again about the testnet network. This platform is not on mainnet, never has been.
[13:01] We're hoping that that will be on mainnet this year, but right now it's only on testnet.
[13:10] And as you can see-- - It gives you nine months to figure it out, nice.
[13:13] - Yeah, well, I mean, we've been saying this for years. - I just always think it's funny.
[13:17] Like, you know, I've done open source stuff. I remember with Redwood, it was always like,
[13:21] when's V1 coming? And we would give like, you know,
[13:23] a vague time in the future and then hope we got there roughly when we said we did.
[13:29] So I get it. - Okay, so back to my superset, subset, sub, sub, subset
[13:34] thing where we have nodes on the network, servers on the network.
[13:41] You have the biggest set is the set of people running dash core.
[13:45] And then you have a subset of master nodes and master nodes can be running dash core.
[13:52] And a subset of master nodes would be a master node quorum. And those are what kind of dictate what's happening
[14:02] with different features like instance and chain locks. And platform dash platform is run by a subset
[14:12] of the master nodes called Evo nodes. And Evo nodes evolution is the name for the Evo.
[14:20] That's where that comes from. Evo nodes are like master nodes,
[14:24] but instead of just running the core services, they're also running platform services.
[14:29] They require a 4,000 dash stake. So not increased from 1000 to 4,000 dash stake
[14:37] or collateral as it's called sometimes. And then they run all the components of dash platform.
[14:43] So you can see dash platform has several components, drive, DAPI.
[14:47] - And DAPI is something that, that's a term that I saw a lot as I was going through
[14:53] the docs to create this. And that's the, do you remember what DAPI stands for?
[14:59] - Decentralized API. - That's right, yeah.
[15:02] - Or dash. - Are there places in the docs that we should be going to
[15:05] while we're like running through this stuff? 'Cause like, here's like at this point,
[15:08] better visualization of what we're looking at right now. - Yep.
[15:12] - Yeah. - Yep. - Yeah, okay.
[15:14] So I didn't really necessarily mean to get into all the architectural side.
[15:19] - No, this is good. This is good 'cause this is stuff I didn't really know.
[15:23] So that was a great like primer for me for sure. And so I guess,
[15:27] what does this have to do with the error I'm seeing? - Yeah, so it was important.
[15:32] It is important to know that there are these two different chains going on.
[15:35] If you don't know that, then you're gonna be totally confused
[15:37] when you're doing - Absolutely, yeah. - Dash platform development.
[15:40] Because when you - What's been useful for me though is I don't think I've ever worked with main net.
[15:45] 'Cause basically you started me off with dash platform and it was like run from here.
[15:50] So I've only ever existed in this world. So I didn't even know there was a whole,
[15:53] like I knew there was because I've been paid in dash obviously and I own dash.
[15:57] So I knew there was a separation there vaguely in my head. So this is a good explanation of
[16:02] where that separation actually exists. - Yeah, yeah.
[16:06] So I don't know exactly what question got this line of thinking started,
[16:10] but you asked a question. Can you, do you remember what it was?
[16:12] And maybe we can circle back to it at this point. - Sure.
[16:16] Well, basically it was like, what does the error I'm seeing mean?
[16:20] Was kind of the main question, I guess for me. So just to give people,
[16:25] I have a little repro here of what's going on. The actual function we're trying to run as you're trying.
[16:32] Oh wait, sorry. I do remember now.
[16:34] I was asking what the difference between a wallet and an address and an identity is.
[16:38] - Exactly, okay. - Yeah.
[16:40] - So wallet is a bit of an ambiguous term. You'll get different answers from different people,
[16:44] but from my perspective, and since the industry has already moved this way
[16:48] for the most part, a wallet is the 12 word phrase
[16:52] that generates a hierarchy of addresses. - Yeah.
[17:00] - And so that's two of those terms. Wallet, I consider the 12 word phrase
[17:05] that can generate lots of different public private key pairs,
[17:09] including addresses, which is the hash of a public key.
[17:13] - And so that's where we started with. We start with running this create wallet function,
[17:18] which gives you a mnemonic and an address. And so the mnemonic is the wallet,
[17:22] which is what you're referring to right now. - Yes.
[17:24] And then there's the address. The identity thing is the thing that got me
[17:28] going into the big architectural sub explanation. - Yeah, so it says that they serve as the basis
[17:35] for interactions with Dash platforms. So do identities exist outside of Dash platform?
[17:42] - No. - Okay, now I see why you need to go,
[17:46] go through that whole thing. Sorry, what were you saying?
[17:49] - Yeah, identities are a Dash platform primitive. It is the basis of all work on Dash platform.
[17:57] So if you, if you want to participate in Dash platform, one of the first things you have to do is give yourself,
[18:05] have the network give you an identity. And that's what these RPCs are doing in, let's see,
[18:12] in this clip. Yeah, client.platform.identities.register is,
[18:18] and when it says client, so what is client? Client is the thing that's contacting
[18:24] with its configuration, contacting Dash platform nodes. - And let me actually, real quick,
[18:31] let me go to my tutorial, because I have an example of what it spits out when this actually does run.
[18:42] So we have-- - And while you're saying that,
[18:44] I have to correct something that I said. I said client was something that contacts
[18:48] the Dash platform nodes. It's actually, that was actually probably one level deeper.
[18:52] The client actually can do, can request information from the core blockchain as well.
[19:00] So that's why there was that sub, that sub namespace of client.platform.
[19:07] And client.platform is what's giving you the options of the other things.
[19:14] Okay, so-- - Yeah, so this is my code here.
[19:16] It's basically the same. It's just slightly destructured differently.
[19:21] But when you run it and it works, what you get is this identity ID,
[19:25] which is just a bunch of random characters, basically. - And so this is what we're looking at right here
[19:31] is our work from several months ago, like maybe almost a year ago.
[19:36] You did-- - Yeah, this was--
[19:38] - You pasted in-- - Yeah, yeah.
[19:41] - So this was working code. And what we're doing now, high level,
[19:44] is we're kind of going back to this. You didn't have the tutorial completely written,
[19:50] or at least published. - It wasn't completely written,
[19:53] but up to this point, it was working. So it's like, that's why you can see here,
[19:56] I was able to get an identity ID, which then was able to get me to creating
[20:01] all the other stuff. Like you eventually, then you register a name.
[20:05] And then at that point, I had actually created one. The retrieve name one, I never got working,
[20:10] but that's a separate matter. So basically, I had got it working
[20:14] all the way up to the point I had a name create, like it was AJC web dev test or something.
[20:20] So this code was working at some point. And then I just got this repro spun up,
[20:27] and I literally just copy pasted the exact code that was in the register and identity here.
[20:32] So basically, this sounds like you need to bump this upstream to see kind of what the error is.
[20:39] 'Cause as it's written in the docs, I'm currently trying and still hitting that error.
[20:43] - Yeah, okay. So at this point, yeah, we're now at the point
[20:47] where we've described the context, and we're trying to get the tutorial
[20:54] back to a working condition with, there's been lots of changes for dash platform
[21:01] since this tutorial was originally written. So we're trying to get it to work again.
[21:06] And I personally, my goal is that the docs always work in a absolute don't make me think way.
[21:14] And so if something's not documented, we need to make an issue for that.
[21:20] And my first question is, do we need to, if we scroll up to the top or to the beginning
[21:29] of this tutorial on dash.org, does it document the minimum requirements?
[21:34] And do we meet those minimum requirements for the version of node that we're running?
[21:40] So it looks like it does require node version 20. So that's my first question is,
[21:45] are you running node version 20? - Yeah, 20.12.0.
[21:49] - Okay. So that's met, the dash JavaScript SDK.
[21:55] - That's what we're going back and forth with to make sure we're on the right version.
[22:00] So right now I had originally been trying on three dot whatever, but now this is run 4.0.0 dev dot nine,
[22:08] which is the most recent. - This is the latest release that I know of.
[22:10] - That's the latest thing, yeah. - There may be other, I'm looking at my GitHub
[22:16] notifications just to make sure. That does look like the latest release.
[22:24] - And actually it has it, the way it's written here, I just want to see what this is actually doing
[22:29] because I didn't run it like this. So if I were to remove this dependency
[22:33] and then install it like this, let's see what happens. - Let's see what happens.
[22:38] 'Cause that, you had a dot nine there and who knows if that's...
[22:44] - I think what this is going to do is this is kind of like running at latest, but they have it in their own
[22:51] kind of weird bespoke way. So yes, that is like running at latest
[22:55] and it just gives me exactly what I already had there. So that's good, nothing wrong there.
[23:00] - Yep. - I guess the only thing that might be different
[23:04] is I have ESM instead of require. So I guess I should probably get that changed
[23:11] just so we're absolutely line for line exactly the same. - Yep.
[23:15] Yeah, do you know offhand what version of Node gave ESM support?
[23:26] - A long time ago, either 16 or 18 for sure. So that's not an error, that's not necessarily an issue.
[23:34] But let's-- - The thing that happens is it makes like,
[23:36] so I have to go back and now remove type module from my package.json for this to actually work.
[23:43] And-- - While you're doing that,
[23:45] I'm going to go get a drink of water, so-- - Yeah, I need to get .env back in ESM version,
[23:52] which I haven't done in a while. Okay.
[23:57] (door slams) I believe it's going to be this,
[24:09] require.env.config instead of that. Worst comes to worst, I can go off screen
[24:20] and just hard code the numbers as well. Let me close all these up.
[24:26] Okay. Okay, that should be good.
[24:42] And then now this needs to be. Ooh, let's see.
[24:47] Hold on, I know what to do now. (keyboard clicking)
[24:54] I'm going to hop off screen just real quick 'cause I wanna get my chat GPT up
[25:00] and wanna make sure my message history is not showing. - Okay.
[25:05] - Okay, that's good. - Yeah, I'm hoping this gives us the same error
[25:11] because that would be-- - It should, yeah.
[25:13] - It's surprising to me that the import syntax would change the functionality.
[25:19] - Yeah, it definitely should not. So this is probably, it's a good thing to find out.
[25:23] - And if so, you know, part of what we could do either off stream or on stream is update the docs
[25:30] because, you tell me-- - It would be nice to get them in ESM, yeah.
[25:35] - Yeah, it seems like the industry has moved on from require syntax.
[25:41] - They're trying their damn hardest when they put it that way.
[25:44] (laughing) Okay.
[25:50] I think that is all. Let's just see what happens now when we run this guy.
[25:56] Oh yeah, that was, so let me make sure-- - It changes a lot, doesn't it?
[26:10] - Corrects my work over here as well. Yeah, it's the, 'cause you have the imports and the exports.
[26:14] So I, it's just, I haven't done this conversion backwards in so long, I've always done it forwards, you know?
[26:21] (laughing) - And we're on step one of the dash.org tutorial, right?
[26:30] So it might make sense to just like copy it straight up exactly from the dash documentation.
[26:39] - Yeah, the, yeah, so I guess the big, the difference is you don't have a separate client file.
[26:48] So let me go ahead and do that. So I need to go to here and register.
[26:56] Yeah, so I'll just copy this whole thing. And then I could run it actually hard-coded,
[27:10] but I feel like I probably should do that off-screen so no one messes with it, 'cause you gave me,
[27:17] you gave me so much test dash. I feel like it's valuable now.
[27:20] (laughing) - I mean, I'd like to think nobody's stealing testnet coins.
[27:27] That's silly, but. - Right.
[27:31] Yeah, let me just, real quick, I will pop it in and just like scroll, scroll down just so
[27:39] no one messes with it. (mumbling)
[27:45] Okay. So now I'm running it and we will see what happens.
[28:13] (mouse clicking) Drum roll.
[28:26] (keyboard clacking) (mouse clicking)
[28:34] - Do you want to drop a link to the tutorial in the chat just so that people can?
[28:52] - Sure. - Both the dash.org one and your GitHub one.
[28:58] (mouse clicking) Ooh, that's an interesting one.
[29:12] It's now slightly different. Header metadata was not found
[29:19] during the Merkle block processing. That is not an error I've seen at any point
[29:24] that we've been doing this. (laughing)
[29:26] So maybe, kicking back to require, did do something different.
[29:30] - Let's see. Okay, so-- - What's your thoughts?
[29:44] - That is interesting. That is really interesting.
[29:48] (laughing) Oops.
[29:56] - I'm also just playing around with the StreamYard thing. Let's see, copy.
[30:03] Okay, so now I'm finally getting around to looking at this error here.
[30:13] - Oh, let me actually, hold on. I think I did something wrong, I think.
[30:20] 'Cause I think I only halfway did the environment variables. Or, no, actually, no, it says test it here.
[30:26] Okay, nevermind, that's not what I thought it was. Okay, so yeah, I'm not sure.
[30:30] - Okay, let's look at the screen again. - Yeah.
[30:36] So, my first thought always is just see what ChachiPT has to say about it.
[30:50] Usually with very bespoke errors like this that are specific to a project,
[30:56] it doesn't really know what to do. But it might give us some useful insight.
[31:02] - My first inclination is to read it. (laughing)
[31:07] Let's see if that-- - I did read it, now I know what it means.
[31:09] So, I've already read it. (laughing)
[31:13] - I just, I hadn't, but I trust that you have. - That header, so I guess the question would be,
[31:19] what does the header metadata have to do with the Merkle block processing?
[31:23] Which is a question I cannot possibly answer with my current knowledge of the chain.
[31:28] - Let's see, well, where is it coming from? What? - So, it's just coming
[31:36] from trying to run create identity. - No, I mean, so wallet live,
[31:42] I'm just looking at the stack trace. - Yeah, gotcha.
[31:49] - GRPC looks like. This I've seen, I've seen GRPC errors a lot,
[31:58] more than I'd like to. - This is, this error typically indicates a problem
[32:13] related to blockchain data synchronization or integrity when using dashes while libraries can occur
[32:18] for several reasons. Network configuration, wallet configuration,
[32:23] node connectivity, dependencies. Yeah, most of this stuff we've already tried.
[32:28] - Yeah, what I want to, what I want to. - Here is not necessarily debugging it,
[32:33] but just making sure that we've met the prerequisites for. - Yeah, yeah, all it is is the node version
[32:45] and the dependency version. Those are the only requirements included in the docs.
[32:49] - And then you just copied and pasted. You just copied and pasted the code.
[32:52] - Yes, absolutely, yeah, exactly. - Expand the line 17, the client options.
[32:58] - Yeah, that's where the mnemonic is. - Okay, so we got a test net network.
[33:05] We got a wallet that has valid mnemonic. And then, is this skip synchronization before height?
[33:15] Was that part of the tutorial, the docs? - Yes, so that's in the docs.
[33:20] Yeah, the one we were given in the Discord was slightly different.
[33:24] Do you want me to try that one as well? - How was it different?
[33:29] - It was a different number. - Oh, this is different, yeah.
[33:33] - Same API, but different number. - Yeah, it was 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0
[33:38] instead of 8, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0. - Okay.
[33:42] - Let's see what happens. Hopefully, it'll do basically the same thing.
[33:46] - That warning, by the way, that you see there, that's been there for a long time.
[33:58] - Yeah, that one shows up for the commands that even work. - This looks like it was a success.
[34:05] - Hey, look at that. So, that's what needs to be updated in the docs then.
[34:11] - Well, with that, and I wanna know what, why, what difference is that making?
[34:17] 'Cause it's, obviously, it's just changing what block it starts synchronizing at.
[34:25] And my guess is that it needs to be after the latest version was deployed
[34:32] or something like that. Let's see, only sync from mid-2023.
[34:37] That's what the 900-- No, that's where we got two things going on here.
[34:44] That's from this. When he gave me that, he just had a number saying this.
[34:49] - And my guess is this has to be a reference to the core blockchain height,
[34:55] not the platform blockchain height because platform gets restarted all the time on testnet.
[35:02] When the DCG devs make a new release, sometimes that requires them to, basically,
[35:11] start the platform blockchain over again from zero. So, there's no way that it's getting
[35:19] up to that height that fast. So, I'm guessing that that's referring
[35:23] to a block, a core height. But I'm just gonna open Insight
[35:28] and see if that's in the realm of Insight. - Okay, while you're doing that,
[35:33] I'm going to, basically, go back to my original code and then do that with the correct config
[35:38] and make sure that that still works. - Yeah.
[35:41] Oh, and I need to look at this on the testnet. Testnet core explorer, there we go.
[35:58] (keyboard clicking) And here's our familiar SPV client error
[36:15] that we saw before. - Sorry, what does that mean?
[36:22] - Well, it's not, I'm just saying, this is an error that we've seen before,
[36:26] this empty SPV chain. Have we not seen this?
[36:30] - I haven't seen this yet. - Was this not the error that you ran into earlier?
[36:34] I noted that it was something related to SPV. - Interesting.
[36:40] Let me see. - Yeah.
[36:44] You said-- - Right, yeah, it's a different error, though.
[36:51] This was chain contains orphan chunks. That was the previous SPV error,
[36:56] whereas now it says empty SPV chain, so it's not quite the same error.
[37:00] - Okay. - So I'm not sure what is up with that.
[37:05] - @-evo/-spv, spvchain.js.
[37:15] Yeah, and once again, I don't want this to be a big debugging session necessarily,
[37:26] but-- - Sure, yeah, I just wanted to know these things,
[37:29] 'cause I might need to go back and basically retrofit my tutorial
[37:34] to make sure that it works, and I wanna see where it works and where it doesn't
[37:38] with what the code I've currently got, you know? - Yeah.
[37:43] - It wouldn't be a huge lift, I don't think. - Bro, and we are, are we back to,
[37:50] looks like we're back to import statements, if I'm not mistaken.
[37:54] - It seems like it, yeah. - Like you changed it, did you change it back?
[37:59] - Yes, yeah, yeah. So yes, so the code I've got in my example is using ESM,
[38:03] yeah, so basically, and I've got it separated with a client and one file that needs to be imported,
[38:08] and then that itself is using ESM to import the dash library and the .env,
[38:14] so there's kind of, so if I wanted to walk this back, I would take out the .env,
[38:19] and then I would take out the require, the import statements for require to try and narrow it down.
[38:24] - Yeah, so what we found out then-- - That's what I do offline.
[38:28] - What we found out then was that it wasn't the, it wasn't changing it to require that fix things,
[38:35] it was changing-- - Correct. - Sync blocks.
[38:37] - This is all we had to change, this single variable was what was breaking it, yes.
[38:42] So for the actual docs where they need to be fixed, this number needs to be updated,
[38:46] and then this example works as written. - Okay, now let's, I'm gonna put you
[38:52] in the developer's seat where, 'cause partly because I don't know the answer
[38:58] to this question, this isn't just a trial and error thing, but let's say that you want to help out
[39:03] and create that issue, do you know where to do that? Are the docs-- - Right here.
[39:10] So I clicked GitHub here, and then there's docs.platform, which is this,
[39:15] so this is what I would assume is where we would want to open the issue.
[39:20] - Yeah, and I would probably say maybe even move straight to a PR instead of an issue.
[39:26] - Yeah, exactly, 'cause I already know what needs to be fixed so I would fork it, push the change,
[39:32] and then, do you want me to go through that process right now, or do you want to call it here
[39:35] and maybe do that offline? 'Cause literally just be, just normal fork, open PR,
[39:43] someone's gonna have to review it. - I think we should do it, I think we should do it
[39:45] right now. - Okay, great. - It's not a big, that's like,
[39:48] that's the least, you know, that's a very simple change. - Yeah, no, let's do it.
[39:53] I can even do this, I can do this straight through the GitHub UI.
[39:57] - Yeah. So just in case other developers are watching this
[40:03] and want to go through this same process, then they'll at least be able to see this,
[40:09] you know, how to do it. - I guess here's the question, though.
[40:13] If I'm updating it in this one place, this is a single, I think this is gonna be in all of them.
[40:19] - Yeah, and honestly-- - Yeah, so like, so for this, this is also why I think
[40:26] having your client ops in its own file that is separate from every single example
[40:31] is useful for, this is an exact example of why I keep mine separate in its own file.
[40:36] - Yeah, exactly. So that would be a bigger PR
[40:40] that we probably wouldn't want to do on stream, but that might be a worthy PR
[40:44] because of that exact thing. I'm also-- - I guess here's my question.
[40:48] So there's two things I could do here. I could basically do a control find
[40:52] for every example of this and replace them all and do a PR for that, or I can propose the larger change
[40:57] of extracting out the client into its own section. - Yeah, I think that it would probably make,
[41:08] how many times does this occur? Let's-- - Every single one
[41:12] of these examples has the client in it. - Let's propose the change that separates it out
[41:17] like your tutorial because I think that is the better way to go.
[41:21] - Okay, for that, I'm gonna have to kind of like actually write that out in human language
[41:26] so I don't think that's the best use of our time to do that. - Probably not a best, probably not a good stream thing.
[41:30] You're right. - Yeah, but I'm happy, I'm happy to do that right when we get offline.
[41:35] - I don't know, to me, that client option should not break anything.
[41:41] Like just, I'm not-- - That's the control, that's where, no, no, no, 'cause that's where
[41:47] it actually connects to the chain. That's the most important part.
[41:51] - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm actually walking that back now 'cause that is where the new--
[41:57] - Like that's where I'm doing most of my debugging when stuff is broken, even thinking back to last year
[42:02] when stuff would be broken, the first thing I do is go to the client, make sure I got my right mnemonic,
[42:06] make sure I'm synchronized with the right part of the chain. So really, having to sync the certain part of the chain
[42:12] to get it to work or not, that's the fundamental problem that needs to kind of be worked out here.
[42:17] - That's kind of what I'm saying is, to me, it doesn't seem like the developer
[42:23] should have to worry about that. - Yeah, it's a very high-level thing that has to do
[42:28] with the idiosyncrasies of the chain itself and why would you need to sync to this part of the block
[42:36] and not another? This is something you usually don't have to think about
[42:38] with other chains, you know? - Exactly, yeah, and--
[42:42] - I guess, let me correct that. This is something that I do know has to be thought about
[42:46] but is usually thought about at the level of the infra, not the developer, 'cause I remember when I worked
[42:51] at Quicknode, there were specific chains that would give you the full history
[42:55] and then cheaper chains that gave you part of the history. - Yeah, the archive nodes versus the full nodes.
[43:00] - Exactly. - Yeah. - And this is only a testnet issue.
[43:06] This probably wouldn't happen on a mainnet but it is still a little bit annoying.
[43:11] 'Cause when I looked at that option, the first thing I thought was,
[43:15] this just helps speed up synchronization. - And that's what I thought too.
[43:20] Yeah, it should just make your commands run faster but as we're seeing here,
[43:24] it actually is a functionality issue. - Yeah, okay.
[43:28] - Okay, well, we learned something. I think we made progress here.
[43:32] - Progress, and I think we ran into errors again. We could go back and we could try to debug that next error
[43:41] with the SPV if we really wanted to because according to Dash Money on the Discord,
[43:50] he's not running into errors that we're running into and I don't know why.
[43:56] - And is he using the SDK? - Yeah, so one thing that we could actually move on to,
[44:02] depending on how much time you have and how much time we want to spend on this.
[44:06] - Yeah, infinite time. I'm unemployed, remember?
[44:08] - Okay, no, you're employed. You're employed with Dash right now.
[44:13] - Okay. - As loose as that term is.
[44:16] But I think it would probably be a useful exercise to try to get Dash Money's site up and deployed or--
[44:26] - You talking about the V repo he dropped? - Yeah, 'cause I don't think
[44:32] that's ever been shown on a stream. - Yeah, I know.
[44:35] - Well, here's the problem though. I looked at that and we need a working identity ID
[44:40] to get that working first. Which actually, I guess we got.
[44:44] - No, his code should do that for you. - Okay, well then let's--
[44:49] - Whatever difference is in his code. - I'm remembering we did fix the issue eventually
[44:52] so we did actually end up with an identity ID so we should be good.
[44:55] - The first thing that we should do is let's go ahead and pull up a web browser
[44:59] and then go to his site. I want to highlight this
[45:02] 'cause it's one of the only-- - I didn't notice.
[45:05] So this is very, it looks like this is only about three months old anyway.
[45:08] So this is something that was built that was very similar in terms of adding a React front end
[45:14] is kind of what I'm assuming. - Yeah, well he--
[45:17] - And he even has it. - He's got like little applications on here.
[45:20] - And this is great, this is super cool. - That link that you just clicked though,
[45:24] go back there 'cause I want to make sure, I want to look at that URL.
[45:27] Dash Money I oversell app. That is not the app that I know of
[45:32] and I don't know which one's more up to date. So he might have to update his metadata on this--
[45:38] - Do you have a link for the one you know of? - Yes, I think it's dash money.io.
[45:44] - Dash dot or-- - Just dash money.io.
[45:51] - Okay. Oh, it looks like this,
[45:55] oh, okay, so this is just the oversell link that goes to dash money.io.
[46:00] It's the same thing, it's what's happening here is the GitHub has a link
[46:04] to the Vercel deployment and then on your Vercel account, someone has mapped this domain to the correct one.
[46:11] - That could be it, but that's most likely what it is, but--
[46:16] - In theory, that's what's happening. - Okay, we could maybe check his GitHub actions
[46:23] or something to see if there's any-- - We would check his deployments right here.
[46:27] - Yeah, that's what I meant. - That's going to here.
[46:31] So this is also the longer URL. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what's happening, cool.
[46:38] So do you want me to put my account log in here? - Well, no, I don't wanna use the app necessarily.
[46:44] Well, I guess we could just to demo to people what we're dealing with, what we're working with
[46:49] and what we're gonna spin up. But eventually, I wanna have you clone it down
[46:53] and then launch it as your own. - Let's do it.
[46:57] Let's make sure we're going through the readme. So it says first copy the repository.
[47:08] Connect to copy to, yeah, so he's saying here he uses Vercel at environment variables
[47:16] and domain into hosting service. Yeah, this is giving you like the full instructions
[47:21] in terms of if you actually want to deploy this thing as well.
[47:25] And then these are the four. - That's exactly what we're trying to do.
[47:28] So he's got good documentation, that's good. - Okay, so we need to, yeah, so one thing I would recommend
[47:38] is having it a .env.example file that you could basically copy this from.
[47:43] - Yeah, and in our deployment, I don't know if you have a Vercel account
[47:53] or if you wanna use that. - I do. - But I actually would almost prefer
[47:57] to try to get it working without a Vercel account 'cause in theory, you change these environment variables.
[48:07] Like I know this is, deployment is a tricky topic, so. - Yeah, deployment, if you wanted to actually,
[48:13] I could get you a decentralized front end. If you really want one, I could do that.
[48:18] It would be a lot more work than getting it on Vercel, but I know how to do that.
[48:23] - No, I'm not necessarily talking about decentralized front end like IPFS versus Vercel.
[48:29] I'm just talking about, this is a simple, this is a single page application using React.
[48:38] - Yeah. - And we should be able to just deploy it through GitHub Pages, for example.
[48:44] - I guess, but then you need a GitHub account. - Yeah, I mean, we could do it in different ways.
[48:51] So if you have a Vercel account and you wanna do that, then let's do that.
[48:55] - Yeah, I guess. - I just don't like, I don't like applications
[49:00] that depend on a platform. - You're depending on GitHub though, so is that just,
[49:06] you already have to depend on GitHub, so I guess it still removes the thing you have to depend on.
[49:10] - I don't know, I just gave GitHub as an example. - But what would be, so then I'm asking you then,
[49:14] what would you-- - You could spin up your own DPS, for example.
[49:17] - Your own, what's a DPS? - VPS, Virtual Private Server.
[49:22] - Yeah, but that's not simple, though. - I know.
[49:26] - And then you're doing that. Most people who would do that, they would use Amazon.
[49:31] So then they're creating an Amazon account. It's like you're literally talking about
[49:34] racking your own server. Like, I guess you could technically do that,
[49:39] but who realistically is gonna do that? - Yeah, it doesn't matter really to me.
[49:45] I just, I wanted to discuss it a little bit because it is one of those things where,
[49:52] like we were talking about this a few days ago in the Dash Discord, because somebody had,
[49:59] one time was his name, he had an idea for an application of building like a poker app that was decentralized and--
[50:09] - Yeah, we talked about this last time, yeah. - Yeah, and it is a rabbit hole
[50:15] that we probably don't wanna go down. Let's do one thing at a time.
[50:18] - Yeah, I mean, yeah, deployment, it's its own subject in general, and like, I think this is interesting,
[50:25] and like I've worked at deployment companies, so like this is something that I feel like
[50:28] I have a pretty good handle on. So that's why my brain first goes to IPFS,
[50:32] 'cause that's like, you're not creating an account. Like that is something where it is basically
[50:38] you could just spin up a CLI and hit it and like get a URL with a deploy thing.
[50:43] So I think for what you want, that makes the most sense from my brain.
[50:47] - It's not what I want. It's what I think, it's what some people think
[50:51] is necessary to have-- - Yes, yeah, yeah, and I think that's great.
[50:56] And there's a reason why I went through the process of learning how to do that a while ago,
[50:59] 'cause I do think it actually makes a lot of sense to not have to depend on a Vercel.
[51:04] I just think using a GitHub Pages, to me that's in the same ballpark as using a Vercel.
[51:09] - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay, so one thing at a time.
[51:11] Let us do it using Vercel, since that's already documented. And then after our discussion on Monday--
[51:21] - Let me go back then. I'm gonna fork this first then,
[51:23] since we're actually gonna deploy this. Yeah.
[51:26] - Monday, we're gonna be talking on Incubator Weekly. We're gonna be talking about IPFS, among other things.
[51:32] So maybe after that, we can then do this process again and host it on IPFS and then compare and contrast
[51:42] and discuss, but for now-- - Yeah. - We'll just--
[51:45] - Yeah, it would be an interesting exercise. And really it's the type of thing where your readme
[51:49] could just give a couple options. Be like, if you wanna do this, do this,
[51:51] if you wanna do this, do this, and then you can kind of leave it up to the user.
[51:55] - Yep. And then-- - I think that's
[51:57] always where to go. - While you're doing this,
[52:00] I have a few other things to say, just for context. So what we're doing now is we are,
[52:06] we're cloning down and we're going to deploy the Dash Money application to our own URL
[52:15] that we would then, we would control this application. And the reason that we're doing this right now
[52:22] is I want to get his code up and running to show us that he's actually getting,
[52:31] his code is working, or maybe it's not. But his code is theoretically working
[52:38] to get identities and making contracts and all this stuff that was in our tutorial,
[52:44] it is actually working for him. So let's look at what different options he has,
[52:49] or maybe we find out that this doesn't work for us either, and that there's something else that's preventing us
[52:56] from getting it to work. But yeah, if we can get his up,
[53:02] then in theory we should be able to get our tutorials working as well.
[53:06] (mouse clicking) - Okay.
[53:11] - Okay, so we're already on local host. This is great.
[53:14] - Okay, so should I try and log in? - Yeah, let's open the developer console
[53:22] and see what's happening. Let's see how many logs he's got going on.
[53:32] - Yeah. - 100, V100, and then there's just this empty array.
[53:36] Not sure what that's doing. - Okay.
[53:39] I don't know, we could check, because does it have source maps?
[53:46] Let's see. - It's an app.jsx, so it's gonna be right here.
[53:50] We're console logging. Oh, shit load of things.
[53:56] (laughing) 525 console logs, so I'm not sure exactly what,
[54:02] this is a very, very large app.js. I'm not sure I would even know
[54:05] what the hell to do with this, honestly. - Okay, wait, let's, how many lines is this?
[54:10] - 15,000. - Is this just one big file,
[54:16] and that's where all the application code is? - Oh, I mean, there's all these components as well.
[54:22] - Okay, so lots of components. This is a big app.
[54:26] - Yes. - App.js is 15,000 lines, wow.
[54:31] (laughing) - It's also a class component.
[54:35] Good for you, whoever built this. - Good for, I don't know, I'm not a class component myself.
[54:41] Okay, so let's go back to the logs and see what that was logging out.
[54:51] So that was-- - Well, let's say, I'm not really sure,
[54:54] because when I controlled F console, it has 525 things. - And it doesn't show you the line that,
[55:01] is it showing you the line of the compiler? - Let's see, oh yeah, sorry, 1,011.
[55:07] - Yeah. - Great, so that's our keys.
[55:16] - Okay, that's what I thought it would, that's what I thought it would be,
[55:19] because something like that, because we haven't actually got our mnemonic yet.
[55:26] Let's have it create one for us. (mouse clicking)
[55:30] Cool. There we go.
[55:35] So then we're gonna copy this, and let me copy, let me save both of these.
[55:41] So then, what do I do with, so I guess I'm gonna log in then.
[55:55] So. This is cool, this is a lot of what I probably
[56:02] was going to have end up building, so I'm glad I know this exists.
[56:06] - Yep. - So now send funds.
[56:08] - Yeah, this is a good reference application. - No, this is super solid.
[56:16] - I do wanna get it, I do wanna get to a point where we have a good tutorial,
[56:22] like a good single-page tutorial that's basically very similar to the dash.org docs,
[56:28] but, well, ultimately, maybe we could make the dash.org docs closer to your tutorial,
[56:35] like we were saying earlier, where it's split between files and whatnot
[56:40] a little bit better. - This is how I've tried to use the faucet,
[56:46] is I put my address in to get coins, and then it just kind of hangs.
[56:50] - Yeah, that's a problem with the faucet website. You got the coins, I'm pretty sure.
[56:54] - Okay. - You can check the explorer.
[56:58] The testnet explorer. - So, yeah, this--
[57:09] - You're not gonna find it there yet. - So, yeah, so how do I--
[57:12] - Go to inside testnet. - I know how to find it, 'cause I have it written
[57:18] in my own tutorial, but I can never find it by Googling it, for some reason.
[57:24] - Yeah, well, Google's not gonna pick up testnets, for Dash, especially.
[57:29] - That makes sense, so it's currently confirming the transaction.
[57:32] - Yeah, okay, so you got the coins. - Yes, I did.
[57:44] And then, once, let me close out, 'cause if I got too many tabs open,
[57:49] let me close these out. I'm still confirming.
[58:09] - Oh, it doesn't need to confirm to move on. Let's move on with the application.
[58:14] So, then, what's the next thing we do, then? - So, yeah, and this stream isn't meant
[58:21] to be like a full exploration of-- - Oh, here we go, all right, register identity.
[58:27] - Interesting-- - That's interesting. - Lots of errors happening in the console there.
[58:42] Wonder what that-- - But we did get it. - Yeah.
[58:45] - Okay, and now, we're gonna buy a name. - So, the identity, so, the takeaway with that last step
[58:51] was that the identity creation worked in his application. So, whatever his application is doing,
[58:57] we need to do that same thing. - Right, yeah.
[59:01] Yeah, so, I'm assuming, actually, well, let me just-- - So, like, we could look at his client options,
[59:11] for example, or-- - Let me just check this real quick.
[59:15] Okay, so, here's the create identity. Huh, okay, so, I'll just have to kind of break down
[59:24] this code and see what's, 'cause this is, you know, this has already involved some reactisms.
[59:29] It's like setting state and all that. - Well, yeah, we're not gonna actually break that down,
[59:33] because, like, we don't, I don't, I'm not particularly interested in exploring exactly
[59:41] how, like, what his application code is doing. I wanna know what his client options are, for example,
[59:48] that's getting his create identity to work over the network, but ours is not working.
[59:55] Like, all that set state stuff is just his business logic. - Yeah, okay, I see what you mean, yeah.
[60:02] So, we have to figure out where that is in this application. - Yep. - Okay.
[60:08] So, let's try this. (silence)
[60:12] Maybe you could do a find for client opts, or client options.
[60:27] - Yep. - There you go. - Well, it shows up a lot of times, though, so.
[60:31] Check platform only login, so, okay. (silence)
[60:39] I mean, it looks like it's just doing offline mode, and then setting the mnemonic.
[60:46] - Hmm. - But it also looks like there's 256 versions
[60:50] of this variable, so we need to figure out what the base one is.
[60:54] - Wow. That's interesting.
[60:58] Can you scroll through them? Yeah, just, like, cycle through them.
[61:01] - Yeah, it just shows up all over the place. So, it looks like he's creating a client object
[61:07] each time he's doing a function. And then, all of those are starting,
[61:13] are taking the doc array. - So, maybe--
[61:15] - I feel like, so, do you, could we get the person who built this on-screen?
[61:20] Like, that would actually help a lot. - That's the problem, that--
[61:24] - Do you know who built this? - I don't know him.
[61:26] He's an anon. He's an anonymous guy on the internet.
[61:31] - Okay, well, can I at least, like, is this the same person who was on the Dash Money account?
[61:36] - Yeah, yeah, he's available over text. - Okay, well, I know to have messaged him, at least.
[61:41] Okay, well, I'm gonna need to actually go through this code and try and make sense of it then
[61:46] before we start bugging him. But, is there anything else you wanna do, like, from here?
[61:50] 'Cause it sounds like we've got a working application and we hit the point that we were hitting an error,
[61:55] and so we're kind of, like, where we wanna be, it seems like.
[61:58] - Yeah, yeah. I wanted to see that, running locally,
[62:02] we could get his code to connect to the network and-- - Yeah, and I wouldn't worry about deploying this.
[62:08] I don't think that's really gonna change anything. - We don't need to deploy anything, necessarily.
[62:13] I just wanted to see that it was working, and it's too bad that he's got, how many,
[62:18] what was that, like, hundreds of client option instances? - Yeah, 256.
[62:25] - So, that's something that is not gonna, I mean, we could do,
[62:29] we could look at, like, click handlers on the actual application
[62:33] and see what lines of code he's calling on certain clicks, but it's--
[62:39] - Well, really, what needs to happen is this application needs to be broken down into hooks.
[62:43] Like, that's the problem, is that it's a giant-ass class component, and that's just kind of a problem
[62:48] with old-school React. - Yeah, and I don't,
[62:53] I'm not gonna say it's good or bad, but what I want for our tutorials
[62:58] is the absolutely slimmed-down version of Barebones Hello World that goes through each of them.
[63:06] So, it might be useful to try to dig into things, but it might be just as good
[63:12] to work from our tutorial forward and try to handle debug that way.
[63:20] We can take it from both angles and try to get it, but my point is not necessarily to,
[63:28] my point is to get Hello World applications first in Node, and then vanilla JavaScript,
[63:38] like we've done, and just basically get our tutorials working.
[63:41] And if the Dash Money app can help us do that, great, but it looks like it might even be harder
[63:47] to follow that line, that code, than to just debug from our code.
[63:54] So, I think that's probably, I mean, we've gone an hour or so.
[63:58] I think we learned some things, we showed some things, and we can probably continue off-stream to do,
[64:07] or you can just continue off-stream, and then we can stream again
[64:13] once we have done some off-stream debugging, if we get past some errors,
[64:19] and maybe somebody can help us out, like in-- - Yeah, I mean, currently where I'm at,
[64:25] I just need to refactor some of my tutorial to get it to work with the current state of the docs,
[64:31] with the right synchronization, and then we can move forward from there.
[64:34] So, I know exactly where we can go from here. - Yeah, cool.
[64:38] So, I think that's a good place to stop, then. Unless you have anything else to say, I guess we'll--
[64:43] - Yeah, no, I think that's good. This was super fun, I learned a bunch.
[64:47] - Cool, yeah, me too. I mean, that was good.
[64:50] So, are we, well, you wanna do the same time next Tuesday? - We don't have to wait 'til Tuesday.
[64:57] We don't have to even schedule these things. So, in terms of coding, you know, AJ--
[65:03] - Maybe we should aim for like, Friday, then. I think that would be good for me.
[65:08] - Yeah, whenever you have time, we'll just, you can hop on, we'll get you set up
[65:13] so that you can hop on whenever. - I can, I'm already set to stream here.
[65:16] - You're already set to just go live whenever. - Cool, so that's actually, yeah, that's a good idea.
[65:21] I think next time I go live, I don't need you here, 'cause I can start working through my tutorial
[65:26] and just kind of retrofit it with the stuff we know that works, and then we'll see how far I get.
[65:31] We'll go from there. I'll probably do that Thursday or Friday.
[65:34] - Yeah, and you can decide for yourself how much you wanna work offline versus on-screen.
[65:39] I kind of prefer more on-screen. - No, I agree, yeah.
[65:45] I absolutely agree. I was watching my old streams earlier
[65:49] to try and remind myself what was going on. I was like, man, I'm so glad I streamed this,
[65:54] because it was very, very useful to go back and watch. So, totally on board with that.
[65:57] - Yeah, and I think it helps other developers as well, 'cause what I don't like is I don't like
[66:01] all of the knowledge about, oh, this is the trick that you have to do for this setting.
[66:06] - Yeah, and you need to message just one person to figure it out.
[66:08] It is a bit of an issue, yeah. - I want it all open, open source, yeah, so.
[66:14] - Cool, awesome, man. Well, let's head off, and we'll catch you all next time.
