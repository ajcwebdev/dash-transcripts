Anthony demonstrates building Dash cryptocurrency applications with various frontend frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Lit, and Preact.

tl;dr:
In this solo coding livestream, web developer Anthony Campolo walks through the process of building applications that interact with the Dash cryptocurrency using a variety of popular frontend frameworks, including React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Lit, and Preact. He starts by setting up an Express server to handle API requests and generate a Dash wallet, then proceeds to integrate this backend with each frontend framework. Throughout the stream, Anthony discusses the unique challenges and considerations of working with blockchain technology, as well as the potential for cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications to revolutionize web development and create new funding models for open source projects.

[00:00] >> Hello, everyone. My name is Anthony Campolo.
[00:07] Welcome to episode three of building frameworks with Dash's stuff. I'm in a bit of a different setup because I've got relatives here, but it should be
[00:19] fine. We're going to be continuing on where we were before we had done React and Vue, and so we're
[00:27] going to do Svelte, Solid, Lit, and Preact. Then a vanilla JavaScript example, so that would give us like seven examples, which is
[00:36] probably more than enough. I decided to take Alpine out because there wasn't like a beat starter for that, so it
[00:43] kind of stuck out. And then I took out TypeScript, so because.
[00:50] Let me go ahead and ping Ryan in case he wants to come watch. We've got one person watching.
[01:01] All right. Hello, person out there in the world.
[01:07] I got the AJCwebdev Discord handle before anyone sniped it from me. Okay.
[01:16] Hey, Ben. What's up?
[01:18] And you're watching on Dash Incubator's YouTube? Oh, no.
[01:21] You're watching on mine. I'm streaming from four places.
[01:23] By the way, what's up, Ben? How are you doing?
[01:25] This is people from the Dash community. Probably don't know you, but this is accessibility expert and developer at Microsoft.
[01:27] What's the name of your team? Okay.
[01:29] Hey, Ben. What's up?
[01:31] And you're watching on Dash Incubator's YouTube? Oh, no.
[01:33] You're watching on mine. I'm streaming from four places.
[01:35] By the way, what's up, Ben? How are you doing?
[01:37] This is people from the Dash community. Probably don't know you, but this is accessibility expert and developer at Microsoft.
[01:44] What's the name of your team? Because I remember the name changed.
[01:47] So remind me of that. Something to do with education or learning.
[01:53] Pretty sure. Microsoft Learn.
[01:55] Yes. Got it.
[01:57] Oh, really? Interesting.
[01:59] Feel free to say more or not. Yeah.
[02:07] Yeah. We should figure out a way to make it worth your time, where you can give me some accessibility
[02:16] tips on -- I feel like my Astro website could probably -- I don't know if there's -- hope there's no blaring holes with it, but there's always stuff we can improve, you know?
[02:25] You're not really streaming anymore, though, so I can't just hop on a stream and make you fix stuff for me, so -- all right.
[02:33] Let me start sharing my code here. We can just jump right into it.
[02:45] Double check all my windows. Yes.
[02:48] See? There's a window.
[02:50] Okay. All right.
[02:52] We remove link underline, which makes them indicated by color alone. That's really funny.
[03:06] This is part of -- there's, like, weird CSS stuff that's been happening in mine because I had changed lots of, like, little things.
[03:14] This is one of the things that I, like, tweaked and changed in the styling a little bit, and so there's, like, some small changes I made but never documented, so now that I'm trying
[03:22] to get parity back with the original template, I'm, like, reversing all these small CSS decisions I made, which is good, because I had to, like, rethink whether it was actually the right
[03:30] thing or not, but getting the links to both change color and underline is the thing. I think it might be -- it's already underlined, and then when you hover, both the text and
[03:43] the underline turn into a color. I think that's what the ideal thing I wanted was.
[03:50] Anyway... Present.
[03:52] All right. Hurry here, folks.
[03:54] That's a fine approach. Yeah.
[03:56] That's not what I was doing right now, though, so I hate to go back to doing the thing I want it to do.
[04:14] Okay. So let's kind of review just the last couple projects so we can get some context for what's
[04:23] going on here. I've also got most of the structure of this kind of figured out.
[04:35] So I shouldn't make all of my links clickable divs is what you're saying. That would not be the thing to do.
[04:46] So one thing that might make this a little cleaner is if we created, then, one more subfolder that had each of these, but then you're having two nested subfolders to get to the front-end
[04:58] frameworks. So I'm just going to keep it like this, and there's the API, which right now has this
[05:09] expressive server. So the first thing you want to do is you want to get this one running, because this is what's
[05:15] going to serve up your dash data, and I also have reading instructions that should work with PNPM, NPM, or Yarn.
[05:30] I would recommend not using, actually, it's time, it's time, don't need to include instructions for Yarn.
[05:40] People should not use Yarn, but it's set pretty well for PNPM right now. So this will get, actually, so I'm going to create another new wallet for, if you're just
[05:59] getting started, I'm going to clone this down totally from scratch, let me just follow my own instructions.
[06:04] So first you clone it, and then install dependencies, and then this will copy over your environment variable examples to this, it already has your network set to testnet, because I think
[06:21] that's like the only net running right now, and you can put a, if you already have a wallet address, a mnemonic, you can go ahead and fill those in, but if you're starting from
[06:32] scratch, you can run the create wallet script, which is here. So this is using the client.
[06:49] I ended up splitting the client up into two things, mostly because I wanted to be able to import client just from here, without having to import it from the API, but I still want
[07:01] the single source of truth client in the actual API, so that's why I'm importing and exporting client just right here, but the client, some of the stuff I need to decide whether I want
[07:18] this to actually do this or not, but what would be nice is if it were to check whether you had a mnemonic or not, and then was able to decide whether to create a new wallet or
[07:29] not for you, because if you run the create wallet command, I think you can get it to, if you already have an account or a wallet in there, then it'll know what to do with
[07:38] that, but let's do this for now, but where we want to start is we want mnemonic to be null, so that's, I'll just pop it in here for now, and then take that.
[08:08] This should do what we want it to do, I think. That is the thing we wanted, and you can just copy and paste that, pop it in here, and at
[08:37] this point, we're all set up to run the server, and so the server, it'll pnpm serve it, and so I'm just going to step here, I believe, and tell us to go into the API folder.
[08:56] Actually, though, hold on, I've got this package.json, but not a package.json here, so I don't want to do that.
[09:30] Okay, so it's trying to find API server, but it's in Express, there we go. Now we can get this going again, so let's do a couple things here, cache up on 3x, yeah,
[10:10] so they're slow rolling the Discord usernames like Chantastic and Theo, they got theirs a couple weeks ago, it was as popular as Chantastic and Theo, by that logic, and more popular
[10:26] than you, but yeah, I mean, AJCwebdev, who else would want it at this point? So this, we're going to go, localhost 3001, name AJCwebdevtest, save the checks, I'm not
[10:54] sure if I fully get that, I mean, I know it's like a plan to save the trees, but what is the X?
[11:03] Like Star Trek? Save the T-Rexes, oh, I see, ambiguous, save the T-Rexes, that makes a lot more sense,
[11:13] I was imagining T-Rexes as a single word, all right, this is now pulling in our dash domain name, so let me put this here, nope, herb, I like this one, yep, okay, all right,
[11:50] so, and you can also set this, if you're so inclined, to here, and then I can bring in here, server URL, wait, this is in the front end, not the server, so I want this in React
[12:35] over here, yep, I think React 18 doesn't make you do all the weird environment variable stuff you used to have to do, let's see, actually, I haven't even verified this works yet, so
[12:57] let's hold off on that, so, now, since we're going to be using the React example, so we're done with this stuff, there's nothing, that's all the steps, so the steps were clone it,
[13:25] all dependencies, set up your .env file, create your wallet, serve your express server, and then curl it, so at that point, any of the front ends are going to hit something like
[13:41] this, this, I definitely want to change, so this should be mnemonic here, let me try leaving off the command for syncing and just see if it actually makes a difference or not, okay,
[14:09] so now what we want to do is we're going to want to go into the read me of our React, so we can go there from here, so if we look at this, you can kind of click into any of
[14:24] these projects from here, that takes you straight to the read me, and let's see if those steps still work, so now we're back here, keep this running, back to batch examples, and whether
[14:47] you want this step to also be there, I'm probably going to leave them in there, because then someone who jumps straight to a front end example, they could just do this and that,
[14:55] I should probably warn them, though, they need to set up their server first, though, for now, though, let's do this, it would have been like that, and then I also included the
[15:21] component in the read me of each, because each of them, this logic is all boiled down to just a single component, and it's kind of cool seeing them all in comparison, because
[15:32] they're all written by chat GPT, except the React one, it's so consistent in terms of how it names each variable, and how it translates, where the state is, where the trigger fetch
[15:43] is, and it's pretty awesome, it would have taken me a while, or I would have just done half-assed versions for half the frameworks, you know, so chat GPT, oh, yeah, and on Monday,
[15:59] I'm going to be with the dash weekly show again, to kind of talk about using chat GPT to build a lot of these out, it was really easy, like, I, the view one worked out of
[16:16] the box, the spelt one worked out of the box, I think all of them worked out of the box, except Angular, and that's because I was using analog, which is a new framework, if a framework
[16:28] did not exist prior to September 2021, then you're going to have significantly worse chances of getting chat GPT to understand what you're doing, unless you want to feed it a bunch
[16:36] of context code, so if I kind of fed it a bunch of individual files of an analog project, it would be able to figure out kind of what's going on, but there was something in the router,
[16:49] and luckily, I'm good friends with the creator of that framework, so I'll just ask him, hey, what's going on, but aside from that, the lit example, I think, even worked, so let's
[17:04] look at this one right now, so PMPM dev, but I need to fix the packets on JSON in this one, this was kind of a holdover from when this was all in the one packet of JSON, and
[17:19] I had NPM run all command, so you could run both your server and your front end at the same time, that's still pretty nice to do, and I might go back and include those steps
[17:33] and just throw the read me if someone wants to run a single command to get everything set up all at once, or even be cool, I would run the server and then every single front
[17:43] end framework on a different port, just because chaos is fun, okay, looks good so far, will it fetch the data, fetch the data, all right, so now let's go back and see if we can do
[18:03] this like that, yeah, no, because you need to do, there's a thing, there's a thing, actually no, it's because it's VEET, VEET is the one who has the thing, VEET environment variables,
[18:28] framework.meta.emv, I always forget, oh, got part of it there, I probably freaked out because it didn't turn to a string correctly or something, or maybe, okay, not worth it to figure out
[19:09] right now, because you can just kind of, for now, just hard code localhost in there, and then I still haven't deployed this anywhere yet, let me just try this on Railway, but
[19:28] that's another thing for another time, okay, so we got the React one, and then let's just double check the Vue one, that should be all good, so I'm going to kick out of here, go
[19:44] back to Vue. I'll fix these, also. Okay, cool. Okay, so you do notice there's a slight thing that's different now, it's showing null here, whereas React, I think it was just blank,
[20:21] so that's something to fix right now that I want to just get all the examples working, so let's make a note of that. Readjusting screen. Real estate is valuable. Okay. Okay.
[20:50] That's right, we need this, these separate. That's what I want. Okay. Great. So Vue works. Have we changed anything yet? Of course we have. That's good. That's good. That's terrible.
[21:24] Save this, though. Boom, boom. And save this, also. Okay. Great. Okay. Okay. So, let's see. Great. Actually, I do want this here, yeah.
[22:18] Okay. And just to make sure, I'll link back up to here. Okay. That's all a bit housekeeping. Let's commit this.
[23:05] Okay. Great. Great. Okay. So, now let's do Svelte. Oh, this, I don't know if either of you or anyone else watching watches Dax, the one
[23:52] of the people behind SST. He did a between two ferns parody with Fred Schott a while ago and he just put out one yesterday with Rich Harris and the creator of Svelte. It's
[24:09] really funny. So, we're back on Lex Friedman. Yeah, this is the stuff. It's so funny. Okay, let's get back to this. Get this Svelte one going. Great, great. Okay. Great, great. There's
[24:52] also -- oh, I was going to make a note. View. Okay. Great. And then, also, you'll notice that should be here. I had it correct with a little bit of CSS and I got lost in the
[25:28] process at some point. Fix. And then, okay. So, now it's undefined. The last time I built it, it was undefined because JavaScript. That's really funny. Great, great. Let's do solid
[26:09] now. This one, unlike all the others, went to 3,000. Solid. Have fun with us. Okay. Previously, it has been one that's hard to remember. Hey, what's up, Fuzzy? How you doing? Have you
[26:57] started your new job yet? That's super exciting. Congratulations. Good to see you, too. Your new gig is at the Linux foundation, right? Like a thing that's under or a part of. I
[27:19] know that's many interlocking chambers of things. So, I have no idea what their structure is, but I'm pretty sure that's where you ended up. Something in that area. Great. You'll
[27:40] notice this looks like just create React app. I mean, I can't believe it because you're a Fuzzy Bear, obviously. Who wouldn't want to hire a Fuzzy Bear? I'll hire a Fuzzy Bear
[27:55] in a second. Okay. So, this one needs a lot of work on the styling. This one starts with hey, look at that. No null or undefined. And I bet going from JSX to JSX probably made
[28:21] that smoother. That's what one of my now bosses said. Which thing specifically? Oh, this is where I had did this actually work? I think it did. Great. So, no. Oh, I know why. I just
[28:59] set it as a string here. Of course, that works. That's right. So, what was your connection to that? Did you know someone there already who was working or did you reach out or did
[29:18] they reach out to you? Be curious. They're like, hey, we want some of that Scottish energy. We don't have enough Scottish people, obviously. So, what is Dash? So, I don't remember where
[29:39] you fell on the whole cryptocurrency thing, but Dash is a cryptocurrency. I think you're someone to express in solid. Yeah. So, there's you almost can't tell at all this is a crypto
[29:50] project, can you? So, it's a that's a very fuzzy story. Yeah, I bet I can imagine you would have dabbled in this at some point, but Dash is aimed at trying to make it trying
[30:08] to make a cryptocurrency, which is the Dash cryptocurrency, actually usable as a currency you can spend to buy things because more fuzzier than Astro story there. Well, actually, so
[30:23] I got a funny crypto Astro story. You go to this Ben Holmes and me have built out a project using this is on taking after to the moon with quick node. So, we connect a Astro to
[30:48] just a Ethereum smart contract. So, this thing, every web three stack has a front end framework and Astro is like a perfect one to use. That's why I always say web three is jam-stacked
[30:59] by default. They all have decoupled, you know, client as fetching from a backend. It just doesn't fetch markdown or JSON or from a database. It's just does it on the blockchain just any
[31:12] other end point. So, I'm doing this and yeah, so Dash is paying me in Dash to build these examples and to stream it and they have a Dow that is apparently functional and they
[31:27] have a certain percentage of mining fees set aside to pay for a core team to build features and maintain. And this is, so I've been, I've been saying this for years. I recognized back
[31:39] in 2018, I made this pitch many times in 2022 that web three and Dow's if they're set up correctly have a solution, a sustainable solution to funding open source. Like we've always
[31:50] talked about like there's no solution to make sustainable open source. So, we have all these PCs feeding all this money and it's like, no, we actually have a perfectly viable solution.
[31:58] I now know it's a viable solution because the money is in my bank account, but yeah, it's a, it's pretty rare, I think, to for a project to get to this point, but this is
[32:12] why Dash is a very interesting project and it's been around for close to 10 years now. Okay. So, I missed this one. Comparing rich to the game. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. He's watching
[32:24] the video. So, Ryan, you should make more of a catch to fuzzy about why Dash is cool. I think I covered most of the things you usually cover. Here we go. The original Dow. That's
[32:35] great. I like that someone wrote this article already for me seven years ago. Is this really that old? Wow. Disclaimer, we take no responsibility for this article you're about to read. That's
[32:58] great. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, when did it come out? So, it started, yeah, post 2014. That's what I thought, because this also has governance stuff in it. So, it would have been around
[33:28] the same time. I mean, I'd be, I'd be curious to be like, what is, I would, when I'm recommending any of these things to people, I would want to know, like, first, have you ever even like
[33:42] purchased a cryptocurrency? Do you have, have you ever used a wallet? Do you want to figure out how to build apps with them? Do you want to learn how to interact with them? I mean,
[33:51] I know you're not trying to get into Web3 right now, but I know you're a naturally curious dude. So, I think that if you wanted to kind of check out what is an interesting cryptocurrency
[34:04] project right now, Dash is one that I'll point you to. Also, I don't know if you know AJ from Ocean Jabber. Yeah. So, let me, so let me show what I did in the beginning. So, ultimately,
[34:20] so there's this thing called the Dash. So, there's this Dash client. So, what the Dash client does is it's connecting us to the Dash blockchain network and it's feeding it your,
[34:38] so think of this like your credentials. It's like an API key. This is something you wouldn't want to leak. So, you wouldn't want to expose on the client. So, it has to be server side.
[34:46] It's very, very important. This never ever is client side. So, Express right now is managing that. What I eventually want to do is have them run as serverless functions. So, this
[35:01] allegedly should be what I would want to do where it's using a Vercel function and this is using a Netlify function. Both of these hit weird snags due to some dependencies in
[35:15] the Dash library because just with any of these platforms, it's guaranteed to break the first time. Then you test it and you figure out where it breaks and then you make a change
[35:27] and sometimes you have to ask the deployment company what the heck's going on because both of these things are AWS Lambda and that, but because Netlify built many conventions and
[35:37] Vercel built many conventions, you arrive at two slightly different implementations of the same thing, which is kind of frustrating. But the thing we're going to want more so
[35:50] is we're going to want these to run on Edge functions. So, that's even more complicated because then it can't use a node environment at all. So, I kind of punched on all that
[36:01] and I'm just using the Express server right now and the Express server is barely doing anything. So, all it's doing, all it's doing is, you know, initialize the app, set your
[36:14] course thingy and then I have a route for name and then it's going to take whatever name you gave it. So, that's why when we're curling it, we are doing the, let's see, let's
[36:40] see. This is my one. Is it still going on? I broke something somewhere along the way, but I guess you can see the same. Yeah, for sure. And that's, that's a whole, whole thing.
[37:09] So, but anyway, when you, so when you curl name forward slash, whatever. Oh, I don't want. Okay. So, so this is our endpoint. What it's doing is it's, this is, these functions
[37:24] are kind of the most important thing of what's happening here. So, it takes your identity name and then what it does is it sets that to name. So, it'll be ajcwebdevtest.dash.
[37:39] And then that is the name that resolves because this is like how Ethereum has ENS. They have the Ethereum name service to where you can have ajcwebdev.eth and then you can like send
[37:52] money to it or create websites based off of it. So, I loved crypto domains. It was one of my favorite things to work with when I was doing web three stuff because it is connected
[38:02] to the actual web because it's, you know, their domain names and it's DNS and all that kind of stuff. But it doesn't entirely work with DNS out of the box in normal browsers,
[38:14] which one sense is like, it's why those things need to change before that's actually going to work for normal people. But it's also kind of fun because then you realize there's ways
[38:24] to build things with and without DNS, which is a strange thing because if you're someone who went to a bootcamp and just learned the basics, all this stuff, you didn't even learn
[38:34] DNS. So, DNS is a thing that was just going on in the background. I don't do sales, I just don't. But Fuzzy, you can download Dash wallet and post an address.
[38:45] Send your bit to Flynn. Yeah, no, you should definitely take him up on that. This is how I would get people into this. I would tell them to download a MetaMask wallet and just
[38:54] give me their address. And then I would send them a loopy donut. You all know what the loopy donut is. Avatar now for like over a year. Cause they're like five or 10 bucks.
[39:05] They're super, super cheap. So I have like five on hand at any point in time and just get people. It's not the web. Well, it's not DNS, but there's the web that is also outside.
[39:21] Like it's email, the web. Maybe, maybe not. Or, you know, our mobile apps, the web. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know if all those work exactly the same way. IPFS is the really cool
[39:40] one though. Cause IPFS is not DNS, but it's very obviously the web. It's just a different way to access the web. So, yeah, I mean, even Tim Berners-Lee is all in on web three. He
[39:56] will never put it that way, but Tim Berners-Lee is building a rebranded web three project. So father of the internet says we can't be locked in silos like Facebook and Twitter
[40:15] and YouTube. This is the first thing is the first pitch I'll make every interview I ever gave about web three. Then you can add solid where you have user data where users get to
[40:26] share what the users want to share. So you give the power back to the users away from the platform. That was the second thing I would always say on every interview I gave
[40:36] about web three, but you won't see the term web three anywhere on here because no one wants to use that term because he didn't want the, he didn't want headlines to say Tim Berners-Lee
[40:46] builds cryptocurrency project and hangs out with Sam Bagman-Fried and Snorts Adderall. Like that's what people think now they think of web three. So he's like, no, I'm just going
[40:56] to build the thing that they're already building and call it something else and pretend like people won't notice. All right. Anyway, get my tabs back under control. He's all in with
[41:16] a portal project. What the portal project is. There's a lot of those. I just know portal like the video game. He calls it solid, which is also extremely confusing. It's like, bro,
[41:44] that name is taken. He's like cool tech though. Is this similar thing with blue sky? Blue sky is a web three kind of project like innately and makes the same, you know, pitch and has
[42:02] the same benefits, but it just doesn't use the term like it completely avoids it. And that worked out well for it. I think I don't care. We've already renamed it a bunch of
[42:13] times. It used to be Bitcoin or blockchain, not Bitcoin and web three, not blockchain. Now we're going to come up with another name. Yeah. So yeah, that's, that's interesting.
[42:33] I'll be curious to see what that looks like when you actually do this, Ryan, because I got a dot Ethel and set up pretty good. And then things happened, mistakes are made. And
[42:50] then I got some unstoppable domains that were pretty cool. And then I Cloudflare has the dot X, Y, Z domains, which is, I have a whole bunch of crypto domains, but I never obviously
[43:06] implemented any of them. It was registered. I didn't see. This one before. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Given the DNS compatible nature, they're technically domain names that register under
[43:41] something. Okay. So this is in conflict with this. Someone here is lying. Unless they're like it's compatible DNS. They're technically domain names. That doesn't mean you have a
[43:58] domain though. Because obviously, you know, if you go to AJC web dev test, nothing's going to happen, you know. Free browser can do that kind of stuff automatically. Okay. So it looks
[44:31] like this is the part I haven't gotten into yet. This stuff. Oh, this is the thing that this is just what's generated for you, I think. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I would say in general,
[45:00] you need more docs about DPNS because there's, it shows up throughout when you're actually creating the identity. And then you have this thing right here. It's not really enough context,
[45:11] I don't think. Especially if you're like, if you're saying this is DNS compatible and that it works with DNS, but like, that's it. Like that. Do I need a text record? Like,
[45:23] because when you do, this is so complicated. A lot of steps. So you're doing stuff like this. And then you have DNS coming into it. So you can add a text record. This would be
[45:59] one way to do it. And then I know IPFS, DNS link. And this is going to be I imagine what you guys are doing is going to be more in line with ENS and IPFS.
[46:15] IPFS is linking you to a whole file system. Whereas ENS, you're just linking to address on the blockchain at the end of the day. I never really fully understood though how then
[46:29] you would also be able to grab an IPFS hash and stick it in a text record and then it like just figures out that that's the magic that I wouldn't understand how to do.
[46:43] Okay. Not meant for today. Okay. Where was I? I think I was in solid. Great. We still got Preact. Context switching. Should work now. Boom. Boom. Preact. Yes. And this one,
[47:24] no, null or undefined. Cool. Get out of here. Why can't I close this? There we go. So let's see. So that makes sense. Lit. I hadn't. This was the last one I hadn't actually imported.
[48:03] This might be it. Okay. We're all going to get to find out together whether this works. Isn't that exciting? Yeah, this is the problem with lit being the only framework that ChachiBT
[48:31] has. I don't know how to use. Okay. I think I can figure this out. Start by doing this. That all goes above render. There's here. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and run this.
[49:27] Okay. Here's where there's something going on right here. I got a feeling. So let's stick with my element. And then we're going to have two render functions for a second. Okay. So,
[50:16] maybe it's locked. Okay. So, I'm going to do button. Don't need that. There we go. Okay. So, what do I need? Yes, my click is just throwing that function right in there. Still
[51:08] humming along. Good. Pretty close. Pretty close, I think. Okay. I don't need that. I'm going to need a constructor just because. This is why I don't know how class components
[51:45] work. Yeah, the problem is because I had to match the two components together in a way that I probably didn't know what I was doing. That's right. So, I can't do this. Okay.
[52:05] So, let's chat GPT it up at this point. This component is only displaying the H1 and not the S1 for fetching the dash. Maybe something super obvious, I'm sure. Probably don't need
[52:42] those. And this is a JS file. Okay. Let's see what happens. Okay. So, I'm going to run this. That's not good. Ooh, I think that's the issue. Nope. No one's talking at me. Fix
[53:37] my screen real estate a bit. Oh, was I running two servers at once? Oh, no, this is pre-active. Okay. Probably going to have to hop off fairly soon. Let's see if I can get this last one
[53:56] working. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Okay. So, let's see. Okay. So, let's see if I can get this working. Okay. Let me first before I go down too deep with this, I'm going to do a couple
[54:43] of sanity things. I'm just deleting all extra PM cam locks and node modules because I'm not sure if lit keeps up with all the hot new sometimes PM doesn't support PM PM which
[55:18] makes me very sad. But sometimes it's good to just check NPM. Okay. Great. This will take five hours to empty. Let's see. I probably got changes to commit. Yep. Notes. Notes.
[55:49] And then this travesty. Maybe I should just be doing that. Okay. So, start by installing and then run the server. And this will take a little bit longer because NPM is slow. Okay.
[56:24] So I'm going to commit all this but not that. Yep. Yep. Perfect. Okay. So, let's see. Okay. And then this will be NPM run serve. That's all good. Let's see what happens with this.
[57:15] There we go. Yeah, see, look at that. James Doe. What's up, James Doe? Yeah, so you notice how the fact this is a different error at all tells you that something funky going on
[57:36] between NPM and PMPM there. And this makes sense because we're talking about dependencies and monorepos and stuff always gets dicey. This might be. So, if JavaScript decorators
[57:55] aren't supported, what does that mean for lit? And chatGBT ran me out of data. I thought it was using the platform. Shouldn't it never break if it's using the platform? Oh, yeah.
[58:16] Okay. Here's my current component. I switched to NPM. This might be an issue as well. Let's see. Oh, that should be okay. It's telling me. And in this example, I want to make sure
[58:58] chatGBT knows what I'm asking it. So, I'm going to feed it probably more information than it necessarily needs, but it's good to give it more than too little to be able to
[59:10] be like, yeah, here's some things it could be. But if you just give it your actual all your stuff and junk, it'll be like, okay, I can see all your code. I know how to fix
[59:20] this because I'm a godlike robot. Okay. Here's my page.json. Here is my main.js file. Okay. Pretty good. I might not need this, actually. I'm going to go back to this. Let's delete
[60:16] the original thing. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's where you're wrong. So, we went through all of these examples, right? So, I had a
[61:03] preact example, a solid example, a salt example, and a view example. All of those were written by Chad and worked on the first try. So, it's only once we got to this one obscure older
[61:14] framework that was using all of this stuff. Yeah. All right. Later, man. Thanks for hanging out. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go
[62:11] back. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go to use a little bit cuz I already used it before. It was pretty much what I expected. Enhance would be a better one. Okay, I gotta hop off. This was super fun. I will be back sometime next week. Find out later. Thanks everyone for watching. Bye!
