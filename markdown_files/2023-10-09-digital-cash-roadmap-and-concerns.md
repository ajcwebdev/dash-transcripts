Dash's identity crisis stems from acting like digital gold while calling itself digital cash.

## Episode Summary

tl;dr: Dash inherited properties from Bitcoin that make it behave like digital gold, but it aims to be digital cash. This identity crisis can be resolved by offering traditional banking services on the Dash network, as credits issued by these services can eventually circulate as cash. A roadmap involving economists, developers, and marketers is proposed to achieve this.

## Chapters

00:00 - Introduction and Dash's Identity Crisis
The root of Dash's identity crisis lies in still acting like digital gold, despite calling itself digital cash, due to inheriting properties from Bitcoin.

03:05 - Cash as Credit and Historical Examples  
Amazon credits, M-PESA minutes, and even historical paper money have circulated as cash, showing that credits issued by institutions can eventually become cash.

07:04 - Dash as a Credit Institution
Dash should offer services of central banks, commercial banks, investment banks, and credit unions to establish its credits as cash. A roadmap involving economists, developers and marketers is proposed.

17:26 - Discussion on Austrian Economics and Money Creation
Rion clarifies he is not advocating abandoning Austrian economics for Keynesian economics. He argues money creation is a neutral tool that can be used for good or bad.

33:41 - Addressing Community Concerns 
AJ and Rion address various community concerns and comments regarding changing Dash's supply schedule and entrusting masternode owners with more resources.

50:10 - Mistakes of the Past and Need for Expertise
Rion reflects on past mistakes like allowing currency appreciation and not bringing in outside expertise. He emphasizes the need for economists and venture capitalists to help stabilize and build value in the Dash economy.

## Transcript

[00:00] [Music] How much money do you make?
[00:06] This question is considered impolite. Well, except for in Finland, where each year on November 1st,
[00:11] the regime publishes the salaries of each taxpayer. But for most of us, financial questions like this are considered private.
[00:17] But is it really private? It is private from a stranger, unless you tell them,
[00:21] but it's not private from those who maintain your bank account, and it's not private from the regulators, and from the enforcers.
[00:28] And further, that money you make, is it really yours? Well, if you're paid in cash, or in crypto to your self-custody wallet,
[00:34] or in precious metals, or some other physical asset, sure, it's pretty accurate to say that it's yours.
[00:39] But if you're like most, and your pay is deposited into your bank account, it's not as concrete.
[00:44] If your bank account is accessible, and if you're in the good graces of the regime, it can very much seem yours.
[00:49] But what if you want to withdraw all your money? That, surprisingly, isn't so straightforward,
[00:54] especially if others are trying to do the same thing at the same time. Or what if the political climate changes,
[00:59] and based on your stated views or buying habits, you're identified as troublesome?
[01:03] Then, accessing what you believe is "yours" can become impossible. Consider what happened in 2010,
[01:08] when the folks involved with Wikileaks shined the disinfecting light of transparency on the aggressive actions of U.S. military personnel.
[01:15] Rather than welcome this revelation, a politician, Joe Lieberman,
[01:18] demanded that companies stop doing business with Wikileaks. PayPal, through which Wikileaks said the vast majority of their donations were received,
[01:25] clicked their heels and fell in line. They froze and permanently suspended the Wikileaks account,
[01:30] preventing them from accessing their money. A more recent example happened in 2021,
[01:35] when the Canadian regime, upset at truckers for daring to question their policies, and at those sending donations to the truckers,
[01:41] suspended and froze the bank accounts of those involved. So again, if it's not in your possession, is it really "your" money?
[01:48] And let's not forget about Operation Chokepoint, a conservative effort by Obama's Department of Justice
[01:52] to lean on financial institutions that held accounts for industries they thought unfavorable, such as ammunition dealers.
[01:59] Or its more recent iteration, an effort by Biden's colleagues, aptly named Operation Chokepoint 2.0,
[02:04] to sever on-ramps between the legacy financial industry and the emerging cryptocurrency industry. If it's your money, shouldn't you be able to use it how you want?
[02:12] Want to go on a vacation? Well, if you cross the nation-state political boundary,
[02:16] almost all regimes mandate that you declare your assets at prescribed limits. You are told you must fill out paperwork.
[02:21] But if it's your money, why is it in anyone else's business? And what if you encounter fiscal mismanagement?
[02:26] Not your own fiscal mismanagement, but that of the regime. That's proven to be a time when what you think of as "your" money is shown to be otherwise.
[02:33] For example, recall the situation in Greece in the summer of 2015. What did regime actors do?
[02:38] They imposed a limit on withdrawals from ATMs. Even if a person had millions in the bank,
[02:42] they could only withdraw 60 euros a day. And these types of limits were imposed for three years.
[02:47] If a person is prevented from accessing their money, is it really theirs? What if widespread conflict is broken out,
[02:52] and you conclude that it's better to go than to stay? If you had a bank account, are you able to get out your cash?
[02:58] Probably not. And even if you are, just how easy is it to travel with?
[03:02] Might there be a better alternative? A more unstoppable money?
[03:05] A more uncensorable money? Since 2009, there has been.
[03:08] Cryptocurrency. And, as dramatized in the short video from the Bitcoin Cash Folks,
[03:13] by memorizing 12 words, you can vote with your feet to acquire more freedom while carrying your financial wealth through checkpoints
[03:19] and bypassing parasitic people. Did you make it, son?
[03:25] Yes, I'm here. They took everything from me.
[03:40] (sirens blaring) My money, my passport, my phone.
[03:50] (sirens blaring) Don't worry, it's going to be fine.
[03:57] Did you remember the 12 words? Yes, yes, I know the words.
[04:01] Opera, fabric, stereo, trash, gift, voice, country, engine, complex, new, fate, purpose.
[04:07] So what will you do? Will you continue to place trust in institutions
[04:11] that have demonstrated that they do not respect what is yours, that will click their heels when leaned on?
[04:16] Or will you utilize a medium of exchange that bypasses the old guard completely
[04:20] and take responsibility of your financial wealth? That's the solution offered by decentralized cryptocurrencies.
[04:26] Hello, everyone. Welcome to Incubator Weekly.
[04:37] How are you today, Rion? I'm doing really well.
[04:41] Thank you. We had a week off, so it was nice.
[04:47] My wife and I and the kids, we took a nice drive up through the Alpine Loop
[04:52] in the Wasatch Back, which is a beautiful place to see the wonderful leaves
[04:58] turning and scenery of Mount Tippanoagos in the background. So feeling good.
[05:04] Right on. Well, today, as you may have seen from the title,
[05:11] I'm going to present a concept that I submitted to Incubator that was accepted.
[05:17] And so without any further ado, let's jump right into... Oh, and sorry, after I present the concept,
[05:25] Rion and I will then be addressing, of course, any questions or concerns that you all submit
[05:31] via the live chat during this broadcast, but also I've scraped questions/concerns
[05:39] that were submitted over the weekend during the retreat presentations.
[05:44] And so we'll address those after this also. Before we get started real quick,
[05:49] I just wanted to say thank you for submitting this new concept to the Incubator.
[05:56] We did accept it, obviously. That's why we're kind of talking about it right now in the show.
[06:02] It's going to be -- we're going to be doing the tasks on the currently already accepted,
[06:09] more general, broad project called Economics R&D, Research and Development.
[06:17] And, yeah, I think that it's -- I think that we all just need to start talking about
[06:22] and thinking about this subject a lot more. And so this is kind of more or less the beginning
[06:29] of what I hope to be a lot of people thinking deeply about economics in Dash.
[06:36] And so thank you for -- you know, I didn't ask you to do this, obviously.
[06:39] This is just coming from you. And so I'm looking forward to seeing your presentation.
[06:42] I have no idea what you have in store here. -Right on. Well, hope not to disappoint.
[06:49] So let us begin at the beginning. Just about a month ago, maybe, I was --
[06:58] Okay, so I had bought -- After defythegrid.com started accepting Dash for goldbacks,
[07:04] I bought some from them. I don't know if I want to catch the light, right?
[07:10] So if you don't know what these are, these are -- This is gold that's been, like, embedded,
[07:18] somehow fused into a kind of polymer. And they call them goldbacks, and they've issued them
[07:23] for, I think, five or six states in the U.S. so far. Anyway, I think they're quite pretty.
[07:27] And so I wanted to learn more about the company issuing them. So I went to goldback.com, and I went to the team page
[07:37] and was surprised by what I saw at the top of the team page. So here you're seeing a picture of the founder and CEO,
[07:48] Jeremy Corden, and below his name and title is this quote, a quote I had not before seen,
[07:55] that reads, "Gold is money. Everything else is credit."
[08:01] And I thought to myself, "Well, first of all, that quote's unattributed."
[08:06] And so I was wondering, like, you know what? What cranky, old, crotchety gold bug said that?
[08:15] Who could have such a narrow definition of money? What a cranky crankster.
[08:21] So I went to look up the source of that quote and then was surprised even more by what I found,
[08:31] that it was attributed to none other than J.P. Morgan, one of the most renowned, successful, widely known
[08:41] bankers of all time. And so that kind of like, hmm, that was odd.
[08:48] But I put it aside. I put it aside.
[08:51] Fast forward to last weekend at the Dash retreat and Rion's presentations, both the presentation
[09:00] about Dash's current supply chosen number, chosen cap number, as well as the presentation about investments,
[09:13] the ones that-- well, yeah, just investments in general.
[09:18] They got me thinking again, particularly when I started reading all y'all's comments on those videos,
[09:24] because in the comments on those videos-- I haven't read them, so I think I saw one that was critical,
[09:31] but it'd be interesting. Well, I didn't hear it.
[09:35] Or any. Cash, money, currency, debt, they were throwing around--
[09:44] like, a lot of these terms were used. And I thought, maybe I can make more sense
[09:49] if I just look up the definitions of all these words, cash, currency, money, debt.
[09:54] And the more I looked into these words, the more I saw that there was just so much overlap
[10:01] between them that it was a little bit difficult to parse them out.
[10:04] And not only was there overlap between the definitions of these words, but in some cases,
[10:12] it seemed like, yeah, that applies to Dash. But then in others, it's like, no, that doesn't really
[10:16] apply to Dash. Long story short, this wasn't very helpful.
[10:21] I didn't feel that I had gotten very far ahead. And then I thought back to this quote, right?
[10:26] This thought back to this quote. And I thought, I have not yet looked up
[10:32] the definition of credit. I have not yet looked up the definition of the word credit.
[10:36] So I went to look up the definition of that word. And here we are.
[10:40] I would like to draw your attention to the second one, in particular.
[10:44] An entry recording a sum received, listed on the right-hand side or column of an account.
[10:54] And this, of course, brought to mind something that perhaps we will all have visual familiarity with.
[11:01] This is the Dash Insight Block Explorer. And I think as we can see here, this
[11:12] is precisely the definition of a credit. Let me go back and--
[11:17] an entry recording a sum received. So here we have that on the left and listed
[11:24] on the right-hand side of a column of an account. And there we have that on the right.
[11:31] And so this is-- our blockchain meets the definition of a credit system.
[11:40] And thus, it kind of became clear to me in a moment the root of our identity crisis.
[11:48] I don't know if any-- I mean, this was like one day on Discord about, I don't know,
[11:52] two months ago or something, three months ago or something. I said something like, blah, blah, blah,
[11:57] Dash has an identity crisis and has for a long time. Blah, blah, blah.
[12:01] But I wasn't able to give really any specifics about the root of the identity crisis, the nature of it,
[12:08] because I didn't know it. But I think that I do now.
[12:12] And that is that due to our inheritance, our literal inheritance from Bitcoin, we, for the most part,
[12:22] are still acting like we're a digital gold. Even though we call ourselves digital cash,
[12:28] we're still acting like digital gold. And that, I think, is the root of our problems.
[12:37] So let's talk more about this term "digital cash" and its relation to credits.
[12:46] I got thinking about that next. And the first thing that came to my mind
[12:51] was that I have seen Amazon credits used as cash. I remember hearing about, oh, call centers in India
[13:01] or Bangladesh or something have paid their employees in Amazon gift cards.
[13:08] And thus, are Amazon credits cash in those economies? But then I looked a little more into it.
[13:14] And it goes beyond that. There are large institutions in the United States
[13:20] that have paid their employees in Amazon gift cards. And thus, are those credits cash in those economies?
[13:29] Beyond that, we may remember hearing-- actually, heavily hearing years ago
[13:33] in the crypto space about M-PESA minutes, airtime, circulating as cash in various countries in Africa.
[13:44] That's a cellular company that provides the service, not only of routing cellular traffic,
[13:51] but they have a back-end plug-in to various banks on the continent.
[13:55] And so the minutes of M-PESA have circulated as cash. And then as one of the commenters--
[14:03] I think it was Diane Evans-- brought up in the comment section of one
[14:08] of the retreat videos, originally, what we call fiat today, paper money,
[14:18] those were credits back in the day. They were credits redeemable in metals held
[14:25] in the vaults of the banks, right? So even what we call money or cash today,
[14:32] those were credits back in the day. And so considering these examples and others,
[14:39] like, for example, the notion of the company store back during the Industrial Revolution,
[14:44] we see that credit systems can and do eventually morph-- the credits that they issue can and do become cash.
[14:55] And so given that we have a credit system at our disposal called the blockchain, what could we offer?
[15:07] What could people redeem their cash credits for that would cause it to one day be morphed into cash, right?
[15:14] Like, we don't have big warehouses to offer goods like Amazon.
[15:20] We don't have vaults to store gold, whatnot. Like, what is it that we have that people can redeem
[15:26] their cash credits for that is valuable enough that they could come to be circulated as cash?
[15:32] Well, a blockchain tracks credits. We can be a credit institution.
[15:39] Credit institution is kind of also another name for a bank, all kinds of banks.
[15:47] And that is what we should be offering, the services of central banks, commercial banks,
[15:58] investment banks, and credit unions. And so that includes--
[16:06] let me bring that up. This is a snapshot-- or I'm sorry,
[16:14] a screenshot of the concept that Rion was talking about that's in the incubator.
[16:19] So the services I'm referencing include investments, loans, currency exchange, insurance, notarization, credit scoring,
[16:29] market making, property titling, digital safe deposit boxes, brokerage services, et cetera.
[16:39] And I don't know about you, but once I made that list, read through that list, the next question that came to my mind
[16:48] was, why would anybody use our banking services when they have all those things already available to them
[16:57] via other systems? Far more established systems need not be mentioned.
[17:05] And I think that the answer to that question can be given by none better than Sam Westridge.
[17:13] So let's go ahead and listen to what Sam has to say. Like, that's just nature.
[17:26] Systems tend to evolve. If something is inefficient, something else that is efficient
[17:31] will come and take its place if it offers the same value. So right now--
[17:37] And let's just listen to that one more time. Like, that's just nature.
[17:45] Systems tend to evolve. If something is inefficient, something else that is efficient
[17:50] will come and take its place if it offers the same value. So the reason why people would use our banking
[17:59] services over the well-established banking services that are already available to them
[18:05] is because we are more efficient. So if we can offer the same value--
[18:09] and that's an if. That's what the roadmap is about.
[18:13] Then according to the laws of nature, as says Sam, our more efficient system will replace the older, less
[18:21] efficient system. So that brings us to my proposal of the creation of a roadmap,
[18:29] because these are obviously very big notions to be tackling. And there are four things that I think
[18:39] that the roadmap should have. OK, so the first is that it should be crafted.
[18:47] It should have the input by at least three different specialists.
[18:53] The first kind of person who should be contributing to this roadmap is
[18:58] who I would call an economist or even like a banker, like an actual banker.
[19:03] Because who better to tell us how these systems work than someone who has actually worked in these systems?
[19:11] So the first kind of person who needs to be part of this roadmap is an economist/banker.
[19:17] The second kind of person would be a blockchain developer who would take the goals, the research provided
[19:27] by the economists and bankers, and say how and whether and if such things can be implemented in our blockchain.
[19:35] And then, of course, to do the implementation. And then third type of person contributing to the roadmap
[19:44] would be marketers. And these are the people who would
[19:47] decide what things should be called, what our various services should be called,
[19:53] how we should talk about them, when we should talk about them, and to whom directly we should talk about them.
[20:00] And these three kinds of people, I guess I would call the research, development, and marketing
[20:08] stool, like three legs of a stool. And they should not ever operate independently of one another.
[20:16] We have seen in the past in Dash what happens when one or more of those research
[20:21] and/or development and/or marketing silos itself off from the other two.
[20:26] And it's not what we want. And so those three should always be
[20:31] within operation of each other and always be informing one another's activities.
[20:37] All right, the second stipulation for the roadmap is that it should be presented at--
[20:48] am I using the right terms, AJ? Agile and not waterfall, is that right, Rion?
[20:55] Yeah, the terms are a little bit-- like, yeah, I won't get into it.
[21:00] But go ahead and make your point. I think the terms don't matter as much as the concept.
[21:05] Yes. My point is that to the extent possible,
[21:10] we should be setting our goals along the roadmap as things that can be delivered as single products that don't all
[21:20] depend on each other and need to be delivered together all or nothing.
[21:25] Ideally, we will be able to release things one at a time, learn what there is to be learned from each release.
[21:32] Hopefully, we learned we made the right choice. But maybe we learned we made a mistake.
[21:36] And we can stop putting resources in the direction of that mistake and pivot.
[21:43] The third thing that the roadmap should have is that it should account for both our on-chain
[21:48] and off-chain options that are available to us right now. As a prime example, it should account for the fact
[21:56] that we have available to us the Dash Investment Foundation as an off-chain entity.
[22:04] And so recommendations for how we progress should account for what we have available to us off-chain.
[22:13] And if it can be moved on-chain, if any or all functions that we're doing off-chain can be moved on-chain,
[22:20] recommendations should be made for how to do that as well. And then finally, the development process
[22:27] and the roadmap itself should be done open source. So on GitHub, as I hate to say, but yes.
[22:37] And this is for multiple reasons. One, so that the community can see the state of the roadmap
[22:44] at all times so that they know what has or has not been accomplished.
[22:49] Two, so that we can more easily attract contributors from contributions from people we don't know.
[22:58] So that they can just log on and be like, la, la, la, here is a pull request.
[23:03] And we don't need to know them. We don't need to have had chats with them.
[23:06] They can just come make that suggestion. And number three, to attract attention.
[23:14] I would like for Dash's innovations to be talked about within the cryptosphere and beyond.
[23:23] Just like back in the day, when people were talking about, as we saw from Rion's presentation over the weekend,
[23:29] that Evan's launch thread of Dash had the most views of any non-Bitcoin coin ever.
[23:39] That is what I would hope to achieve by having this roadmap be developed on GitHub as well.
[23:45] So given these things, we can know that credit institutions, cash institutions,
[23:59] do not limit themselves in how many credits they issue. And I think maybe it's important to say
[24:07] that they don't limit themselves in how many credits they issue rather than saying, and this is a fine distinction,
[24:13] but rather than saying they issue unlimited credits. Because those two different ways of saying the same thing,
[24:19] they kind of bring two different images to mind, at least they do for me.
[24:22] The first one just says, okay, we don't have a set number that we picked,
[24:28] but we always have a number, right? There's always a knowable finite amount
[24:32] of credits we have issued. Whereas the other way of saying it,
[24:36] the unlimited way, the unlimited supply way of saying it, that makes it sound that just like credits
[24:41] are just like shooting out of a machine, uncontrollably falling from the sky in chaos.
[24:47] So in any case, it is that notion that we will now talk about.
[24:54] And so here is the first comment about such things. So over the weekend, Tante Stefana said,
[25:07] "Rion, so in your presentation, "you're advocating that we give up Austrian economics
[25:11] "and go back to Keynesian economics, "which leads to inflation and corruption.
[25:16] "How do you keep from the future increase of supply "continuing as the USD is doing?
[25:22] "It is dying and may collapse." Now, Rion, I know you answered this already on Discord,
[25:28] but not everybody's on Discord for their health probably. So do you care to share your answer again here?
[25:37] - Well, if you could just bring the quote back up again on the screen.
[25:41] - Yeah. - The last part, I think,
[25:44] is the most important part to address, which is how do you keep from the future?
[25:51] It's dying and may collapse. The US dollar is dying and may collapse.
[25:55] Is that true? No.
[26:04] I understand where people are coming from when they are frustrated with the state
[26:10] of the US dollar system or just national fiat currencies in general.
[26:15] I think part of it is, I always look at them,
[26:20] I always look at this from the lens of two perspectives, the ethics and the economics.
[26:27] And I think part of the reason that people are frustrated is they just don't like,
[26:32] they don't feel that the system is fair. They don't feel that it's right.
[26:37] And that's whether or not the system is ethical or not. And then the other part of it is
[26:43] they don't feel like it's creating prosperity. And they don't feel like they're personally gaining
[26:51] from the system and other people are gaining. But if you look at the US dollar system,
[26:56] objectively, it is by far the most successful monetary system that we've seen.
[27:04] Even if you look at the dollar, the DXY index, it's going up.
[27:10] So, and in terms of other, so the DXY index is basically a basket of currencies
[27:18] that the dollar trades against, such as like euros and Japanese yen
[27:24] and other currency pairs that we trade against, volume-weighted, I think.
[27:30] And is the dollar doing better or worse than that basket? You could look at it kind of like
[27:36] the Bitcoin dominance index. Like how is Bitcoin doing
[27:40] compared to all of the other alt coins? The DXY is kind of like how is the dollar doing
[27:45] compared to all of the other fiat currencies? And it's going up.
[27:50] So, regardless of what you think about the ethics of the system,
[27:55] or whether it's benefiting you personally, objectively, it's doing better
[27:59] than anything else right now. It's also, so if you measure it against gold,
[28:04] which a lot of people would bring up, it depends on your time perspective
[28:09] of how well that's doing. But maybe you could bring up the quote one more time again.
[28:14] I won't spend too much more time on this, but first of all, no, absolutely not.
[28:21] Not suggesting giving up Austrian economics. Austrian economics is what I consider
[28:26] just mostly economics. Like good economics.
[28:29] It's the foundation on which we build. We build.
[28:36] So, it has mostly to do with how we as individual people interact with our economies
[28:46] and how we interact with each other and trade. Those concepts are absolutely fundamental.
[28:53] - Human action, praxeology. - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[28:56] So, like economics is the study of human action and why we do things and what ends we're striving for.
[29:04] So, that all is absolutely good stuff. When you compare that with Keynesian economics,
[29:13] like Keynesianism is actually somewhat in between in the spectrum of, like I've talked about already,
[29:18] in between the spectrum of what level of government control and influence the economy should have.
[29:28] So, I'm not advocating that at all. I think another part of the problem here
[29:37] is that people view money creation, they look at how the Federal Reserve
[29:45] and the government work together to fund each other and support each other.
[29:51] So, like the Federal Reserve has a grant from the government to be the monopoly issuer of bank notes, for example,
[30:00] and they both benefit from that because then the Federal Reserve can come around
[30:06] and fund the government. Now, none of that has anything to do
[30:09] with what we're doing in Dash because we're not a government, right?
[30:14] We don't have a coercive taxation system at all. So, a lot of the arguments against like Keynesianism
[30:22] or modern monetary theory, they go out the window
[30:27] with applying some of those principles to Dash because we're not funding a government
[30:36] with this monetary system. We're funding a free market economy.
[30:41] And so, you have to separate the ethical and the economic issues
[30:46] and see are there principles in Keynesianism or modern monetary theory
[30:52] that if divorced from the bad ethical systems that they're in currently entrenched in,
[31:00] is there something that they have to offer in terms of the economics
[31:03] and in terms of like what actually works in an economy? And I think that's where the Austrians kind of go wrong
[31:12] or they don't recognize that we can build a system that is divorced from the governments of the world
[31:22] but still has some of those Keynesian and modern monetary theory
[31:27] and free banking principles in them, but embedded into a free market economy.
[31:34] And so, you have to reshape your whole paradigm when you're separating those kinds of things
[31:42] from our modern governmentally controlled systems. So, it's kind of hard to explain, but.
[31:48] - Well, it might a fair parallel be that we're talking about tools
[31:55] and tools can be used for totally opposing purposes. Like basically when people say like,
[32:02] oh, I don't wanna say anything controversial, but think of a tool
[32:07] and think of the two different camps that you've seen on both sides.
[32:11] One say, this tool must be banned because sometimes evil people use it for evil deeds.
[32:16] But then you have the other camp being like, whoa, what about when good people use it for good deeds?
[32:20] It's just a tool. It's inherently neutral.
[32:23] - I think that the example that most people or maybe even you would come up with is guns.
[32:28] And those can be used for good or bad. But I think a better example
[32:33] is something like nuclear power or nuclear, the technology of creating nuclear reactions.
[32:42] You can use that to create atomic bombs to devastate entire countries with one push of a button
[32:56] or you can use that to create energy that fuels an economy and lowers input costs
[33:03] to everything that we create. And so that's an example of a technology
[33:08] that I think if you only looked at governments using nuclear technology to create atomic bombs,
[33:17] then you would probably have a bad taste in your mouth for nuclear technology,
[33:21] but you would be missing the opportunity that you can have creating nuclear power.
[33:27] And I didn't catch that comment. So maybe you could bring it back up on the screen.
[33:31] I don't know if it was relevant to what we're talking about right now.
[33:34] - I don't. - Okay. - Not right now, yeah. - Okay.
[33:36] - But thank you for making it. - So that's how I view the monetary system as well
[33:41] is it is a neutral tool. Creating money is a neutral tool.
[33:47] And if you only look at that from the perspective of, oh, there are hundreds of evil governments
[33:53] that have used money creation to subjugate their populations
[33:59] and then you would have a bad taste in your mouth for any kind of money printing.
[34:05] And you might be inclined to go back to what nature has given us as a monetary tool,
[34:10] which is gold and silver. To me, that's kind of like saying,
[34:15] well, I think about just something very basic like a chair. Like, okay, well, we've invented chairs
[34:24] or we first thought about chairs when the first time somebody cut down a tree
[34:30] to create a house and then he sat on a tree stump and used that as a chair, something like that.
[34:35] And so you might think, okay, well, we have chairs now. But obviously, you can evolve that design
[34:43] and so instead of sitting on tree stumps your whole life, you can create a nice, comfortable chair
[34:49] and then maybe even a recliner chair at some point. Those require design and you use that technology
[34:57] to your advantage and you would be foolish to just continue using the nature-given technology
[35:04] of a tree stump as a chair. And so I think that's what we're doing
[35:07] with money these days is we're hearkening back to commodities as like, this was the most reliable chair.
[35:15] It never fell down. But-
[35:18] - Well, Rion, if I can disagree with you there, I think it actually makes, for someone who says,
[35:25] I want commodity money and commodity money only, give me gold and silver and if not, go to hell,
[35:30] actually that makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense to me is pretending
[35:35] that Dash can somehow be commodity money. - Right, it's not in its nature.
[35:40] - Pretending that Dash can be a digital gold. It can't, it's zeros and ones in people's hard drives.
[35:46] It's just a credit system, a digital credit system at that. And so-
[35:50] - Well, yeah, we've abstracted away the essence of money. We've made that technology and we've created
[35:56] that technology and we know what money is and what money can do and just hearkening back
[36:02] on how money became money is missing the point. It's just, I don't know.
[36:07] It is against the nature of our monetary systems to go back to that.
[36:14] - Well, Tante Stefana did then say, Rion, as you may remember,
[36:19] want you to know that I'm re-listening to your presentations and researching MMT, Modern Monetary Theory,
[36:25] and I'm trying to open my mind to your proposal, but with limited time and bandwidth to my brain,
[36:30] it'll take me a while. So that from hardliner Tante Stefana, that is good news.
[36:37] Next from Dandy, he said, that's what all of the politicians say.
[36:43] You can't have a mechanism in the system for money creation by an outside force or it will get abused
[36:49] with 100% certainty sooner or later. And if I can, I would like to take a stab at this initially.
[36:57] - Go ahead. - So I actually agree with Dandy, 100%.
[37:04] I agree with his statement that sooner or later, every man-made system will get abused with 100% certainty.
[37:13] - I don't agree with that, but go ahead. - Yeah, so I actually gave,
[37:19] I don't think anybody recorded it, so you might just have to take my word for this,
[37:23] but I attended the Libertopia Conference some five or six years ago.
[37:28] I think it was in, I don't know, somewhere in Southern California.
[37:32] And I presented a moderately attended, maybe even low attended talk,
[37:39] because this is not a very popular thing or exciting thing, I guess I say, but my belief is that like man,
[37:47] who will one day, all men will eventually, their bodies will corrupt and one day they will die.
[37:54] I believe that so too, all systems created by men will similarly eventually corrupt and one day die.
[38:02] But I don't let that belief prevent me from, prime example, from having a child, right?
[38:15] I still chose to have a child, even with the knowledge that one day his body will corrupt
[38:20] and one day die. I wouldn't let my beliefs prevent me from planting a tree,
[38:25] even though I know that one day that tree will corrupt and one day die.
[38:31] And so I hope that if you share my belief, as it sounds like you do, Dandy,
[38:38] that one day Dash will corrupt and die, which by the way, would happen whether or not
[38:44] we altered the supply cap economics, right? If this is a true principle,
[38:51] Dash will corrupt and die one day anyway. I hope that we don't let our fear of the eventual death
[38:59] of the system that we have put our hearts and souls and minds into, that we don't let that prevent us
[39:06] from living to the fullest in the interim. Exercising our capacities and pursuing our potential
[39:16] to its absolute fullest and trying to make that lifespan for however long it is,
[39:22] be as long as we can possibly make it. - Yeah, I see your point there.
[39:29] I think, yeah, we're looking at it from a little bit different perspectives.
[39:33] Yes, everything that is born eventually can die and usually does die.
[39:40] But yeah, I just, I don't like this idea that everything that man is capable,
[39:49] everything that man is capable of being corrupted in, that they will succumb to that.
[39:54] I just, I don't like that concept. I don't think it's true.
[39:58] I think that we are capable of achieving good or bad and like the tool discussion,
[40:06] everybody has the choice whether to use tools for good or bad and everybody has the choice
[40:11] whether they will succumb to corruption or not. And it's just a very bleak look, view of the world
[40:18] to think that every time that man comes in contact with a tool that can be used for good or bad,
[40:23] they'll choose the bad part. It's just not, I don't think that's how it works.
[40:29] And to your point, I think that the dash is, or at least can be, very much closer to its birth
[40:36] than its death, depending on what we do with it. If you look at our charts, it looks like we,
[40:45] at least market cap, or you could look at users as well. It looks like we peaked out in something like 2017.
[40:52] And as far as I'm concerned, that could be a blip on the radar in terms of what we have
[40:59] as far as our potential goes. It just depends on whether we will build it or not.
[41:04] And that's why we always, I always like to start our conversations
[41:09] with a recap on why we're building. And yeah, I think it's not going to happen on its own though.
[41:17] That's one of the other things that I see as a theme of, particularly a lot of the Austrians and libertarian types,
[41:25] is they have so much faith in this, the market, and that they feel like the market will take care of it.
[41:32] Just let it organically build itself. Well, no, like things don't organically build themselves.
[41:39] You can't get to the moon by just hoping that somebody else will take care of it.
[41:43] Somebody has to do the engineering. Somebody has to do the design, the building.
[41:50] And that's what we need to do, is we need to actually take an active role
[41:54] in building this economy. It's not going to just build itself.
[41:58] The economies around us will encompass us and just devour us if we just sit around
[42:06] and hope that this economy will build itself. It won't, like we have to create incentives
[42:16] for people to work in this economy. And that's part of this concept as well,
[42:23] is I know that this is kind of getting to be a philosophical discussion,
[42:28] but I think you have to start with that foundation because otherwise you're not going to build a system
[42:35] that's actually sustainable. I do like to get into the nuts and bolts of building
[42:42] and not just talking about the philosophical and talking, talking, talking,
[42:49] but it's a necessary but not sufficient thing to talk about like the concepts.
[42:56] And then you can get, once you have a firm foundation of the concepts that you're aiming for
[43:05] and the fundamentals, then you can actually start implementing.
[43:09] But you can't just, I think that's another problem with a lot of these cryptocurrency projects
[43:15] is they were viewed mostly as technological projects where it was just all 100% engineering
[43:24] and no thought about the economics or the ethics behind them.
[43:31] And so we build a lot on, we focus a lot on the engineering
[43:37] and we forget to focus on the ethical and the economic foundations of what we're trying to build.
[43:45] So let's, yeah, go ahead and. - Okay.
[43:50] Great Wolf said, "The idea that any one person "is smart enough to say what will generate value
[43:55] "for the network and therefore that's enough justification "to change and inflate the supply
[44:00] "from what it's originally designed, "that is just venturing into the territory of fiat."
[44:06] - Yeah, I've kind of talked about this a little bit. I don't know what he's, I like Great Wolf.
[44:14] Great Wolf is amazing. He's very, very technically well grounded in this project.
[44:21] I've seen him help AJ out with a lot of our technical issues.
[44:30] But I'm not sure what he's talking about with one person. One person is not able to create,
[44:39] he's responding just for the context. He's responding to my suggestion
[44:45] that we increase the supply cap and be able to create new currency
[44:51] as we're able to add value. - Well, and it's no longer one person.
[44:56] It's at least two people now, because I'm suggesting that. And actually, ironically--
[45:01] - It never happens without the masternodes. So the masternodes would still vote.
[45:05] And so it would always be actually a very significant super majority of the stakeholders of Dash
[45:11] that would be in charge of the money creation. So this one person thing, I don't know.
[45:16] - Well, and ironically enough, actually Dash's current program supply cap
[45:21] was one might be able to say selected by one person, which was Evan.
[45:26] So if Evan wasn't smart enough to decide it on his own, and Rion's not smart enough to decide it on his own,
[45:31] then I suppose that the masternodes should collectively decide.
[45:34] - Yeah, exactly. That's a very good point.
[45:38] In fact, it was more or less, I mean, there were more than one,
[45:42] it was more than just Evan, but it was mostly Evan that decided the supply schedule.
[45:48] And that is just, why would we think that that's 100% accurate
[45:54] to for a decade out or 100 years out that that would be the optimal supply curve?
[46:03] - And speaking of that, I would like to bring up one comment that was left.
[46:06] I don't remember if it was Dandy or Great Wolf. I think it was Dandy.
[46:09] But he said something to the effect of, if we change the supply schedule once,
[46:17] then what is to prevent investors from losing confidence when they know that it may well be changed again
[46:26] in the future? And I would say that by definition,
[46:30] investors are not people who are committed to there being no changes,
[46:37] and they're not people who are committed to there being change all the time.
[46:41] Investors are just seeking returns, profit. And so I would say that investors would have cause
[46:51] to lose confidence in Dash based on what has happened over the past five years
[46:56] with the 98% loss of purchasing power. That is what has caused investors to lose confidence.
[47:02] Making changes to try to prevent this horror show from happening ever again,
[47:08] I would say would inspire investors to gain confidence. - Yeah, just one thought that came to mind
[47:14] when you said that. I think it's important to,
[47:17] instead of probably somewhat pessimistically, we look at the decline in value
[47:24] from the peak that we've ever had. So whatever it was, $1,600 per Dash,
[47:30] and then we see that decline, and so we say we've lost 98% from that.
[47:34] It's important to also recognize that we came from zero. So we can't just pick that one number
[47:40] and say that we've declined 98%. Well, we've also increased hundreds of percents from,
[47:49] technically we've increased infinity percent from where we started, which was zero.
[47:54] So yeah, that's just one thing that I would say is, let's focus on the positive that we've done,
[48:02] which is we're still here. And we've grown from a market cap of zero
[48:07] to a market cap of whatever we are now, 350 million or something like that.
[48:14] Let's keep doing that. We don't have to just cherry pick this one number
[48:17] that happened as a completely speculative fluke that lasted maybe a month or two, not even that.
[48:26] Like the 1,600 number basically lasted one day and there was probably almost no volume there.
[48:32] So it doesn't even make sense to focus on that. - It lasted forever in my mind, just kidding.
[48:39] I only heard about it after the fact. I only heard about it days later.
[48:43] - Yeah, yeah. So yeah, the point is, we've grown from zero to 350 million
[48:49] and we could continue to grow if we wanted to, but we have to engineer the system properly
[48:54] with good ethics and good economics. - All right.
[48:59] And then final, this is the final comment here from David Holiday.
[49:03] He said, "The thing is you want to deliver with less first. And if you can prove that, then increase.
[49:09] But we haven't shown we can deliver with less. As parents would say, finish what's on your plate first
[49:16] and then you get dessert." So Rion, I'm not sure how you interpret this.
[49:20] I interpret this as saying that David thinks that thus far MNOs have made overwhelmingly poor choices
[49:29] and thus cannot and should not be entrusted with more resources.
[49:34] - Yeah. Yeah, and it's a valid point.
[49:37] And I would say that the problem there is not necessarily with money creation itself,
[49:42] it's the problem with what we've done with that money creation.
[49:46] And he might agree with that. So that the problem might be the MNO.
[49:49] - Later he did actually. - Yeah, but that's orthogonal to use a fancy term.
[49:56] That's completely a different, that's a different issue altogether
[50:02] than money creation itself. That's an issue of who we've entrusted
[50:11] the money, that money allocation to. And so don't blame, well, I guess his point is that
[50:19] if that's his point, then we should just- - I would say Dash is doomed regardless, right?
[50:26] If it's true, if MNOs are incurably stupid and are incapable of setting themselves a right,
[50:35] then Dash is doomed regardless. And so if his argument is that lifting the supply,
[50:41] the arbitrary supply cap, maybe his argument is, hey, Dash will die within a year
[50:47] because of how stupid we are. Whereas at least if we keep this
[50:51] arbitrarily chosen supply cap, maybe we'll live another five years.
[50:55] Okay, but if that's really the case, I would much rather we die within the year
[51:00] so that I can move on with my life and do something else, right?
[51:04] So if we really are too stupid to live, let's please just die sooner than later.
[51:08] That would be my take. - I think regardless,
[51:10] I think we have made mistakes in the past. I think one of our mistakes was allowing our currency
[51:17] to appreciate so quickly and everybody just got so greedy and said, hey, we can live on appreciation forever
[51:27] and we can just sit on our hands and not do anything and our currency will just continue to go up.
[51:34] No, like when that was happening, we should have had a more flexible currency supply back then
[51:42] we should have been issuing more currency to kind of put a lid on that appreciation
[51:48] and investing that currency creation into things that would create value
[51:56] and bring value down the road so that down the road when the speculative hype lessened,
[52:02] then we would have value to bolster it back up again and create more stability.
[52:08] So right now, like with this inelastic currency supply, we are just destined to have price fluctuations
[52:16] that are to the moon and to the grave and back again. And that's not how a good monetary system works.
[52:25] You have to have more stability and that involves some mechanism to adjust the supply
[52:33] to help meet the demand in both directions, right? And those are the kind of things to bring this back
[52:44] to the original concepts of credit creation and money creation and banking functions
[52:53] and venture capital functions. Those are, this is, I think just the beginning
[53:00] of these conversations, like none of us in Dash have the expertise to design this system
[53:08] so that it's a functioning and stable economy. Like we need outside help from experts in banking,
[53:17] like you said, in banking and in business creation, the venture, that's why I focused on the venture capital.
[53:26] They have a history and proof of knowing how to create value in an economy.
[53:32] We need economists. And there's, if you look at government systems
[53:42] and our current financial or fiat systems, they employ hundreds, thousands of economists
[53:52] to do things and to design their systems. We need to do something similar.
[53:57] And there are a lot of free market economists that we could employ in Dash to help build our system.
[54:04] A lot of venture capitalists that we could employ to help build value and create value.
[54:10] And we haven't done that in the past. And that has been one of our mistakes, I think,
[54:16] is we thought that we could get by without VCs. Our mistake wasn't, and I agree,
[54:26] like we don't wanna take VCs money, but we want and we need VCs to create our money
[54:33] and to create value in our system. And that's been, I've kind of realized that for a while now,
[54:39] but that was my presentation. I know that it's controversial to bring up,
[54:46] which is why I have not brought it up as much in the past, but we're getting to a point
[54:52] where we just need to concede that we've done things poorly in the past
[54:57] and we need to learn from those mistakes. And maybe it's true that MNOs can't figure this out.
[55:04] And that will be sad, that we will just keep doing what we've been doing
[55:09] and hoping and hoping and hoping that the speculative demand is coming.
[55:16] It's coming. It's not coming.
[55:20] We have to do the hard work of creating value and not just siphoning value off of speculative demand
[55:25] from fiat. So I guess those are kind of my closing remarks.
[55:31] - Okay. Well, yeah, that works.
[55:35] I'm looking forward to moving forward. I wish I didn't just say that same word twice in a row,
[55:43] with the creation of this roadmap. And I will learn you how to use GitHub,
[55:50] the monstrosity that it is, because this is important to me.
[55:54] This is exciting to me. Thanks for accepting the concept into the incubator.
[56:00] Thanks Doc Agnew for having submitted the concept that is like the umbrella parent of this one.
[56:07] And yeah, that's all we have for you today, folks. - We are, just, can I say one more thing?
[56:13] We are, I think that it is going to be, it'll be interesting to see if the community supports this.
[56:25] 'Cause my concern, my big concern, is that people are a little tired
[56:30] of the economics discussion already. And you and I think and know that this is just the beginning.
[56:38] Like we need a lot, there's a lot of work to be done here. And your roadmap is just the beginning of that.
[56:46] So I hope that people can continue to support the incubator.
[56:50] I know that some have threatened to remove support just because we've even brought the subject up,
[56:55] but hopefully people can see that we need to try something new and something different
[57:01] to create value here. So with that, I guess I'll really be done.
[57:07] - Amen. - All right. - (indistinct)
[57:11] - Thanks everybody. Bye.
