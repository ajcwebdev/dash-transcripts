The transcript discusses implementing a self-service merchant loyalty credit system on the Dash network.

tl;dr: This episode explores the concept of enabling merchants to issue their own loyalty credits or gift cards denominated in fiat currency, utilizing the Dash network infrastructure. This system would allow merchants to create and sell credits to customers without needing intermediaries. The credits would be backed by the merchant's goods, services, and reputation. The discussion covers the potential benefits for merchants, the technical aspects of implementation, and how it could drive real-world adoption of Dash.

00:00 - Introduction and Background Information
The episode begins with information about the decline in cash usage in Australia and the RBA's efforts to develop a CBDC.

04:12 - Introduction of Guest and Concept
Introduction of guest Yon (formerly Max) and the recently accepted concept about merchant credits to be discussed.

11:06 - Explanation of the Merchant Credit System Concept
Yon explains the concept of merchants issuing their own loyalty credits or gift cards denominated in fiat currency, utilizing the Dash network infrastructure.

23:04 - Differences Between the Proposed System and Existing Solutions
The discussion covers how this system differs from existing solutions like Dash Direct and gift card providers, emphasizing the benefits of a permissionless, self-service platform.

34:51 - Potential Challenges and Benefits for Merchants and Customers
Potential challenges and benefits for merchants and customers are explored, including the appeal to small and medium-sized businesses and the advantages for customers who earn in cryptocurrency.

51:01 - Technical Aspects and Comparison to Other Networks
The technical aspects of implementing the system on the Dash network are discussed, along with comparisons to other networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.

58:50 - Importance of User Experience and Final Thoughts
The importance of a user-friendly experience for merchants and customers is emphasized. The episode concludes with final thoughts on the potential of the project and a call for interested contributors to get involved.

[00:00] "The number of consumer transactions done in cash has plummeted down from 70% in 2016 to 13% last year."
[00:33] Further cash accounted for just 6% of value transacted in 2022. In the last 5 years, the number of ATMs in Australia has decreased from 14,000 to 6,000.
[00:43] In the last 5 years, the number of bank branches in Australia has decreased from about 5,700 to 3,600, and some of the remaining bank branches have ceased handling cash altogether.
[00:53] Those who prefer to use cash will have a more difficult time accessing it, especially if they live outside a major city, and it has been floated that they may soon be required
[01:00] to pay a premium to access cash. "Well, the days of cold, hard cash could well be numbered, with the Reserve Bank Governor
[01:07] warning the steep decline in cash transactions might well lead to Aussies being charged to use their own banknotes."
[01:15] According to many talking heads, this is a good thing, because digital payments are more efficient and because they create a paper trail for tax revenues, while Bullock, who
[01:23] has no work experience outside the RBA, has paid lip service to cash, it seems she is content to see it be supplanted.
[01:30] As they say, actions speak louder than words, and Bullock and her colleagues have been busy laying the groundwork for another system.
[01:36] In 2018, the RBA spearheaded the new payments platform, which facilitates instantaneous 24/7 peer-to-peer payments for those who have registered with their bank.
[01:45] The majority of adults in Australia have signed up and are users. The RBA has been working on a CBDC since at least 2020.
[01:52] Indeed, Australia's CBDC is already in the pilot stage, the step just prior to being launched.
[01:57] In 2021, the RBA began collaboration with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre, or DFCRC, an outfit funded by the Australian Federal Government, banks, fintech companies,
[02:07] and academia. In 2022, the RBA and DFCRC announced their pending, year-long study into CBDCs, and this
[02:14] past August, they released their report. They had collaborated with the largest banks and other payment institutions to run 16 use
[02:21] cases, from onboarding users, to remittances, to the bond market, to the tokenization of assets, to offline payments, to a payment app.
[02:28] Their findings were shared at an invite-only conference, which was spearheaded by Dilip Rao, Ripple's former Global Head of Infrastructure Innovation.
[02:36] Earlier this month, Rao published a write-up about CBDCs. It began by mentioning Facebook's Libra project, which, Rao noted, "may have struck
[02:43] fear and loathing in the hearts of central bankers everywhere." Why?
[02:47] Because banksters are afraid of losing power. Rao then wrote, "Central banks are today racing to work out if, when, and how they
[02:53] should counter the 'crypto barbarians' at the gates with their own central bank digital currency."
[02:58] This view is shared by Stephen Jones, Australia's Minister for Financial Services and Assistant Treasurer, who said at a press conference last year that "cryptocurrency is a challenge
[03:07] that needs regulation." Rao's conclusion largely echoes what Augustin Karstens, Head of the Bank for International
[03:12] Settlements is fond of saying, that "Governments cannot foist CBDCs upon the populace. They must first cultivate political will for them to be accepted."
[03:19] Thus, Rao and his colleagues are not overtly pushing an Australian CBDC. Considered, during her recent comments about payments and cash, Bullitt chose not to mention
[03:27] the "considerable research" that's been undertaken into an Australian CBDC. They are laying the groundwork, including trying to control the narrative, with the
[03:34] help of their friends in the fourth branch of government, the mainstream media. The bulk of legacy media is not just giving press to those who praise going cashless,
[03:42] they are vilifying cryptocurrency by associating it with scams that need regulation. And the big four Australian banks have discussed curtailing customer ability to interact with
[03:50] centralized cryptocurrency exchanges under the guise of protecting them from scams. But the future is not written, the narrative is not wholly controlled.
[04:07] Australians, no need to chuck a Wobbly or have a Barney, there's still time for this situation to make a Yui.
[04:12] No time to be a bludger, you must act. Think how your decision will impact not just yourself but the next generation.
[04:18] You'd be ace if you were a mad cunt and broached this convo with those in your sphere, including the Garbos.
[04:23] Again, the Paulys and their bankster friends are scrambling, now is the time to bypass that system of control and instead use a means of exchange that is liberating.
[04:30] As Keanu Reeves' character Neo said in the movie The Matrix, which was shot in Australia. Shoutout Barbarians, Happy New Year!
[05:05] You can see I've got my four back here. Yes, and I'm especially pleased at how it's turned the other way from how fours are usually
[05:16] turned. It's like you're just keeping it fresh and mixed.
[05:19] Well, I don't know, does it come out backwards because I don't know if I've got my screen mirrored or not, but anyway, I had it there for my 40th birthday, I think, or something
[05:31] like that. Anyway.
[05:33] Well, great. Well, everybody, you are joining the Incubator Weekly in which our newest contributor, Yon,
[05:41] who was using the handle Max prior to creating a new one called Yon, for ease, has submitted a recently accepted concept about which I know very little, and it has to do with merchant
[05:56] credits. I'm going to ask Ryan to give us an overview of why he accepted that into the Incubator
[06:06] here in a moment, but before we do, we just want to say hello to Yon and say what's up. So, Yon, how's it going?
[06:15] It's fine, 2024 here as well, and I'm glad to be on the show. Would you tell us how and when you first learned of Dash?
[06:29] Well, that was actually quite from the beginning, I guess, 2014, that was. Yeah, well, my background is in academia, so I'm interested, or I was always interested
[06:49] in all technical stuff and different technologies. So I learned about Bitcoin, not right at the beginning, but like around 2013, and about
[07:03] Dash 2014, I found it a cool project, like kind of pushing forward the basic ideas of Bitcoin.
[07:15] And yeah, I like your show, Amanda, at that time, Dash Detail, or how was it called afterwards? I forgot what it's called.
[07:29] Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that was quite nice and refreshing at the time as well.
[07:36] And yeah, I actually had some, I exchanged a few emails with Ivan Duffield when he was starting, I guess, some more development people to join the team.
[07:52] I had exchanged a few emails with him that was something about sending objects and how to execute them on virtual machine.
[08:01] But at the time, I did not have time, I was not interested in joining the team. But since then, a lot of water flew, and years passed, and I'm not at the university anymore.
[08:19] I was a consultant for a few years, then we had small kids. So I took it easier.
[08:26] And now I'm kind of at the crossroad. And I still think crypto is cool.
[08:34] And I'm interested in trying to do my best and contribute with this project or with this idea to Dash community, or maybe to crypto in general, you will see.
[08:51] Wow. Well, I like that attitude.
[08:54] The trying to contribute as much as you can to make it work, because that's the only way that it will work.
[09:02] I mean, these cryptocurrency projects are only as good as the people and labor force behind them, actually making it into a marketable good.
[09:13] So yeah, we can't just sit and pray for investors to keep dumping money into speculation, we've got to make real world value.
[09:22] So to pick up on your earlier question, Amanda, why I accepted this concept, it is for that very reason, actually.
[09:32] Dash is digital cash. We want it to be a widely used and commonly used digital cash, in other words, money.
[09:42] And a big part of that, as I just said, the labor force is what you put into the coin and what you get out is hopefully goods and services.
[09:55] And the coin is just in the middle, facilitating those exchanges of labor and goods. And this concept that you have here, maybe somebody can put it up on the screen, Pete,
[10:08] I've shared my screen. This concept is exactly that, we're looking at the merchant side.
[10:16] And we know historically that it's been difficult to get merchants to and actually maybe I'll just I'll just talk for a little bit longer, but glad to know that you've got it ready.
[10:28] Good to know, it's the merchant side is difficult to get them to accept cryptocurrency directly. I think that we are making some inroads on that, and I think that it will become even
[10:42] more popular in the future. But right now, merchants, they really just want dollars coming in, because that's how
[10:51] they do their accounting. And any way that we can help them do that, if accepting cryptocurrency directly is a
[10:58] little bit too much of a stretch for them, then maybe this concept is a bridge to get them there.
[11:06] And this concept, now let's take a look at it specifically is where Jan originally titled it self-service merchant loyalty credit system.
[11:20] And I've shortened that a little bit in our project, but I'll just read the value proposition here.
[11:28] Enable payments at point of sale using merchant-specific self-issued loyalty credits, which are denominated in chosen national fiat currency, and which are implemented on top of Dash Evolution infrastructure
[11:44] as a permissionless feature. So basically what I'm hearing from that is, this is kind of a gift card that merchants
[11:57] can create to sell to customers, and then they can denominate that gift card in US dollars or whatever currency they want.
[12:08] They could even denominate it in Dash, potentially, if they wanted to. But now that I've just kind of introduced the concept, I'd like you, Jan, to describe
[12:18] it a little bit further. I'm all about using Dash in the real world and merchant adoption.
[12:26] That's why I accepted this card, but let us know what further detail you had in mind. So there's a lot of things about this project at the moment because it has been hanging
[12:46] around maybe for a year, but I guess to start with how I came to that idea, maybe that's also interesting.
[12:54] Please, we've obviously been thinking about it for a while. Because there was a lot of bickering on the Discord about these stablecoins.
[13:05] How to do it, how difficult is it, what are different possibilities, like this completely automated pack like Terra Luna used or something that is backed by other assets like DAI and
[13:30] MakerDAO uses. And also, I have a feeling that this entire crypto sector is completely, a lot of new
[13:42] asset classes like cryptocurrency for payments or Bitcoin as one new asset class. But then you have all these ICOs and NFTs, and then you have exchange tokens.
[14:00] So there's a lot of new asset classes, but they are all like digital new and it's just pure speculation that you need to connect cryptocurrency to the real world, to real
[14:15] usage, to real assets. And of course, money is sort of a real asset, although it does not exist anyway, it's only
[14:24] in our heads. But many people will tell you that dollars are real.
[14:28] So the stablecoins are sort of the connection to the real world. And it's also probably the most useful and successful asset or application of cryptocurrencies,
[14:43] the stablecoins. But the problem is how you do, how you run these stablecoins.
[14:50] You need to take a lot of risk and the regulatory pressure. And I don't know what legal problems and back the asset and make it secure.
[15:06] So I was then thinking about whether you can use it directly for daily usage. And I came to this idea that if we want to use it on day to day basis, the best would
[15:21] be if the merchants who are selling the goods and services could back the cryptographic asset with their goods and services.
[15:35] So basically what you get is a stablecoin, but it's sharded by all these merchants and service providers who are willing to utilize Dash network.
[15:54] And they are issuing their stablecoins denominated in their currency that their business is using. And it's backed by their goods and services and by their reputation.
[16:11] And they cannot exceed this power they have. They care about their customers.
[16:21] So it also keeps them in the corner. So this kind of issuance problem would be solved with that.
[16:31] And it would bring usage of Dash network to the real world assets, to the real world services and goods.
[16:45] And now the question is how to do it. So we can talk about it.
[16:49] Yeah. Before you, I feel like my brain is kind of like pulsing with possibilities here.
[16:54] And I'm like, whoa, this is potentially super awesome what you're saying. I'm sure it is super awesome.
[17:01] I just, could I get an example, like an example of me as a merchant or me as a customer? Yeah.
[17:09] So I have actually, I've been thinking about it in preparation for this New Year's Eve podcast.
[17:21] So actually I found out the best is to go through the procedure. So I will just tell you the procedure, how it would work, and then we can ask.
[17:32] So the first step is to convince the merchant about the benefits they will have when using these payment credits.
[17:43] Okay. They are several and we will get to it later.
[17:47] But this is the first step. You need to convince the merchant.
[17:51] A convinced merchant or one willing to try this concept out installs the application on their mobile device.
[18:03] This means pretty much the same as if you install a Dash mobile wallet, apart from the installation from the app store itself, you will also need to perform some initialization
[18:16] of the wallets, namely like choosing and keeping the, and then storing the private key. So they need to do that as well.
[18:25] And then they will need to set up their merchant credit for the, for their own business and for their brands.
[18:33] So that basically means they need to choose a name. They might choose a logo.
[18:39] They might set that address to the merchant itself. The currency in which they want to carry the payments and perhaps the minimum denomination
[18:51] they are willing to accept through this, through this method. And with that, they are ready to issue and sell their own merchant credits to their customers.
[19:04] So it's a completely self-service permissionless app or. So if I'm like a grocery store, if I'm like the apple, the apple orchard grocery store,
[19:18] I, if I've been persuaded, if I've been convinced I am issuing gift cards or credits, say in the minimum denomination of five Aussie dollars.
[19:31] No, I think this would be, no, no, this would be like the minimum change that you are accepting. So let's say 10 cents or 1 cent, like, you know, you, you say you, you are in dollars.
[19:47] So okay. US dollars is the currency and the minimum change is, let's say 5 cents or 10 cents or
[19:56] 50 cents. It's up to you.
[19:58] Okay. Okay.
[20:00] And then, and then I issue these. No.
[20:03] Okay. I will get to it.
[20:05] Okay. I will get to it.
[20:08] So, so right now, right now you convince the merchant, you have the merchant install the application and you have the merchant with their settings for their, for their credits.
[20:19] So it's then up to the merchant how they will promote it. But the onboard, the onboarding of customers basically means pointing the willing customers
[20:35] to the app store, to install the payment app as well. They will need to do that.
[20:42] And then potentially a different app. It's up to us.
[20:51] It's up to us how it will be, how it will be done. It can be the same.
[20:55] It can be different, which, which again, of course the, the customers, they will have to on the first launch, they need to establish a new account on, on, on the dash network.
[21:07] That's again, the same thing. So this is basically the technical setup until now you did not need any dash.
[21:14] There's no transaction. This is like the technical setup you need for this concept or this service to work.
[21:24] So then you have customer with the payment app and they can go to the merchant and buy their credits in their local currency.
[21:37] So let's say you like a restaurant or a grocery store on your street. So you may feel safe having a hundred dollars of credit with them because you use them every
[21:52] day. In fact, you might be willing to do that, especially if you get some benefits for that,
[21:57] like such as discounts. Yes.
[22:00] And since they are offering their credits, you go to the cashier and say, I want to buy a hundred bucks of, of your credits.
[22:10] So you pay a hundred bucks either in cash or in any other payment mechanism. They accepted the cashier such as credit card and you pay.
[22:21] So they have it in their system and you paid a hundred bucks. And in your app, you press add credits and there will be a QR code.
[22:30] You show it to the cashier, they scan it. And in seconds you get the credits in your app.
[22:37] Okay. So, so far I've heard that a merchant creates credit tokens and that a person can buy those
[22:46] credit tokens with dollars or euros or yen or what have you. Where does Dash come into, I mean, does, do Dash transactions come into play?
[22:56] Okay. Just, just, just, just, just wait a bit.
[22:58] I will, we will get to it, but let's say that this, let's say that this happens. Okay.
[23:04] It happened over Dash network. So obviously we will get to it.
[23:07] You will need, you will need Dash transaction just to happen because the Dash network is carrier of all of this.
[23:14] So, so yeah, so you have the credits of this merchant in your app and, and this is the first time basically when, when, when you need some Dash because you need to pay for
[23:32] fees on Dash network. You cannot, you cannot do it without, without that.
[23:37] And so the merchant needs to get some Dash before they issue, before they sell the credits to the customer because they need to pay for the fees on the Dash network.
[23:53] The, for the same reason or this on this issuance, the merchant should send some minimum amount of Dash to the, to the customer so that they can spend, so that they can use the credits
[24:07] then when they want to use them at, at the merchant in the later time. So, so basically the, the credits that the merchant creates, it's like out of thin air,
[24:25] but it is backed by, by their reputation, by their service, it's their customer. So they, it's backed by them basically.
[24:38] And but you need to pay, you need to create Dash transactions to, to communicate, to basically to make transactions.
[24:47] Yeah. Okay.
[24:49] I have a, I have a question about your use of the term credits. I think I know what it means, but can you just please clarify when you say a merchant
[24:58] issuing credits, is that equivalent to saying a merchant issuing a gift card? Yeah, you can, you can call it whatever you want.
[25:08] It's basically, it's basically you say, this is my money. This is my gift card.
[25:18] This is my loyalty money. This is my payment mechanism.
[25:25] And you say it's denominated in, in dollars because your business runs prices in dollars. So not to confuse the, the, the customer, it has the same denomination, but it is like
[25:37] a gift card. You can, you can say so.
[25:40] And it's a, but it's a, the important thing here is that it's a gift card that's issued directly by the merchant and stored securely and publicly, or maybe not publicly.
[25:53] Maybe there's some kind of securely, let's say, let's say securely on dash platform. And so they immersion, if they are a merchant that has, that wants a loyalty credit program
[26:04] or a gift card program, their option right now is they can contact some kind of gift card provider that, that they can then work with.
[26:14] And then the gift card provider will, will be their gift card as a service provider. And they'll, they'll probably, you know, not the merchant probably won't do much in terms
[26:24] of administering that program. But the downside for the merchant is they probably have to pay some kind of fee to this
[26:32] service provider and to get that up and running. So what you're saying is let's offer a self-service service where the merchant, they don't have
[26:42] to, they don't have to interface with any kind of service from merchant gift card or gift credit.
[26:49] Exactly. They just do it themselves.
[26:52] The data is stored on dash platform. And and then you, you mentioned also that.
[26:59] So right now we don't have any kind of dash payments have not entered the discussion as of yet, because this gift card system could be as simple as the merchant just gets this
[27:12] up and running and then they, they accept us dollars for their gift cards and they denominate it in us dollars, but you're, we're still using dash in this case because we're using
[27:24] dash platform, but it would just be a further, a further feature that the merchant could accept dash or the gift card if they wanted to, and customers could buy them with dash
[27:38] if they wanted to. Is this?
[27:40] Yeah, sure. Well, sure.
[27:42] So you are correct, but those are further developments. Also what I would, what you said is correct.
[27:51] Also what I would correct you on a little bit is the, the credits themselves. I mean, they can, they may not need to be on even on platform or on evolution, but as
[28:07] we discussed, perhaps it's a good idea to, to, to analyze and think about that road as well.
[28:17] The transactions as technically, when I was thinking about it and, and doing specification for it, that would be just a normal op codes or the, the, you know, the memo you could
[28:34] do it through these colored coins or that kind of application on, on dash network. What, but you would need, we need platform for the, for the settings and for definition
[28:49] of each merchant credit. So there, so this cannot work without evolution.
[28:55] We need evolution first for this, once, once there will be a fungible, fungible tokens, or I don't know how is it called exactly how quantum explorer calls it.
[29:10] I think it's fungible tokens. One, the support for fungible tokens will be there.
[29:16] Then the credits, as I call them, or as we are talking about them here, could be on platform as well.
[29:24] Okay. Now that at the moment, okay, Pete, could you, could you flash up David holiday's question
[29:32] about this sounds like a dash direct what's the difference here? Because I think that some people will be asking this question.
[29:42] I think I have a good idea of what the difference is, but I would like you to explain what the difference is between this and what dash direct was doing.
[29:51] So there, there are many differences, but the, the core difference is we can put it together with bit ref fill as well.
[30:03] If you take bit ref fill or, or dash direct, those are services. Those are middleman's or middle intermediaries that are enabling you to use a credit, these
[30:17] gift cards or loyalty cards of, of others. So if you, if you use Amazon gift card, Amazon has their, their infrastructure for their
[30:32] gift cards, their system up where they control the issuance and the movements of, of usage of these gift cards and bit ref fill or this direct are the intermediaries that are allowing
[30:45] you to use these gift cards through cryptocurrency through using dash. So the major difference in there as well, like I know that when I've spoken with the
[30:58] support teams of these various gift card issuers, they're not even getting the gift cards directly from Amazon.
[31:05] They're getting them from a supplier who gets them from Amazon. It's like multiple middlemen.
[31:11] Yeah. There's probably multiple middlemen technically, but the conceptually you have, you have Amazon,
[31:20] Amazon gift card, that's one technology. And then of course we can talk about how you can move it around, but it, it, it runs on
[31:27] its own platform and you will have, you will have Adidas gift cards, you know, they, they have their own gift card system and you know, these big companies or chains, they have their
[31:40] own gift cards. The smaller ones cannot afford it because it's too expensive to carry out with this
[31:47] solution. That's not a middleman.
[31:49] So this is a dash network provides you a feature where anyone can create and put in a, in circulation their own gift cards and you do not need any infrastructure.
[32:06] It's, it's there waiting for you. It's permissionless and you can start, you just need dash to cover transaction, which
[32:15] is very low fees. It's a few cents.
[32:18] So I would imagine that this is going to appeal mostly to small to medium sized businesses because I think that most large businesses that already are interested in issuing a gift
[32:31] cards or, or in-store credits to their customers have probably already done so with such an intermediary.
[32:41] And, and even if they hadn't the bureaucracy involved might, they might want to use a big service for example.
[32:51] But if you have a local company that's a small business owner, maybe you even know the business owner and he's interested in having customers participate in a merchant loyalty program.
[33:06] He doesn't want to necessarily go through, he might not want to go through one of these big intermediaries because they might, they might charge too much to make it worth his
[33:16] time. Too expensive.
[33:18] Too expensive. But if you could have a turnkey solution for him that allows him to have this program and
[33:28] gain the loyalty of even two or three of his local customers, then I think that makes a lot of sense and Dash would be the only intermediary and using Dash would be very inexpensive for
[33:42] him because we have just an interest in people, getting people using this system, right? So I think, I think, I think it's not even that you cannot call Dash intermediary.
[33:55] It's the same like if you would say that for making Dash transaction, you use intermediary. No, it's basically non-intermediary.
[34:04] It's you use Dash network to do transactions with others. It's just other way to use Dash network.
[34:17] It's just that the, the credits, the cryptocurrency is yours and, and you take responsibility that you will serve the customer when they will come back.
[34:35] So you need, you need a business for that. Otherwise, otherwise nobody will trust you.
[34:41] Okay. So what I'm hearing is that this is not about Dash payments yet, but it is not about Dash
[34:53] payments. It is about saying that Jan, you think that the Dash network with platform running can
[35:00] offer at least to small and medium sized businesses, a better gift card as a service option than anyone else in the world, like any and all existing businesses that we can do it better
[35:14] than they can. I think what you can say it.
[35:19] So it's really hard to, to tell what is the best way to market this or promote this. That's why I have decided to go through this procedure because now we are talking about
[35:32] what it is in a descriptive way. And that's, that's already like marketing of your, we are talking about how good it
[35:39] is, but you, you need to convince, sorry. No I said, I'm sorry.
[35:45] I can't help myself too. I can't, I can't stop from slipping into how market, but please continue.
[35:52] You use, you use Dash network for payments between merchants and customers. That's the main thing here.
[36:01] It, it, it hasn't worked yet. We, we were talking about this, you know, chicken egg problem.
[36:08] I don't, I don't like this thing because it's, it's kind of like finding excuses that we do not understand the reason for, for why customers and merchants cannot interact in
[36:24] cryptocurrencies. But here we have solution where merchants can start utilizing this network and they
[36:34] would have incentive to do so because they will, yeah, you can look for any list of benefits of you introducing gift cards or loyalty programs.
[36:47] You will acquire new customers. You can retain the customers you, they pay in advance.
[36:52] You can have sort of, you can provide them some, some benefits, they, you will have increased traffic that can be used as a gift, gift, gift giving solution.
[37:06] So there's a lot of incentives for merchants, why they would like to do this. They have credit afterwards.
[37:13] If the merchants, if the customers cannot, won't come back and spend their credits, it stays with the, with the merchant.
[37:21] So it's good, it's good for, for them. So they have, they have this incentive, they get it more or less for free and, and they
[37:33] might promote it to the, to the customers, which are general public. And then you have plenty of, I have seen numbers from 2022, that's probably outdated, but then
[37:46] it was about 10% of population at least in, in, in Europe and Americas have invested somehow in cryptocurrencies.
[38:00] And that's pure speculation, but you have 10%, at least 10% of population, some kind of experience with cryptocurrency.
[38:10] So I mean, they will not be, there are some, and they might be willing to, to take this. Yeah.
[38:19] I think that the, I think that the value proposition from the merchant side is, is very good. I just actually, Unchained is a podcast that's very popular, and I just saw on their feed
[38:33] a few days ago, they're, one of their most recent episodes says, "Crypto point systems are a 100X opportunity, but founders be wary."
[38:42] And I listened to about half of it, I haven't finished it. But I agree with that.
[38:48] Like the point systems and the, and the loyalty credit systems is an emergence, an emergent crypto application right now, if anybody isn't kind of aware of the broader scene, the broader
[39:02] crypto scene right now, a lot of, a lot of projects are doing exactly this. They're, they're issuing tokens, but not like tokens and, and ICOs were a thing of the past,
[39:16] but, but now they're, people are like a lot of projects are focusing on merchant credit systems, just like we're talking about.
[39:23] So it is kind of a concept that does have, that is in, that is popular right now. So I just wanted to mention that.
[39:30] But from my experience also on the customer side how many times have I purchased a gift card for a hundred dollars, say, and then used 60 of it or something, and then just
[39:44] lost the $40, forgot about using the other $40. That's basically like from the, from the merchant side, they got the money and then they didn't
[39:55] have to provide the goods. So that's why I say this is for everybody that forgets about their gift cards.
[40:01] That's that's a positive thing for the merchant from the consumer though, this, this functions a lot of in, in a lot of the same way as a stable coin would, like if the price of Dash
[40:12] goes up, for example, and I have some local stores that I know I always go to. I might, I would really like to just be able to purchase some of their credits instead
[40:25] of a stable coin and use that for, you know, that's, that's, that's my stable coin because I'm not interested in money only to the degree that I actually can buy stuff with it.
[40:39] So anyway. But they're not accepting Dash.
[40:41] So how would you be able to do that? I mean, you say, if Dash goes up, I want to go purchase their credits, but they don't
[40:47] take Dash. No, I know that's what I'm saying.
[40:51] This, this is, this would facilitate that I'm assuming that this whole, yeah. So I think the question that, you know, I want to answer community questions as much
[41:01] as possible here. Can you put that other one back up on the screen?
[41:06] Would you not run into the same issue that Ethereum has with its layer two, where everyone will just want to want the base layer because that will capture all the value?
[41:18] I don't know. Do you want to answer that?
[41:21] I don't understand what, how, how the, the base layer would capture the, the, all the value.
[41:31] I don't, I don't understand the question. Maybe it was more in the context of the, the discussion going on in the group.
[41:38] So maybe, maybe we can move on from that. The next question that TL had was why use merchant credits and not just use Dash?
[41:46] That's a good question. Yeah, that's a good question.
[41:50] The problem with Dash is that it's extremely volatile and the businesses are doing accounting and have all their cashiers set to a specific local currency.
[42:03] They need to pay taxes and you know, the, they are in business. They do not want to take any extra overhead with following fluctuations of, of Dash.
[42:15] So to be clear, we're talking about Dash as a gift card system, not Dash as a money, which by the way, I'm saying as a good thing, is that, is that what we're talking about?
[42:26] We're talking about Dash as a gift card system, which would meet the regression theorem, right? Because when people say, okay, all monies start out as something else, they start out
[42:37] as something that's useful for something else. So you know, you can't just show up on the scene and be like, yo, we're digital cash
[42:44] bitches. That's, that's all we do.
[42:46] Cash. It's like, no, what was your purpose before cash?
[42:49] So you're saying that Dash's purpose prior to meeting any kind of cash function is as a merchant credit system.
[42:58] Is that right? Yes, you can say so.
[43:01] And the value of Dash network here is that it allows people to transact, which is basically, you know, this is one that's very important part of the mechanism for money.
[43:18] Like you have to, money has to be able to flow. You have to be able to exchange it, pay with it.
[43:26] The only different, Dash has great tech, perhaps the best for payments. It's you know, it's secure, it's decentralized to a pretty good level in my opinion, at least
[43:39] compared with, with other projects out there. It's a, it's a really cool thing, Dash network.
[43:45] We just maybe do not need to impose right away on people to accept that Dash units are, are their money because they are not, they are pure speculation at the moment.
[43:57] But once, once it will be used, the, the useful part of, of, of Dash technology, which is there right now, which Quantum Explorer, you know, and all his team are developing and,
[44:12] and know how cool tech it is. So you just put it in, in the usage for day-to-day purchases of, of, of people whether it will
[44:27] work or not. That's a, that's a, that's a different question, but it's a way to try in my opinion.
[44:34] If, if the use usability of the system is good, the concept is kind of solid, at least as far as we have covered it a year and we can go into details, but it's a, it's quite
[44:49] natural flow, I would say. And if it works, if, if we will, if we will convince enough merchants and enough customers
[44:57] will start using it, then of course the, there is a real, real world connection between Dash network, real world usage for Dash network and, and also a Dash unit, which is Dash or
[45:14] DAFs. And more people will use it then, then basically the DAFs and the, the Dash units, they become
[45:22] shares of, of Dash network. More people will use it, more people will want to keep Dash or need Dash.
[45:31] And Dash would be like a share or something like share for Dash network. And more, more people will use it, more people will value it, bigger value it will have.
[45:46] And also, I guess, like, if we would, if we would go really, you know, parabolic, then, then the, the fluctuation of Dash would get lower, I guess, because the speculation would
[45:59] be, would be harder to, to carry out. So I want to give you some first feedback.
[46:09] So as, as I was listening to you describe this system, I started to think, okay, so this sounds like, okay, another one of those where someone comes up with a, Hey, I've envisioned
[46:22] a great application for our network. And I was reminded of the, all of the pitches we heard about how perfect blockchains were
[46:31] for gamers, right? In the past, because gamers have all these in-game tokens and they have, you know, all
[46:39] these things that they're always exchanging within their game. And blockchain would be so perfect to make it, to make their games finally auditable
[46:49] and to make their in-game assets finally transferable from like one game provider to another. And Oh, we're going to rock these gamers worlds.
[46:57] And obviously that has not happened, did not happen. And so at first I was thinking, Oh shoot, is this just another one of those where we
[47:06] imagine we have the perfect use case. And it just turns out that we're completely wrong, but hello, gift cards for crypto is
[47:16] already a thriving industry and has been for years. And they are the, that they're the largest crypto based e-commerce retailer in the world.
[47:29] So you're not talking about something that's like pie in the sky. You're talking about something that is in some way already like proven to be a huge
[47:39] application that works today. Look, I think, I think it's, it's a common sense application.
[47:50] This one, I don't know about whether it will be failure or not. We are discussing it here as a discussion on the concept.
[47:58] I just, I just feel it could work conceptually. It makes sense to me.
[48:04] I would, I am willing to, to try to, to make it and we will see, we will see how, how the community reacts to it.
[48:16] It would be really nice if, if people criticize it and, and say why it not work. I mean, exactly for what reasons it should not work or cannot work.
[48:28] But yeah, I am an analytical person, a person with a PhD in tech, in computer science. So I don't really know how this will turn out in, in, in reality, in a business.
[48:47] You will definitely need some business development for this. You need, you know, the first step of the procedure is you need to convince the merchants.
[48:58] That's a, that's a lot of, that's a lot of work I think. But on the tech, on the tech, on the technical side of the, of the story, I think it's doable
[49:11] and it should work. Dash network is proven.
[49:16] We're going to do it. I don't think there's any question about like, why would we not do this?
[49:21] We have been, we've been building Dash platform for almost a decade. It seems like probably closer to seven or eight years.
[49:29] This is exactly what I know that you said that we don't necessarily need Dash platform for every part of this, but maybe it's good.
[49:39] Maybe it's good. And maybe it's even better.
[49:41] Maybe we should do that. I think we should do that.
[49:45] Like the conceptually, yes. So I'm just saying if for no other reason, like we need to try Dash platform in the market
[49:53] and this seems like the perfect application because we already know, like Amanda was saying, gift cards from a consumer standpoint is already proven in the market.
[50:02] We already know that there's a big market for people wanting to buy gift cards with crypto.
[50:07] Yes. With crypto.
[50:09] We also know that point systems and credit loyalty systems and gift cards are a, that's a market that's been around for decades.
[50:19] Just think about your airline loyalty point system. Like that's probably the most popular loyalty programs that there are.
[50:27] And they do those for a reason. Like the podcast that I was listening to, she was from the traditional point system
[50:36] loyalty system space. And she was talking about like why companies like to do these point systems.
[50:45] So I know that there's a good market for that. We're just trying to marry those two and say, you know, if you like peanut butter and
[50:52] you like jam, maybe you'll like a peanut butter and jam sandwich. And we've got all the Tixins for it already.
[51:01] We've got the bread even with Dash platform. So let's do it.
[51:05] Let's make it. Yeah.
[51:07] And we'll just see where the market goes. So we'll blame Joel at the, you know, the growth Dash growth if it doesn't work.
[51:20] Because he will be the reason for the failure of the first point in the procedure to convince the merchant.
[51:28] Exactly. That's how it works, Joel.
[51:31] On the merchant side. So from my perspective, if I am somebody that, you know, I earned my crypto, I earned my
[51:39] income as crypto. And so I'm always looking for ways to spend crypto.
[51:42] And I have some local merchants that I like, and I approach them and I say, hey, I would like to give you my loyalty.
[51:51] I would like to spend more at your outfit. There's two routes that we can go.
[51:57] I can either set you up with something like an AnyPay merchant acceptance tool. And you can accept my Dash if and when I come to your store, and I'll come more often if
[52:10] you accept Dash. But then from their perspective, they also are going to most likely want to convert that
[52:18] Dash to dollars immediately. And so they would have to then install something like, I don't know, because I don't AnyPay,
[52:29] I don't think does that connection to their bank account directly. They're just a crypto acceptance tool.
[52:35] So they would have to have an additional tool to convert that crypto that they've accepted to US dollars, and then maybe even another additional tool to convert those dollars into
[52:48] their bank account. Or they can use something like this, where they're issuing, let's say, at the most simple
[52:58] level, they're issuing these gift cards for dollars, even, or whatever. They are basically using Dash network for what is it meant to be used for payments.
[53:13] We just allow them to do the payments in whatever currency or type of money they want. If they want to issue the currency and call that apples, it can be in apples.
[53:33] It does not really have to be national currency. And nobody is preventing them from using Dash directly.
[53:45] And of course, they will always need Dash. That's for sure.
[53:49] So you will not convince them of using Dash. You will convince them of using their own self-issued, self-branded gift cards or merchant
[54:04] money. But then when you will convince them, well, they will need Dash or at least a little bit
[54:13] of it. But that will already get them on our side, on the Dash side.
[54:22] Because the conversion between any of these merchant credits and Dash is the most straightforward one.
[54:31] So as soon as we have two or three merchants anywhere around the globe accepting this one or running this one, of course, we are going to make an exchange or something on evolution.
[54:47] That's a great application and great further development of this concept where people can exchange these gift cards with each other and, you know, buying them for Dash or something
[54:59] else. Okay.
[55:01] So walk me through this potential nightmare scenario. So let's say we at the Incubator write the code that makes this program possible.
[55:14] And we have this software done, but people who are either better funded than we are or smarter than we are or have smarter friends than we do could market it much better than
[55:31] we do. And they take it and run with it.
[55:34] Can this be done on any other network other than Dash? Can they plug and play it into their systems?
[55:39] Or does this require Dash platform specifically so we better get it right? Conceptually, you can do this on any decent layer.
[55:53] Well, you will probably need at least some contracts, like right now platform is not going to have smart contracts right away.
[56:06] It will have these documents. But basically you can do it on any Ethereum-like network, I think.
[56:15] I don't think you even need a smart contract for this, in my opinion. Because I think...
[56:22] You need the code running somewhere. Yes, but then you won't have it decentralized.
[56:27] I mean, you can do it centralized, of course. I mean, you don't need...
[56:32] There are gift cards out there. But if you want to have this permissionless and you want to have it sort of on a decentralized
[56:41] network, I think you will need to have some contracts. You need to store data.
[56:46] You need to store the thing about the currency in which it is issued. You want to name it.
[56:56] You want to have some logo about it. And you will also need to keep something about your issuing private keys and public keys
[57:08] or addresses. You will need to keep this in the business logic of the service.
[57:16] So you need some contracts. I don't think you can do it on Bitcoin.
[57:22] Or actually, you can program Bitcoin as well with some restrictions, like you can have some conditions there.
[57:30] Anyway, I haven't dived too deep into this, but I am convinced that Dash is the best network for payments.
[57:46] So maybe it can be done on other networks. I'm sure it is, but Dash is the best for payments.
[57:57] Yeah. And I think that as part of the research in the marketing side, it might be helpful to
[58:06] see if there are any self-service loyalty program applications out there, like a gift card system.
[58:19] Or maybe there's some open source software that I can just plug in. In general, you will always end up running into the same issues as with the general cryptocurrency
[58:29] for payments. For this, you will need to be able to process a lot of transactions.
[58:37] You want to have them settled as soon as possible. It has to be fast.
[58:41] So these are practical constraints or requirements on the technology. Just to be able to run it.
[58:50] So conceptually, you can put it on Dogecoin if you want, I guess, but I think practically it will fail.
[58:58] And I hope or I think that Dash could make this practically usable. On that note, I mean, the practical, the usability is very important.
[59:12] I think here, before you go and try to convince any merchant, you make sure that the app you're asking them to install is easy to use, that they install it and perhaps the initial setup
[59:27] of the private key is somehow even automatic. And only as soon as they try to issue it, they will force you to store it in a safe
[59:37] place and all that. But I mean, that's the business part of it.
[59:45] It is important already in the product before you go on the streets. Yeah, I think that it's critical to get the UX very, very good, the user experience very,
[59:56] very good for both the merchant and the customer to use this. And if you can nail that, then I see a big market for it.
[60:06] It should be very simple. And hey, it's again, there's a good, I think, history, also a reality.
[60:14] Joel says that the mobile wallet for Dash is like from practical usage point of view, the best one he knows.
[60:25] So we could learn from them, we could have a lot of input from Joel or other people who are using cryptocurrency.
[60:38] You can ask people around us whether they would use it, because then you basically, people won't realize that they are using cryptocurrency with this.
[60:50] For them, it's another app they install on their mobile phone and they use it at their hot dog stand down the street or in their restaurant around the corner.
[61:03] And nobody is exposed directly to Dash, but they will figure it out later on that it actually runs on Dash network, that the fees for these transactions are covered in Dash units, and
[61:18] that Dash units are worth something. Is there anything that we missed that you wanted to say about this particular project?
[61:33] I would say if anybody is interested in helping build this, please contact us. And what else did we miss, Jan?
[61:48] Well, I just want to wish everyone having a happy new year and good luck for Dash network for the near and long future.
[62:01] That's what I would add to this at this moment. And I'm looking forward to try my best, analyze and make this project, and we will see how
[62:14] it resonates with the community and perhaps bring it to the real world, to real usage. That would be fantastic.
[62:22] Excellent. Well, thank you, Santa Claus.
[62:26] We look forward to giving updates about this effort in the future. Thanks for joining us today, everybody.
[62:33] Okay. Bye-bye.
[62:35] Maybe I should have the outro ready, and here we go.
