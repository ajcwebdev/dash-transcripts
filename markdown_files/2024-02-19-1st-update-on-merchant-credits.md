Jan presents a technical demo of Purchase Credits, a decentralized payment infrastructure built on Dash.

tl;dr: Jan demonstrates a proof-of-concept application called CreditPal that enables merchants to issue digital credits to customers in exchange for fiat currency. These credits are stored on the Dash blockchain and can be redeemed for goods and services from the issuing merchant, similar to gift cards but with additional benefits like change back and no double-spending. The system allows for decentralized, peer-to-peer payments without needing centralized payment processors.

00:00 - Introduction and Overview of Purchase Credits
Jan introduces the concept of Purchase Credits (formerly called Merchant Credits) and explains how it differs from traditional gift cards, acting as a decentralized payment infrastructure.

03:02 - Discussion on the Unethical Nature of the Current Financial System 
The hosts discuss the problems with the current dollar system, including lack of competition and unethical practices by central authorities. They explore the potential for cryptocurrencies like Dash to provide an alternative.

06:11 - Technical Demo of the CreditPal Application
Jan walks through a technical demonstration of the CreditPal application, showing how a merchant can issue digital credits to a customer in exchange for fiat currency, and how the customer can later redeem those credits for purchases.

27:24 - Discussion on Extending the Functionality 
The hosts discuss potential extensions to the basic issuance and redemption functionality, including transferring credits to other users and exchanging credits from different merchants.

34:29 - Exploring Potential Use Cases
The hosts brainstorm potential applications of this technology, such as proving agreement on deposit amounts between a depository and customer.

40:11 - Roadmap and Next Steps  
Jan discusses the development roadmap, including plans to utilize Dash Platform for metadata storage and the need for further research into platform capabilities. The hosts also touch on Jan's background in geo-informatics.

[00:00] Recently, DASH Incubator Lead Strategist Ryan Gull was a guest on DAO Watch Fireside with Cryptosi. Near the end of the chat, Cryptosi asked a pretty poignant question.
[00:12] Yeah. What kind of things do you think other DAOs could learn from what's happened with DASH? What sorts of things would you say are, I guess, good practices that DASH has done
[00:23] or bad practices that other DAOs should avoid? Hmm. I really don't know how to answer that question because I feel like I'm still learning
[00:32] so much myself. One of the communities that Ryan then went on to mention was not in the cryptosphere,
[00:37] but the dollar system. In Ryan's words, The dollar system has actually done a lot of things right. They've got a lot of things
[00:43] figured out. The Federal Reserve has got a lot of things figured out. But the problem with those systems is that they're unethical.
[00:53] Unethical. Not conforming to a high moral standard. Morally wrong. Not ethical. What Ryan said is that the dollar system is unethical. Why?
[01:01] They don't allow competition for other people to do what they're doing, which is successful. They don't allow other people to do those successful things.
[01:12] They don't allow competition. This brings to mind Bernard Van Notthuis, a surfer and mint master at the Royal Hawaiian Mint, who in 1998 launched the American Liberty Dollar,
[01:22] a private voluntary barter currency. The Liberty Dollar came in rounds and imprinted certificates and was backed by silver and gold. Van Notthuis never put forth that his items were created
[01:32] by the US Mint or were Federal Reserve notes. Still, US political actors saw the Liberty Dollar as competition.
[01:39] So in 2007, some folks with badges stole $7 million worth of Van Notthuis' inventory, and in 2009, some other folks targeted him in legal land. A Wall Street Journal article
[01:48] recounts how his prosecutor, Ann Tompkins, made the hyperbolic claim that Van Notthuis' efforts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country are simply a unique form of
[01:58] domestic terrorism that "represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of this country." Seriously?
[02:06] Faced with the force of the US regime, Van Notthuis shut down his operation. Today he's back, at least somewhat. He's now promoting the new Liberty Dollar, issued by the Liberty
[02:15] Dollar Financial Association, which, due to the hoops and fine print, doesn't seem poised to gain mass adoption. Alas.
[02:21] And backers of the US dollar system don't only flex against competition within its claimed political boundaries. Consider Muammar Gaddafi, former head of Libya. For decades, Gaddafi
[02:31] had been vilified by Western governments and media. Why? Because he was not inclined to bend the knee, and he questioned the historic and ongoing colonialism in Africa. He was
[02:40] one of the first to oppose apartheid in South Africa, forever earning lifelong friendship with Nelson Mandela. But it was his call for greater Pan-Africanism, he revitalized the
[02:48] idea of an African Union and called a summit in his hometown of Sirte, and for a gold-backed currency that attracted the ire of those who backed the Eurodollar system.
[02:57] A quick side story, once upon a time Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, when journalist Jason Leopold learned that she had been using a private email server to conduct official
[03:05] business he submitted a FOIA request. A judge sided with Leopold and, despite emails being deleted by Clinton and her comrades, there still remained much that showed her character
[03:14] and her motivations, such as this email sent from longtime friend Sidney Blumenthal who had been senior advisor to Bill Clinton when he was president. The email put forth that
[03:22] French President Nicolas Sarkozy was intent to attack Libya to control resources and to stop Gaddafi from implementing a gold-backed Pan-African currency, thereby lessening French
[03:32] clout in the area. Under the guise of protecting Libyan residents, Clinton convinced then-President Barack Obama to get involved. The U.S. military, alongside their comrades in NATO, then proceeded
[03:42] to bomb civilian infrastructure in an effort to effect a regime change. They also funded and armed Gaddafi's rivals. This is all well documented. Check out how Clinton reacted
[03:50] upon learning that Gaddafi had been slain. We came, we saw, he died.
[03:57] The intervention of the United States military and their comrades ultimately led to a civil war. Even Obama later acknowledged this shenanigan as the worst mistake in his presidency. But
[04:05] their goal of stopping someone critical to the U.S. regime and potential competition to U.S. dollar hegemony was successful. It was as if it was out of a playbook or something.
[04:14] And indeed, looking back, it is exactly how the CIA has operated, their modus operandi to enact regime change by funding adversaries and spreading disinformation. But back to
[04:23] Ryan's point, that minus the unethical aspect, Daesh could learn some things from the U.S. dollar system. So how do we go about that? Do we ask permission to operate? To compete?
[04:33] Do we hope the biggest bully in the schoolyard will chill out and let us play? Do we wait for the U.S. dollar system to collapse? After all, we're seeing the global dominance of
[04:41] the U.S. dollar slip, what's called de-dollarization. Maybe we should just bide our time? Or do we take what we can learn from the U.S. dollar system and from any other network, build Daesh
[04:49] into a superior means of exchange and out-compete them? It's not an easy task, but for those of us who prefer not to empower the unethical and to make the world better, today, it's
[04:58] among the most important. I choose option three. How about y'all?
[05:07] Hmm. I'm not sure which one that was. What was that one? It was the final one. The not waiting for chaos.
[05:15] Yeah. Proactively. Not begging for permission from the least likely people to give it, but just building
[05:25] what we can and distributing it where we can, and yeah. How's it going today, fellas? Great.
[05:32] Great. All right.
[05:34] Great. Hello.
[05:36] Hi, Jan. You all may remember that Jan first visited us about two months ago, and that was when his project, then dubbed Merchant Credits, whoa, did I just make myself? No.
[05:50] Sorry. We're working with a little bit different setup. But first, it dubbed Merchant Credits was first announced, and Jan has been hard at work since then, and he is here
[05:59] today to share with us what he has done. So before we send it on over to our friend, Jan, do you have any comments you'd like to make about this project, Ryan?
[06:11] Nope. I think we should probably jump right in to Jan's presentation. I might have some things to say afterwards.
[06:17] All right. Let's do it. Can I bring up the screen at this point? No. Actually, what you said, it was first named Merchant Credits, and we had it as a
[06:30] working name, Merchant Credits. And while working on it during the last two months, there were some maybe things that needs to be clarified. And basically, I would like
[06:42] to talk again about what it is. What is it, this project? What is it about? Is it gift cards? Is it payment infrastructure? Or is it a stable coin? Is it digital cash? Or what
[06:58] is it? So we can start with the name, the Merchant Credits. When we did, or actually you, Amanda,
[07:07] did some research about how it relates to gift cards, for instance. When I was looking up Merchant Credits, the term is actually used already, and that refers to the mechanism
[07:23] when merchants are providing credit to the customer, which is basically exact opposite than what's happening in gift cards, and also what's happening in this payment mechanism.
[07:37] So I refer to it right now as the Purchase Credits instead of Merchant Credits, but it can be named as well Payment Credits. I'm open for suggestions. You have mentioned that
[07:52] maybe you have some suggestions yourself, but anyone from the community, if they feel strongly about how these tokens or credits or units should be called, I would be glad
[08:10] to hear from them. And regarding the application that is used for management of these credits, I refer to it as CreditPal right now. I also use the name CreditPay. So again, I do not
[08:28] insist on any of these names, but I think for sake of clarity, I am using Purchase Credits and CreditPal for the application.
[08:38] The other thing... It sounds like what's remaining is the word credit, and that seems like a mysterious word
[08:46] for a lot of people. What is credit? And you've dropped down merchant, but what is it about credit that you think this project facilitates?
[08:58] Well, I think that credit is a common name for a unit that you might use in financial transactions. So you might say that you have credits. Of course, it can be tokens as well
[09:15] or units. That's perfectly fine with me. But regarding that, there is crediting going on in this mechanism. And that's exactly what I would like to clarify as well, because the
[09:31] merchant is a debtor and an issuer in this mechanism, and the customer is actually the creditor. The customer provides credit to the merchant, and the merchant issues these
[09:46] credits for sake of management of the credit. So the credit that merchant has with any potential customer is managed by this CreditPal application
[10:03] along with Dash Network. And the credit gets repaid by the customer's purchase of the merchant's goods or services. That's how it gets equalized, how it gets refunded. And that's pretty much
[10:21] like what's going on in gift cards. But as Amanda did the extensive research on gift cards, gift cards are quite different from what we are working on in this project, because
[10:34] gift cards are not really like first class digital citizens. It's at the end a plain text, a string that gets exchanged. So as soon as it goes through several levels of
[10:48] exchange, which is exactly what's going on, as she has found out, there is a problem with double spending. You might buy a gift card that basically has been claimed already. And
[11:05] that's a big problem for this gift card narrative and industry as it is standing right now. Also, the gift cards are contractual. So for you, if you want to use gift cards, you'll
[11:22] sign a contract with the issuer of the gift cards. Gift cards also are not exactly convenient as a means of exchange, because you don't get any change. You have to supplement it
[11:37] with your cash or with some other means of payment. There's also no unified user experience for gift cards. You get different user experience from different issuers. And so overall, to
[11:55] run a gift card program, it's kind of big overhead for or inconvenient overhead for merchants, especially small ones. So these things like there is no double spending issue,
[12:13] you don't need contract, you can actually get change. Those are things that are different in this purchase credit project. The other aspect that we address, which actually is
[12:29] completely different from gift cards. It's like if you look, for instance, on Visa or MasterCard, they are basically having their own self-standing infrastructure for payments
[12:42] with the devices. They have the terminals, they have the cards with the chips, and they are operating this entire infrastructure, which of course is centralized. But in this
[12:55] project, we de facto have a means to have like, you know, decentralized payment physical infrastructure where you can pay on the spot in the physical shops with your mobile phone
[13:13] and you do peer-to-peer transaction digitally. Another aspect that I really like, and that's actually how I came first to this idea is the narrative of stable coins. Because in
[13:29] this project, we actually create stable coins that are issued and are naturally backed by the customers as they demand for the units or for the credits.
[13:46] So when you say that, let me clarify that for a moment, Jan. When you say we're in effect issuing stable coins, is that to say that when somebody engages in one of these credit
[13:58] transactions, the sort of token on the Dash network that represents their transaction is representing a specific dollar amount, a specific Euro amount? And hence, does it
[14:09] kind of act as like an NFT in a way? Yes. Yes, you have digital representation of what you charge the creditor who is potential
[14:27] customer. You charge them and in exchange for their dollars or Euros, you issue them the credits, which again is back in this game of is it a gift card or is it a credit or
[14:49] is it a token? Basically, it's a unit, it's a digital representation of the dollars or Euros that you give to the issuer, which is the merchant.
[15:04] Yeah, I think at this point, it might make most sense to jump right into the demo, because some people might be wondering what this is about. It seems abstract. And I think if we
[15:16] jump into this mock, then a lot of things will make more sense. Let's do it. Okay, so I have it pulled up, Jan. So just tell me what you'd like me to
[15:28] do. Well, perhaps you're in the middle of the app right now. So can you reload it or go?
[15:36] Give it a go. This is in the middle. Right, you are. I don't. Yes. Here. Okay, yeah. Now? Yes. So that's what you will see if you install the application on your mobile device. We
[16:08] also have APK or Android package for this mockup. So if you install and run it for the first time, you have to choose whether you want to run it as an individual or as business.
[16:24] So if you go for business, if you click on, then you set up either using existing mnemonic, you can click on using existing. Or you can click on new business. And if it's new, you
[16:48] need to fill in some metadata about your business and about the credits that you will be issuing. These metadata are actually those that get stored on platform in the document contract.
[17:12] But you can use either of them. You can basically just click continue right now because it's not connected yet. It's just a mockup. And once you have your business set up, you can
[17:31] issue or receive these purchase credits. And you do that by entering amount. I mean, if you try to press issue right now, it will not. So you entered 30. You have to enter
[17:49] the amount that you want to issue. So let's say any number 12 or 30 and press issue. So I come in, I'm the customer, I'm coming into Amanda's Cookies shop and I'm saying,
[18:01] hey, I want to purchase $30 worth of in-store credit. And I hand over 30 US dollars like green pieces of paper. And then she's going through this flow to issue me the 30 credits.
[18:16] Let's say that I'm like why I would do this. Maybe I've already made my purchase, but I want to show my loyalty to Amanda's Cookies. And I'll come back and use this credit or
[18:28] I want to give it to somebody else. Maybe I'm going ahead of the story here, but I just wanted to paint the picture here. So Amanda's the merchant issuing me in-store credit is
[18:39] how I think of it. Yeah. So until now, nothing has really happened, but in order to really issue the credits,
[18:49] that's what's going on right now. So you get this page, which is a mock-up for a camera with which you could scan a QR code. That's the big gray area there. That's the one that
[19:06] you should point on the QR code of the customer who is willing to buy or fund, more precisely, fund your credits. So at this moment, the merchant will go ahead only after he or she
[19:27] will charge you 30 euros or $30. And once they do it, they show the QR code on their device and by scanning their QR code, you will issue the 30 credits to that customer
[19:50] and you confirm it on this page. So by this confirmation, the customer will get 30 credits in their wallet.
[20:02] Amanda scanned my wallet as I'm the customer, Amanda's the merchant. She scanned my wallet. We can go through that again. Amanda, make another issue as whatever amount.
[20:15] So it's my cookie store and Ryan wants to buy $200 to support his diabetic constitution. I think it's set to euros, but whatever. Okay. But go and issue. You can read in the
[20:33] small square. Now Amanda is scanning my QR code at this point. Right? Exactly. It's written in the small square, but Amanda is scanning the QR code generated by your wallet on your
[20:52] device. Yeah. I installed the same application, but instead of merchant or business, I clicked
[20:59] individual. And then when I wanted to buy the credits, I pressed some buttons and I got a QR code on my phone. And now I handed over the 200 euros and Amanda is now waiting
[21:11] for me to present my QR code, just like I would receive crypto. I present my QR code. She's going to scan it. And that way she sends me this token.
[21:24] Exactly. So you can cancel it also on the top. So you go back. So this is the issuance. And right now, let's say that you, Ryan, come back two hours later or maybe a week later
[21:46] and you are purchasing some cookies for euro 20. So Amanda goes and you tell her that you pay with your credit. So she enters euro 20 and then she presses receive purchase credits.
[22:05] Okay. And now I'm scanning her QR code. Exactly. Now it's you who's scanning with your wallet, this QR code, and then you need
[22:18] to confirm it. We actually can go through the customers experience as well because we just need to go through the setup again.
[22:32] I think. But just so I'm understanding this right. This seems a lot like this merchant is essentially issuing stable coins. The merchant's issuing stable coins to me. I give her 200
[22:46] euros of cash and she gives me 200 euros worth of stable coins. And now when I want to spend that I'm sending those stable coins, those stable merchant credits back to her and she's
[22:59] canceling them at that point. Exactly.
[23:02] I no longer have 200 euros of liabilities to send goods liabilities to this customer. I now have 180 euros of liabilities to this customer.
[23:17] Yes. Yes. That's, that's, that's definitely one way to. So now instead of banks issuing, creating money out of thin air, it's actually merchants
[23:27] issuing money out of thin air backed by their goods. Well, that's, that's the point. Actually, actually the merchants are the issuers, but
[23:42] they are also the debtors. The real creditor here are the customers or the potential customers to be more precise.
[23:51] Right. I credited her because I gave her $200 and she didn't give me anything in return other than exactly that I can present back to her to get goods.
[24:02] Yes, but she has the money. So she has, she has the backing exactly, exactly fitting the value of the, of the credit.
[24:15] Right. So it, yeah, she has. So it's really, so it really depends. That's, that's this piggy Peggy kind of understand
[24:24] the way you want to understand it, but like the concept of it is actually exactly the same as what's going on in gift cards, because when you buy gift card, you actually give,
[24:37] you actually pay for it as well. You are the creditor. The merchant gets the money ahead of time. And, and it's up to you
[24:49] whether you are going to claim it sometime later and, and the merchant, what the merchant does for you is provides this mechanism of accounting for the debt and recognizing the,
[25:04] the gift card in the, in case of gift card and this purchase credits in the, in case of this application.
[25:12] Okay. Well, at least, at least some people might be asking the question at this point. Okay. Let's say this is all built and everything, and there are no technical issues, but what
[25:23] about, what about a merchant that issues a bunch of credits, takes in a bunch of money from customers, issues a bunch of credits to customers. And then the customer comes
[25:35] back three months from then, and then they say, Oh, that problem, that program was decommissioned. We we're now, we're no longer doing that. And they basically just, you know, they, they
[25:47] had the, they got the money, but they're running off without giving anything in return. Yeah. So first of all, I would like to point out that with gift cards, this is even bigger
[26:01] risk for you because it's completely, or it's solely run by, by their infrastructure. So, so if they are, if they say it's over and you lost your, your gift cards and you lost
[26:19] all the value, you, I don't know what, what you would do in that situation. That would be also answered to your question. But what's different here is that there is actually a
[26:33] record about what has been, what has been done through this mechanism because everything is stored on, on the core blockchain of Dash. So the, the, the creditors, the potential
[26:50] customers, they can prove with this app that they have received these credits of a certain value. And what was the, what was the unit in which it was denominated? Of course, the,
[27:08] I don't know how far you can get legally with this, but I haven't studied that. Sure. Okay. Yeah. Maybe we can go back through the individual flow on the, on the application
[27:24] at this point. All right. One moment. I know that you all had hoped that I would be able to just get
[27:32] this to fit to screen and I did have it, but every time I switch windows, it goes back to being too big. So I'm sorry.
[27:40] Let's have Jan answer this question from one time while you're getting back there. Would credits only be redeemable at one specific merchant or would the same credit work elsewhere
[27:51] too? By, by default, by default, it would be, it would be recognized only by the merchant who issued it. That's, that's for certain. But of course there are options for exchanging
[28:08] these, exchanging these credits, make a exchange, some decentralized exchange where people could exchange credits that are, let's say, denominated in euros or in dollars, or perhaps even, perhaps
[28:27] even change between the units. But technically it works so that the issuer is the one who automatically recognizes the, its own credits. It doesn't recognize somebody else's credits.
[28:47] So if you, so, so, so to give any, to give example to one time, if, if you would come to Amanda's shop and you would have in your wallet only credits from some other shop.
[29:02] Okay. And you would try to, uh, to pay with that to Amanda, her, her app would not recognize it. It was just, it just would not, it just would not go through. Right. Okay. All right.
[29:18] So now I will go in as a business. No, as an individual. Thank you. As a, as individual Ryan. So yeah, this is me. So existing again, like with the merchant, it would be a mnemonic
[29:34] and new, which is, Hey, we'll generate a new empty one. All right. So, um, this is, would be from Ryan's point of view. He's in, he has a new one. He has a new one, so he cannot,
[29:49] he cannot do anything else than fund new purchase credits. Yeah. Yeah. And this is that step where I'm at the counter of Amanda's cookie store and you have to pay the 200 euros or
[30:06] I paid with a credit card or whatever. And then, okay. Now you have the option to see your available credits and spend them. Yep. Okay. So now I have my phone, I'm spending
[30:23] my credits that I already have in my wallet now, and I'm scanning your, Hey, there you go. QR code. What's this fancy lock for? Yeah. It's just so that, so that it does not confirm
[30:37] right away if you are a little bit messy with your fingers. And, uh, so yeah, you have to, you have to like, you have to drag it to the side to, to, to be able to spend, but that's
[30:51] just, that is of course just a UI thing. Yeah. So that was me just purchasing the cookies from the credits that I had. Yeah. And, um, yeah, from now on, it's just a repetition.
[31:10] It's a loop, a endless loop of, uh, of crediting and, um, and purchasing. Yeah. Yeah. So this, this, this feels a lot like any crypto wallet experience where, you know, if I'm sending
[31:26] payments on scanning a QR code, if I'm receiving, I'm presenting my QR code to be scanned. And the only difference here is that, um, I'm sending and receiving in-store credit to a
[31:39] specific merchant, um, where nobody, this isn't fungible money that anybody can use outside of a specific store. Yes. Yeah. That's the basic, that's the basic form of it. So
[31:52] the, uh, technically speaking, the, the basic functions or the basic parts of the protocol is the issuance where, where the, where the application issues, the credit to, uh, to
[32:08] the creditors wallet. And then, and then it is the purchase and that's where the tokens basically return back to the issuer. The, the extension of this concept would be transfer.
[32:24] It means that let's say you want to, that's basically what is a big, uh, feature of gift cards. It means that you can gift it. That's why it's called that way that you can gift
[32:35] it to someone else. You have to give it to your friends or as a, yeah, as a birthday gift or what, what you wish. Uh, and that would basically, uh, mean because the, the,
[32:50] the way it works is that everything goes through the issuer. So, uh, on the protocol level, the transfer would be that you pay back to the issuer and it automatically reissues it
[33:06] to a new address. That's how, how the transfer, uh, would work. And the first, please continue. Oh, okay. I felt that you wanted to ask something. Um, the, the further extension then would
[33:25] be, uh, exchange. That's basically a little bit addresses what one time has asked for. And that would allow that, um, yeah, that would have to be another application because
[33:39] you need, you need some matching signal between people who want, you know, Amanda's credits and who wants, you know, my credits. You need some matching signal, whether there are two
[33:53] people wanting each other's, um, each other's, um, credits. So for that one, uh, there would have to be some more, it basically needs some sort of smart contract, uh, some smart contract
[34:13] functionality so that you can make a exchange, uh, possible, but it's, it's definitely technically possible as well, but it's not in the first version. I've just, um, I'm struck that they're
[34:29] the part of the, or maybe even a main unique value proposition here is that this transaction proves agreement on both sides of the amount. Let me explain the application that has come
[34:48] to mind that makes this like, Oh, okay. Yeah. I can see how that would potentially be quite valuable. So here in Utah, there is an actual bank for among other metal types for gold
[35:07] backs. I think I've shown them here on the show before. There are these pieces of gold and there is a bank, a vault here in Utah that will store gold backs or, you know, pieces
[35:21] of bullion, gold pieces of bullion, silver, what have you. And they act as a bank. They even pay interest, um, on vaulted things held there, at least on gold backs anyway. So anyway,
[35:33] that's like cool and interesting. And I've been looking into it and I started looking into their, uh, you know, security protocols because, um, as Pete smartly asked the other
[35:42] day, he said, yeah, what if their database gets wiped out? I guess in a way, I mean, like, you know, kind of like on, um, fight club, what if things go straight fight club
[35:53] and people don't know the balances that they, that are on deposit anymore. And, uh, so, you know, the goal or the, the, the bank website, they call themselves like UPMA, uh, United
[36:05] Precious Metals Association. They say, well, don't worry about that. We have paper backups. We make regular paper backups. And I'm thinking, okay, that's great. I'll make paper backups
[36:16] too if I become your client, but what if my paper backup doesn't match your paper backup? And so what you're talking about now, um, would provide proof that at the point of deposit,
[36:30] both the bank and the depositor agreed on the amount that's being deposited because otherwise it's just a, he said, she said, isn't it?
[36:39] Yeah. Yeah. You have this kind of bond on blockchain. Yes. It would help if there was some kind of social proof at the beginning of the process where if a merchant starts,
[36:51] uh, starts this process and they want to advertise that there, that you can buy their gift cards by their, by their merchant credits or whatever we're calling it now, um, that they go on
[37:03] their official Twitter handle and say, you know, this is, this is our identity. And yes, we are starting this program. Uh, I'm just thinking of very small merchants that, you
[37:17] know, don't have some kind of notoriety. And if they issue you credits and then even if it is on a blockchain, there wouldn't be any social proof that, that that was the merchant
[37:29] that actually issued that started the program. Does this make sense? Like, um, let's take the Amanda's cookies thing. And again, unless I know from Amanda's cookies, uh, at X.com,
[37:44] um, that it was actually Amanda starting this, then whether or not it's on a blockchain and it doesn't matter because it wasn't actually Amanda that, you know, what we know as Amanda,
[37:57] which is Amanda's Twitter profile, for example, it would need to be like a known private key account. You're saying something like that. I don't know. This is, this is all things
[38:06] that you can just add on as social proof that, that this merchant actually started the program and, and, uh, is issuing these credits. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think there, there should
[38:20] be some kind of legal, like at least reference to some legal framework or a legal agreement that, uh, goes into action when you, when you do this. Otherwise, yeah, it's, it's,
[38:37] it's, it's definitely based on trust alone. If you, if you are starting to issue your, your credits or, or, or whatever. Yeah. And, um, yeah, so that's correct. We're not trying
[38:52] to solve the legal issues necessarily. I was just kind of curious. Uh, that might be a good marketing angle as well anyway, but yeah, the, the, the good, the, of course that's,
[39:03] that's given by the huge flexibility of this because, uh, basically these credits as we call them, but maybe token really is a better, better word, uh, after, after this discussion
[39:15] again, um, the flexibility is big. I mean, you, you can, you can of course refer to U.S. dollars or Euros or Yens, but you can easily make the backing. It can refer, uh, or represent
[39:35] bananas or apples or, or excess, uh, excess attempts or what, what have you. It's, uh, it's up to you. What is the unit that you, that actually those, uh, credits represent.
[39:52] Right. Okay. Um, I think that's a good overview. What, what's the roadmap? Are you developing this? Are you waiting on platform? Are you ready to go? What, what's your timeframe?
[40:11] Um, well, my timeframe is, uh, is that I am implementing this, uh, on my own, um, with help of others. But of course I have to find the help from others by myself, but I implemented,
[40:27] uh, but there are a lot of things that, um, can be reused. I think the, for example, the, the web wallet that, uh, has been done in incubator. That's very interesting for me
[40:42] because you have been dealing with, um, with the memo, uh, memo data. Um, so I would like to reuse that, how to, how to use JavaScript basically to, um, make the payload for the
[41:01] up return, um, part of the transaction. And then, uh, then I need platform. So the first version will be probably on testnet because, um, the, um, the metadata about merchants
[41:22] is stored on, uh, in data contract. So it's necessary for that. Uh, now what I have, what I have kind of figured out even further after our last meeting is that it would be nice
[41:38] to have, um, the amounts and the issuers ID encrypted as well, so that it's completely private and it's not actually seen publicly, uh, which means, which means that the, um,
[41:53] uh, the issuance and, uh, purchase accounting is provable only by the two involved in the transaction. It means by the, by the customer and by the merchant and by nobody else. And
[42:08] so for that, uh, for that, it, um, it might be feasible that the, uh, that some metadata for the individuals, for the customers is stored on, uh, uh, in data contract as well.
[42:28] Um, and then, then there's this option, uh, right, right now, as I'm thinking about it and as, as I want to go further is that these transaction are on the, on the main, on the
[42:46] core chain. Um, but it's, uh, it's a question how efficient that would be if those actual transaction would be on, uh, on the platform as well. Uh, I haven't, I haven't done much.
[43:04] I, I didn't get to that, uh, stage yet. Speaking of other things to get to, did, did we want to go over that flow chart if for
[43:14] only, if for only, um, the reason of just showing it so that people can stop and pause, you may not need to discuss it, or did you want to just, uh, refine that further?
[43:26] We can, we can have a, uh, so what I would like to mention here is the links for these things that we have shown. So people can try it and they can download the APK for the Android
[43:39] app as well. And, uh, then there is a flow chart that kind of, um, clarifies this a little bit hard to imagine flow of the process. So we can show it right now. Um, there are in
[44:00] the flow chart, there are basically two flows. Uh, one is from the, from the merchants or from the issuers perspective. And the other one is from the creditors or from the customers
[44:13] perspective. And, um, that, that basically clarifies what we have been talking about and showing here today, how the process works. And it's, uh, it's, it's quite a high level,
[44:32] uh, of course, but, um, but it's, it's good to, to clarify that if, if, if someone wants to, uh, study the process itself. Yeah. We'll just, we'll just finish doing this little
[44:46] preview here and then maybe you can jump over to the, uh, to the legend so that people can see that real briefly, but I don't, I don't think that we need to necessarily talk about
[44:55] this. I just wanted to show it in case somebody was really interested in the project and maybe even wanted to, to help get involved. Um, and yeah, I guess that's pretty much everything
[45:07] I wanted to cover. Anything else from either of you? No, no, thank you. I think for me, that's, uh, that's all what I have right now. And, uh, I will, I will be working on this.
[45:26] Um, so when I have some better results, I will be back with that. Yeah. Great. As far as I know, we, you know, the, I know that, um, dash platform is in 1.0 dev versioning
[45:40] right now. And I'm hoping to see that on platform that though the 1.0, cause I think right now it's still 0.25 zero. Was it 25 or 15? I can't remember. Um, but anyway, one of the, the,
[45:53] the 0.1s instead of the 1.0. So once that's 1.0, I see no reason to, to wait, um, on at least trying to get some, some kind of, uh, preliminary work done on platform just to
[46:08] see what the process is like, what, what the data modeling is, how you actually upload that to platform. That's what I'm hoping to see this quarter. Okay. That would be, that
[46:20] would be good. I think it's, uh, there's, I have some, I need to learn some more about platform. For instance, it is, uh, to my knowledge or to my understanding, um, the, the, um,
[46:38] the one who establishes the data contract is basically the one who can, who can always change it and can, can always sort of like wipe it out. That's, uh, is that, is that
[46:53] a feature that, that, uh, that is correct or that we'll have some, some other possibilities that that's something I would like to know. But of course, now we are talking about what,
[47:05] what I need to figure out and I will do it. There are both options on platform. There are, there are immutable, um, data contracts and then there are immutable, immutable, immutable,
[47:17] meaning like once you put, once the developer puts that up there, even they can't change it as far as I understand. But then there are, in addition to that, there are ones that
[47:27] you can change, so it should, it should fit your use case. Okay. And then to answer one time's question here, if a merchant has multiple stores and
[47:36] they want the same credits to work at any of their stores, would that be like any crypto wallet where, um, you can have the same private key instance running on multiple devices?
[47:46] Yeah, it will, um, it will be, it will be pretty much as a HD wallet. So yeah, I, I still have to maybe think out some, some, um, edge cases, but I think it should, it
[48:06] should work, uh, the same way as, as if you, um, if you run multiple instances of, of, uh, HD wallet, um, you know, at the, at the same time, because basically for each issuance
[48:22] and for each, uh, for each payment you use new HD address, um, but maybe with the issuance there, there might be some, there might be some problems. Uh, I don't know. Yeah. Like
[48:39] if you, if you have, if you have, I think especially with the issuance, if, uh, if you want to issue simultaneously at the same time from many, from many devices, uh, there will
[48:56] have to be some kind of, there will have to be some kind of, um, checking on that. Some Byzantine work, some Byzantine protection there. One last question, Jan, before we sign
[49:09] off today, I just wondered if you would tell us a bit about what your degree or at least one of your degrees is in, because I had never heard this term before. It's what we just
[49:21] tell us. Yeah. Geo informatics. That's, that's regarding maps and, uh, location and positioning on the earth. So my background really is in spatial databases. It means databases regarding,
[49:38] you know, three dimensions and time. That's, uh, that's my, that's my background. And this is, this is, this is really like, uh, like a fun, uh, fun project for me that, uh, yeah,
[49:55] I like cryptocurrencies and, and, uh, and I like dash. So this is, this is a, you could say it's a, it's a hobby project, but I, I, I would like to try to do it, um, to finish
[50:13] something out of this. Well, the app we've been talking about today would work in space and time. So I see right in there. So, um, yeah, we will see you all next week when we
[50:29] are going to have an update. Is it from Jojo or from Alessandro next week, Ryan? Uh, I believe Alessandro. And what is Alessandro going to tell us about? Uh, he's been doing
[50:40] some work on the, the core dash core, uh, through the incubator. So I just wanted to get some insights on, on what he's, he's up to, um, a little bit more in depth. I, I think
[50:54] we'll wait till next week. Cause he has about three different projects, uh, that he's working on and I'm not sure if we want to cover them all in one episode or split it up, but, uh,
[51:06] yeah, it's some exciting stuff on the dash core side. Okay. Sounds good. All right. Until then. Bye everybody. Bye.
