[00:00] [music] "Fear is the mind killer." It's a phrase you've likely heard before.
[00:09] If you're a metal fan, you'll recognize it as the name of Fear Factory's remix album. But likely the source of this phrase for most is Frank Herbert's epic novel,
[00:17] Dune. The "Fear is the mind killer" line is included in the litany against fear recited by the Bene Gesserit, the secretive sisterhood who possess occult knowledge and supernatural
[00:27] abilities. Herbert may have drawn inspiration from Rumi, the 13th century poet who wrote, "Move outside the tangle of fear-thinking," or from Buddhist, Hindu, Gnostic, or Stoic thinkers.
[00:38] Or he could have reached that conclusion himself. As with any truism, the fact that fear can be debilitating is discoverable by anyone.
[00:45] If one is consumed by fear, it is crippling. They cease any forward movement or evolution. They are not even static. They regress. Rather than being an actor, a factor,
[00:55] they are reduced to being manipulatable prey. However, if, as the litany against fear suggests, one is able to simply take note of their present emotion, whether it be fear or anything else,
[01:07] without judgment and without letting it take root, then they are not controlled by that emotion. To put it another way, if you are able to observe an emotion, then that emotion is not you.
[01:18] This is an understanding that is core to the tenets of non-violent communication, as espoused by the late Marshall Rosenberg, that one can observe one's emotions without being
[01:26] controlled by them. This can then lead to more constructive dialogue, with needs and requests being put forth and common ground established. Indeed, some have gone so far as to say that
[01:36] the space between observation and action is where freedom exists, self-mastery or self-governance. Still, fear is one of the strongest emotions a person can have. It's hardwired to assist with
[01:47] the survival of the organism, but we have advanced beyond our limbic system. We are conscious beings. We possess the ability to reason, and may find solace in higher ideals. Yet, many of us in the
[01:58] cryptosphere, myself at times, have a tendency to focus on what they are doing. Energy is put into staying abreast of the latest witch hunts, the latest absurd claims, the latest power grabs,
[02:09] the what-if scenarios. If this occupies one's thoughts, one may begin to see themselves as oppressed, as a victim, always being targeted by the powers that be, or, based on the resources or
[02:20] inertia at play, impotent to make a difference. This self-doubt is what the powers that be thrive on. Without question, they employ psychological means to subject, to control, and to steer.
[02:32] And fear is always an undercurrent in their manufactured narrative. Others, in discussing programmatic CBDCs, have stated that the ability to control economic activity is the surest way to
[02:43] control a person. If a person can be cut off from their financial resources, preventing them from traveling to see family, or even from buying food, due to speech or actions thought offensive to the
[02:53] powers that be, that person will likely self-censor. But bad actors only have as much power over you as you grant them. It makes sense to stay abreast of possible risks, but we need not fixate on them,
[03:04] and we need not let them poison our mindset and our capacity to live true to ourselves. There's a reason banksters and their ilk are leaning on regulated crypto actors to delist
[03:14] privacy coins while charging full steam ahead with their CBDCs. Because their business model, which for centuries has rested on fear and on division, is under threat of being eclipsed by
[03:24] some scrappy upstarts. Will these bad actors ramp up their misinformation campaign this year? Probably. Will these bad actors issue new decrees against tools like those we're building?
[03:34] Probably. Will these bad actors target some individuals for their involvement in this space? Probably. They will use whatever means they can to try to derail the technologies,
[03:44] ideas, and individuals that threaten their clout. But if we possess the mental fortitude, they cannot deter us. Let's take a step back to appreciate the scope of this crypto endeavor,
[03:53] and just how far we have come. We are working to create a better means of exchange, one that could be voluntarily used by any individual, anywhere in the world. Should we succeed,
[04:02] the impact is huge. We stand on the shoulders of many who have acted to shirk the yoke of tyranny. Freedom of speech, of association, of the press, and of religion, to name but a few.
[04:13] Now, we are poised to unlock the freedom to transact. By offering an uncensorable means of exchange, we are empowering individuals to be true to themselves, thereby unleashing ideas,
[04:24] creativity, and fulfillment, while at the same time peacefully nullifying those who seek to continue their manipulative, fear-based parasitism. Our cause is worthwhile, you are worthwhile,
[04:36] so let's each unshackle any fear that has been holding us back, and let's make this happen for ourselves and for future generations.
[04:42] Good day, everyone. Welcome to Incubator Weekly, which is a quarterly report for us, and I think it's the day after, is it Christmas for you, Mikhail?
[04:59] Yeah, that's right. All right. Thanks for the festivities there. So does anyone have any opening comments before we
[05:09] get into Mikhail's quarterly report? Yeah, I do. Actually, I wanted to comment a little bit on that intro. I love Pete has a great balance of fear and love as motivators,
[05:28] and as the newsreel or the intro suggested, we need to be aware of fear, and it's okay to have some knowledge of what could be happening to us, but it's important also to focus on just building
[05:43] and moving forward despite all those things. That's why I always like to dedicate this first five minutes of every show to focusing on why we build, and why we build is because of some of that
[06:02] fear-based stuff. Like if you are in the forest and you hear some crackling sounds, and it could be a bear, we've developed that fear in order to motivate us to action, but that's really the only
[06:16] thing that it helps us with. If we don't actually take it forward and take that action, then fear just does nothing for us, and it cripples us. The other 55 minutes of all of these shows is
[06:29] dedicated to what we're doing. The first five minutes is why we build, then the next 55 minutes is what we're building, and I think that's a pretty healthy balance. There's a phrase that
[06:43] goes, "If you give a man a why, he can bear almost any how," and I believe that was Nietzsche that said that. It doesn't matter what the context is. I believe in the premise of that, and for me,
[06:56] there's a very, very, very compelling why on why I'm building in this space, why I'm motivated to stay working on this particularly, and it is not easy. Figuring out how to build and what to build
[07:11] is that strategy component, so I'm looking forward to what Mikhail has to say about what his strategy is in the past quarter and in the upcoming quarter, so I think,
[07:24] yes, that's all I wanted to say about that intro. >> Okay. Right on. So, Mikhail, let us begin. >> Yes, thank you, guys. I'm going to share right now slides I have prepared about the work that
[07:44] I have done on the projects, the projects that I'm working on as the strategist, what we've done, and what's next, what's the things that we want to do. So, the first,
[08:04] the major one, the project that we were working on in the last quarter is the Platform Explorer, so what we achieved is that we implemented the basic functionality of the Dash Platform Explorer,
[08:22] so basically, we have everything in there for the basic things. You can view identities, you can search data contracts, documents, you can see the content of the documents,
[08:35] you can check the balance of the identities, you can even check the transactions of each identity, you can check the transfers, the documents that are attached to this identity,
[08:49] I mean, that was submitted by this identity, and also the other work. It also was proven that the backend is pretty robust, so I haven't had any issues in I haven't seen any issues
[09:10] with the indexer, besides one issue that we have found with the platform team, that was like a month ago, that it was like a replay attack bug that I found with my Platform
[09:25] Explorer. So, except that there is some protocol bugs, the indexer works fine, the backend always operates, and everything works pretty nicely. So, here's some screenshots of what we built.
[09:44] So, basically, we have some kind of frontend where you can check the transactions, you can search things, you can see blocks, data contracts, identities.
[10:01] It has such a nice stat, when you check over the given identity, where you can check the transactions, transfer documents, data contracts.
[10:12] So, the most good thing that the basic things are there, and developers can use the Platform Explorer API to build some things without deploying their own node, without hosting
[10:31] their own infrastructure, which is pretty good. Not just pretty good, but that's pretty necessary. Exactly. We need to know what's going on behind the scenes there, so I'm...
[10:47] Of course. It's also very important, you can always check what's up with the network, because you can check just if the blocks is operating, if the blocks is producing,
[11:01] you can always check and compare, like if there is any issues, you can literally check on the Platform Explorer if the network is up. So, it's very useful.
[11:12] And did you get the uptime? I think we talked about it last time, when you reported on this project. Does it show how long Platform has been up and stable?
[11:22] Not yet, but I already prepared the free infrastructure that I'm going to show up soon. There is a Grafana dashboard, which is built on the Prometheus, if you know about that.
[11:39] So, basically, I'm going to prepare some dashboards that will show the uptime for which projects that I'm hosting. This is the Dash Electrum, the Platform Explorer,
[11:51] what else? Anypay, everything, what I maintenance, everything will have some dashboards that everyone can just check how it's going. For example, there are some issues from
[12:08] some people about Dash Electrum servers, some reports that it's not working, but it's actually working. There could be some other issues, but you will certainly can check
[12:19] how it's going. So, I'm going to show up these things very soon. So, yeah, kind of like that. I want to move to the Dash Electrum, which is the project that I'm
[12:35] working on past month, I think, like last two, three weeks. I'm just really deep into this project. So, basically, what I was able to complete is, first, I deployed the server infrastructure
[12:55] of the Dash Electrum, which allowed us to use the Dash Electrum wallet again, because there wasn't any up-to-date servers out there. So, I deployed my own server,
[13:16] which is at mydomain.pshedmic.dev. Secondly, also updated both the server side to the Dash Core v12 and also the client side.
[13:33] So, it requires both sides, because usually, if you don't operate with the masternode payouts, the changes weren't so important, if you don't deal with the masternode payouts. But if you do
[13:50] receive masternode payouts on your Dash Electrum, it includes the Coinbase TXV3 transaction, and Dash Electrum was failing. So, I just backported the changes from the
[14:07] Dash Electrum repository that we previously updated and updated the client side as well. The third important thing that I have completed is, I revised and upgraded all of the dependencies
[14:24] of the project. So, the project was pretty outdated and was using Python 3.6, which is, like, I don't know, but it was out of date, really, a long time ago.
[14:40] And I have done some work on upgrading all of these dependencies to meet the recent Python versions that are supported and that are bundled with the recent Ubuntu
[14:54] and other operating system distributions. So, it allowed me to successfully run the project locally and use debugger to debug the code. And the most wanted feature by the community is the
[15:12] private send and CoinJoin, that I'm working on really hardly right now. And I already have achieved some important goals. So, first, it was out of date and it was based on Dash Electrum
[15:33] v15, the P2P protocols. So, it was stuck on the block, I believe it's v18 hard fork, when v18 hard fork happened. So, the height of private send LLMQ quorums in the Electrum wallet was stuck.
[15:55] So, what I did, I upgraded all the P2P protocols, all of this message structures. So, it continued to sync with the LLMQ quorums that allowed us to CoinJoin, to mix your coins.
[16:15] So, after that, I resolved some other issues, some other errors. And for now, I have already have some successful CoinJoin rounds. You can see by this screenshot, there is a blue and green
[16:33] lines. So, that is doing good. It's not yet fully working. It's now doing some rounds, but it's not finishing the mixing. I'm resolving some lost errors and my goal right now is to repair private
[16:54] send until the Dash anniversary. That is something that I really want to done because we're on the 10th Dash anniversary, there will be a mixing event. And it will be really great if we have
[17:09] Electrum wallet that allow us to mix your coins without needing to download the whole blockchain. Can we briefly talk? I don't know what you're saying. Are you on January 14th? First of all,
[17:23] is that the 10th anniversary? And secondly, there's a mixing event scheduled? Yeah, I've heard of it. At least in Russian community, I believe in the English community
[17:34] as well. There will be a mixing day. So, everyone is encouraged to withdraw your coins from the centralized exchanges and just do mixing. On January 14th? Yes. So, it's just like a community
[17:55] event that should bring up some more attention to the Dash project and just a cool thing. Yeah, that'll be fun. I hope that that's successful. There wouldn't be anything better
[18:14] than if everybody tried to withdraw their coins from Binance, for example, and Binance had to go out and rush to buy a bunch of Dash to cover those liabilities. Because who knows if they actually
[18:29] have them. Yeah. So, the next thing that I need to do after I fix the private sense is I need to release and test new major Electrum Dash build. The last version was 4.1.7.2.
[18:47] And since there are a lot of dependency upgrades, we need to have a pretty decent test between a decent test on different operating system on different environments, you know.
[19:05] So, the builds are working right now. There are some issues with the Windows builds, but I think I will close those issues very soon. There are some
[19:22] dependency Visual Studio stuff, so I think I will sort it out. Yeah, what I do next is I want to revise some Electrum X server resource limits that I have
[19:36] on my infrastructure. So, basically, there are some limits in the Dash Electrum server software that just blocking some people to use Electrum. Because some people have a lot of addresses,
[19:52] a lot of transactions, and when they sync their wallet with my server, they often just hit resource limits. So, I need to get deep into this algorithm of resource limits and just,
[20:10] you know, bump those limits. I haven't done this yet. Also, instant send transactions are not shown in the wallet. When you send the transactions from the Electrum wallet,
[20:24] yeah, all the transactions are instant send now, but they are not marked in the wallet that they are conferred via instant send. They're just shown up as unconfirmed.
[20:37] So, what I want to do is just make some, you know, information about that everything fine, you can, like, everything fine, and your transaction was confirmed by instant send.
[20:50] Also, another thing that I think would be good to have is to hard code some Electrum X servers certificates into the code to mitigate some attacks where you could use some man-in-the-middle
[21:11] attacks on the new users, which downloads the wallet. So, there were some cases like that in the Bitcoin Electrum wallets, and also, like, Electrum caches the certificates when you first
[21:29] connect to it, but what if you first connect to a fake Electrum X server? So, that would mean that you would cache the invalid, the fake certificate, you know? So, this kind of attack I want to
[21:47] mitigate by hard coding. Mikhail, just briefly, what's the difference between Electrum Dash and Electrum X? Electrum Dash is a client interface. This is just the wallet, the exact wallet.
[22:06] What the user interacts with. Yeah, yeah, and Electrum X server, the server part, yeah, Electrum X server is a software that allows you to just not download
[22:20] the block data. It just sends over the headers, and the Dash Electrum client software just do a simple payment verification. Okay. Yeah, so, what I'm going to tell you next is about AnyPay.
[22:40] So, AnyPay, as you know, is a self-custodian payment processor. So, it just processes payments via API, and you can also have some merchant app application that acts like a
[22:55] terminal. There wasn't so much work in this quarter on this project, but what I've done is I deployed my own AnyPay backend API. So, that basically was needed in case the official
[23:11] AnyPay server, if AnyPay official server was down for a moment, you could just switch to another backend, or even you can deploy your own backend and just switch the backend API URL in the settings
[23:26] of the merchant app. So, yeah, I have deployed my own infrastructure of the backend that allows you to accept payments, and we also prepared the pull requests of adding such functionality to the
[23:46] merchant app. It's still in review though. And so, Mikhail, we have a question. Does this mean AnyPay is working right now? Yeah, as far as I tested last time, it was working.
[23:58] Does that mean that AnyPay Inc infrastructure is working, or does that just mean that you found that your instance of AnyPay is working fine? So, can you comment about on AnyPay, the corporation,
[24:15] if their infrastructure is working? So, their infrastructure is working right now. There were some issues maybe a month ago, so it was down for a moment.
[24:26] Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry about that. So, yeah, there were some issues with the official
[24:41] AnyPay infrastructure for a moment, and I couldn't resolve that because I haven't had access to their infrastructure, so I had to just deploy my own
[24:52] so that some payment could be done without official server, you know. I will also officially support the backend and also will have a monitoring of this backend and
[25:06] metrics, you know, so we can improve. I think this is Joel asking this question here, and I'm guessing he's doing so because he likes to patronize at least one coffee shop that uses
[25:20] AnyPay. And so, perhaps a question would be, if AnyPay Inc's infrastructure goes down or is down, I don't know, is there anything that the merchant needs to do to switch to your server,
[25:34] which is working? Yeah, they should just set my infrastructure API URL in their merchant app, and they can just switch.
[25:45] I wonder if it would be a good feature to have some kind of an automatic switch that says, if AnyPay Inc's backend server is not responding for some time, just switch automatically to your
[26:01] backend that may or may not have any kind of affiliate fee or whatever. I don't even know if AnyPay is taking affiliate fees. Yeah, good question.
[26:08] The merchant shouldn't have to do anything, it should just work. Yeah, the thing here is that AnyPay uses some kind of database to hold
[26:19] your accounts, so when you switch the backend, you have to have the same credentials, you know, you have to re-login because each backend API has its own database, its own storage, you know.
[26:36] Yeah, so just something to think about. Yeah, yeah. I don't want to have you design it right here. I agree, I agree.
[26:47] Okay, so we also had some Dash Core contributions via Vijay, which done really plenty of Bitcoin backports to the Dash Core, which was accepted by Pasta from the Dash Core. So yeah, he's done
[27:09] really pretty much good amount of work. Really, there was like maybe 15 or maybe 12 PRs that was accepted by him. That was something also we were working on.
[27:23] And also, the last project that we brought up again in the incubator is the Local Money. Basically, that was the project that we was working on that was inside the Dash incubator
[27:43] previously, but right now we revised that and we decided to do this in decentralized way. You may heard about the BISC P2P exchange application, so it works kind of like that.
[28:06] So a user, a trader, and a user and trader can just download the application that just runs on their mobile phone that doesn't require any centralized
[28:24] servers, centralized endpoints, and will act strictly in the P2P, in the peer-to-peer way. Can we get a little intro on this, Mikhail? First of all, this is meant for Dash to fiat
[28:46] exchange, right? This is not like if you want to swap Bitcoin and Dash. This is if you want to swap rubles and Dash, yeah? Not exactly. It can support other coins as well. It's not
[29:01] strictly bound to the Dash, so it's just like a software that will be done by the incubator that will have incentive in Dash. It will also have mentions that this project had done by Dash and
[29:18] will also give people a knowledge of Dash. So basically, this is something like BISC, but Where one half of the trade is like fiat, generally, right? Or always, even?
[29:36] Yes, fiat. The most important feature that it would be the KYC-less, so you don't really have to have know your client, you know, those rules. All you have to do is just download the application
[29:53] and then just run some trades that will be done in B2B network. To do that, we plan to use two or three multi-signature trades. So that means that if the buyer and the seller
[30:13] confirms the trade, like if the seller received the coins and the buyer sent the coin, then everything is fine. The money just sends the transaction.
[30:28] And then there's a dispute, what happens. Because I remember, I think BISC had dedicated arbiters or something?
[30:34] Yeah, that's right. So in case someone, buyer or seller, doesn't really want to accept the trade, like to complete the trade, that means that they have only one of three
[30:51] multi-signature. Then we come to the third party that will be selected through the DashDAO. So basically, we will have some proposals that will choose who will be the escrow
[31:08] agent. It will be selected decentralized via DashDAO and then we will pick some people with authority that won't scam people and they will resolve those trades, resolve those
[31:30] issues. They will have the third signature that will allow the trade to go in either way in which the escrow will decide.
[31:41] Wow. Yeah. So the idea is pretty good. This is the project that we want to bring up in 2024.
[31:54] So basically, what was done right now is we have front-end already. We need to work on the back-end. We need to work on the application that will allow us to do all of this stuff,
[32:10] all the signatures, you know, all the stuff. Right now, we only have the front-end. So yeah.
[32:17] And BISC was open source, right? Like, were you able to use anything that they made? No, it will be done from the scratch. So basically, I don't think we can just reuse
[32:37] all of the BISC we have. And also, I didn't really want to do that. So any question about this project?
[32:48] No, I'll probably have a few more things to say about it when I do mine. There is a question here from Splawik. "Mikhail, do you monitor how many users connect to your
[33:00] server with Electrum Dash? Do you have any numbers like MAU?" Yes, I'm going to prepare some monitoring on the Dash Electrum server as well
[33:15] very soon. So I'm going to show that information too, but not yet. I'd be curious if we have that information on, well, I guess we wouldn't be able to have that
[33:28] on Dash Core because everybody has their own instance and can't really monitor it. But that would be interesting data.
[33:34] And we have one more question. Sorry. Just Dash Core doesn't have Electrum infrastructure anymore. So yeah, only we have. And actually,
[33:45] I found some FreeMouse Electrum X servers, which is run by, what's the project called? So there is some decentralized exchange that is running some Dash Electrum servers that also
[34:04] should distribute the load a little bit. That is output done by a Dash community member called CP, as I remember.
[34:14] And Halaway wanted to confirm that... Yeah, I remember the name. It is Komodo.
[34:24] Okay. And Halaway wants to confirm the local money doesn't need any platform functionality, right? So it can just...
[34:35] It's not sticked yet, but we can use some platform feature later. So this platform is not in my net yet, so I can't really rely on that right now in such project.
[34:51] Okay. So yeah, I also done something on the Ryan's side, on the Ryan's budget. So Ryan runs some...
[35:06] Ryan have concept on the Dash platform contributions. And I also done something on that side. That's something that is not under my budget,
[35:18] but I also done something on the DashMate side. There was some really good things, some important things, which is config migrations allowed us to stabilize DashMate builds when we
[35:32] release new versions. Basically, it checks how the config looks like if we have some misunderstanding between the actual config and what we expect. We also disabled automatic config rewrites,
[35:49] which was unnecessary in many cases. So we just don't rewrite anymore. I've added a core click command that allow you to fire up Dash CLI commands straight into the DashMate. So you don't
[36:10] have to execute some weird commands in the Docker containers, you know. There were some UI fixes, also very important thing that we migrated DashMate to the Node.js ESM syntax. Basically,
[36:28] it comes together with the Node v12 upgrade. So it was pretty important. Platform team was really busy with some other tasks, but at the time it was like September or October,
[36:46] I don't remember exactly. The new Node.js version came out and it was breaking some people notes. Actually, I don't remember that it was breaking, but
[37:05] the previous Node.js version was out of date and we had to just quickly upgrade the platform project. And that's part of it. We migrated Node.js to the new ESM syntax, which is the modern
[37:17] JavaScript syntax. Also, I've added a config write-under command and there was some other bugs and improvements that was reported by the community. I'm constantly checking the Discord,
[37:33] the Dash forum, if there are some important several issues and I'm quickly fixing it. So yeah, kind of like that. That's everything that I wanted to share with you.
[37:48] Okay, great. Thank you for that. And I will probably just jump right into the lists that I had prepared. This is our reward summary for quarter four
[38:06] of 2023. So the past quarter, what we have spent in for both my budget and Mikhail's budget, as well as Ash's and Tim's, and I'll get to that in a minute.
[38:23] So on my side, we spent most of this quarter focusing on the vanilla, well, it's called vanilla. It doesn't need to be. It's just the JavaScript web wallet. So web wallet is what
[38:38] we're doing. And we happen to be building it without using frameworks like React or Solid or Vue or anything like that. We're doing it in vanilla.js. That's why it's called vanilla.
[38:49] I think that it's extremely important that we have an up-to-date and constantly integrating different services, web wallets, not necessarily a desktop wallet,
[39:02] not necessarily a mobile wallet, but a web wallet, a wallet where people can go to the internet, go to a certain URL, and then they have a Dash wallet. Now we do plan to package that as both
[39:17] mobile and desktop wallet. All you have to do is put some of... I won't go ahead and get into the details, but there are wrappers that can make a web application into a mobile wallet
[39:31] and a desktop wallet. So you can use the same code base and have all of the platforms, web, mobile, and desktop covered with one single wallet that has a seamless user experience
[39:45] across all of those different platforms. So that's what we've done there. And we had planned on having an update on where we're at with that next week on Monday. But as I'll talk about later,
[40:00] we pushed that to the following week, and we're going to be talking about a different project next week that I will talk about later. So the next thing that we've spent Dash on is Dash core
[40:12] contributions, or Dash platform contributions rather. This has mostly been work by Mikhail, and I've done a little bit of that, but I plan on doing more of that. But this is mostly stuff that,
[40:25] correct me if I'm wrong, Mikhail, but you've been the primary dev on this project as well. It comes from my budget, but before you were a strategist, and you didn't have much of a budget to work with,
[40:36] so you were doing several projects under my budget. That will be changing in this next quarter, should we get the funding for both of our proposals, which I'll talk about later. But
[40:49] they'll all be transferring some of these to you, and some others that I'll retain. This one I'll probably retain because I plan on doing some more work on this, and then you can continue to work
[40:59] from my budget on that as well. The incubator updates is just this show. We do it weekly, and that's pretty straightforward. Incubator social was, we put some, we categorized the Utah Dash
[41:16] retreat under this, so we didn't, this wasn't everything. There were a lot of donations that covered a lot of the expenses as well, but Incubator did pay for some of the speakers as well
[41:28] on that. Strategy is typical 10 percent that goes for a general budget that each strategist can work with. It's 10 percent of the total proposal amount, so my proposal last quarter was 500 Dash,
[41:47] so 10 percent of 500 Dash is 50 Dash per month. 50 Dash per month times three is 150 Dash. That's where that comes from. You'll also see that here in Mikhail's line item. He was requesting 200 Dash
[42:03] per month last quarter times three is 60. Electrum Dash, Mikhail talked about that. This was under my budget, but he was doing most of the work.
[42:13] Incubator infrastructure, this is just, you know, hosting random websites, purchasing domains, stuff like that. Not a lot going on there, 40 Dash. Like which websites?
[42:31] I'd have to look into the details. I think this was for something that was one of Tim's projects and maybe a couple other things. I'd have to look into the details, but it's all
[42:42] available on the spreadsheet if you go to claims, where I think you can actually double click this, and this is a public web. This is public, so I mean we could look at it right now.
[42:56] We double click this to see if this works. Was it also this last quarter that all y'all transferred the domain dash incubator dot app from Andy to y'all? Yeah, so that's what you see
[43:10] here. So you double click that line item or that item itself, and it shows you where they're coming from. So this was Emmanuel Eclipse. I think that some of this might have had to do with
[43:25] the local money project, but I'm not sure. I'd have to look into the actual claim on that one, but yeah, a part of this was Andy Freer. We paid him for several years of hosting dash incubator
[43:36] dot app website and some domains that he had purchased that transferred it to us. So that's that, and I'll just delete this tab right here because you can always get back to it.
[43:52] So back to here now. Dash economics R&D. This was something that I was working on. I know that it was a controversial project. I didn't spend much money on this. This was
[44:06] mostly just data gathering and doing some research on our economics. 36 dash over the whole quarter. Any pay assistance. Mikhail talked about that, and merchant loyalty credit system was the,
[44:23] this is the 1.2 dash that's just standard. If a concept is accepted, they get one dash for creating the concept, and then there's the strategist commission as well. So that's what
[44:36] that is. That's what we did the past quarter. Again, the vast majority of this was the wallet, the incubator wallet that we will. And Ryan, are you still looking for testers on that? Or how,
[44:48] is there anything people can do to help move that forward? Not yet. I'm the primary tester on that. Probably be, we will be wanting testers for this next quarter for sure.
[45:02] And again, two weeks from now, we will give an update on where we're at with that project. So I don't know if Mikhail wants to say anything about these numbers at all, but he's talked about
[45:18] all of these in his presentation. And here you have the numbers in case you're, you're curious where, where your dash is going. And then I just wanted to briefly show Ash. He's still an active
[45:33] strategist. He's still a strategist, but he's not actively pursuing funds at this time still. So he did still spending from his reserve. Yes, he's still spending from his reserve. And he worked on
[45:47] Maya Protocol and Platform Explorer. This used Platform Explorer used to be his project. I think Mikhail was working on that under, under Ash at the time. And now Mikhail has it as his own project
[46:01] here, Platform Explorer. So you can kind of sum those up and see how much we're, we're spending on, on each of those. And then Tim Spectaprod is his username on Trello.
[46:17] He, there wasn't much going on. So this Goal Challenge Platform, that was one project that he spent some, some fun, some funds on this past quarter.
[46:29] But that's kind of currently on ice until he requests some more funds, which likely won't be this quarter, but potentially next quarter. And then I just also wanted to
[46:41] say the Local Money Project was Tim's project originally, and he was working with a developer on that. And Mikhail did, did accept that one into his budget this quarter. And we'll probably be
[46:56] spending, putting, allocating some funds to that for the following quarter if his proposal is accepted. I wanted to highlight this as kind of one example of where, like how things work in
[47:10] the incubator. Like if you, if you're a developer and you have, you're working on a project, you're typically working under one project manager, strategist that we call, what we call them.
[47:22] This was one particular project that Tim ran out of funds on. So he doesn't have the funds to continue building it. And so what happens then is one of the other strategists has to kind of
[47:35] take that on. And both Ash and I decided to decline on this one on the Local Money Project. It seems like a very big lift to me, both in terms of engineering as well as marketing. So
[47:50] I just didn't see that that fit within my budget and my strategy, but Mikhail did pick it up. And that's kind of, you know, the beauty or the curse, depending on how you look at it,
[48:04] of working in the incubator. It's, if you are a builder, if you're one of the developers and your strategist, your project manager runs out of funds or doesn't feel like that's, that fits
[48:16] with his strategy, then you have alternatives. You can pitch your idea to one of the other strategists. And, you know, apparently that was effective for Mikhail. And I hope that,
[48:27] you know, I hope all these projects are successful, obviously, but it just wasn't a priority for me or Ash. So that's, I just wanted to highlight that as kind of an example of how things work
[48:37] in the incubator. - We had a question come in a moment ago, Ryan, if we could get to that one before you continue, I don't know where the question has gone, but it was something like,
[48:46] you'd previously noted your intention to do lots of platform testing last quarter. How did that unfold? - Yeah. So that is this dash platforms contributions. And I opted personally,
[49:00] I was going to have AJ do some significant testing on this. I didn't find in the end that it was stable enough to justify AJ's cost. So AJ is a, he's an expert. He's a senior engineer.
[49:16] He's very expensive. And with the stability of platform, I did not think that that was a good call to have him work on that this quarter. I am now, I guess I'll jump, that's a good springboard
[49:31] into what I'm planning on doing this coming quarter. I am planning on throwing resources at that exact thing with dash platform contributions. I am personally going to,
[49:43] at least I plan on, going through and working through trying to build a hello world app on dash platform. I'm going to stream the whole thing ready or not. So whether the platform, whether
[49:59] platform is ready, stable, and well-documented, I'm going to find that out through personal experience because I'm not as expensive as, as AJ, for example. And so I want to kind of go
[50:12] through those experiences, see if the document documentation is up to snuff, see if things are working, at least see how well they're performing in terms of like, how long does it take to
[50:26] download the dash SDK? For example, that's one thing that I'm very concerned about. And does it work in certain environments? For example, when I started working on dash platform as a developer,
[50:38] two years ago, and I, I found several issues in my work, I was trying to use the dash SDK in a serverless lambda function on AWS. And I found, like I was running into lots of problems
[50:59] with that. And I spent so much time trying to figure that out. And I thought it was just, you know, me, I was, you know, I'm not, I'm not an expert developer. But this SDK is supposed to
[51:11] cater to average developers. And so I wasn't sure if it was me, or if it was the SDK, or some infrastructure that was the problem. But I just decided I can't, I can't work efficiently on this.
[51:24] And that's been like, kind of the story for several, or a couple years now. But I'm coming, I'm coming back to this ready or not, I think that platform is ready, Mikhail, I've talked a
[51:37] lot. So Mikhail, can you jump in? Can you give us an idea of is platform stable right now? Or is there's like, how much headbanging is there? And I don't mean like rocking out, I mean, like
[51:49] banging your head against the wall, trying to figure out what's what's going on? How much of that is going on right now? Yeah. So it's much more stable, it's much more stable now. It's
[52:04] already a lot of logs, we haven't reset the chain, it wasn't halted. There was some halts, chains, chain stops in the past, maybe three weeks, two weeks, or something around New Year. But Ivan
[52:20] from the Dash platform was able to fix the issue without resetting the chain. So the chain is working pretty fine, pretty stable, and it basically has pretty good bandwidth capacity.
[52:36] It easily handles 1000 transactions in the block, it processes the transactions very fast. There is, I admit, there is a couple of things, there are some issues and some, you know,
[52:52] in the Dash SDK. The Dash SDK is not really a thing that the Dash platform team is constantly working on. They are working on the core things like Drive, TenderDash, and all the things they
[53:08] don't have much developers right now. Yeah, and just so people know what he's talking about there, the Dash SDK is the library that the developers put into their project. So I have a
[53:22] website and I want to interact with Dash platform or have some storage for my, you know, some global storage for my application. I import the Dash SDK, it's a library that you put into your code,
[53:36] and that's what he's talking about. So you're saying that they haven't had much time to work on that because they're working on lower level infrastructure things that the Dash SDK wraps up
[53:48] and includes supposedly in an easy to way, easy to consume way. And my experience was, quite frankly, it was very poor with the Dash SDK. And that's because they haven't focused on it,
[54:04] right? That's because they haven't had time to focus on it. Not a criticism, just my honest experience with it. And so here's something that I was thinking about this morning.
[54:15] I do want to improve the Dash SDK. And so just I'm going to take a little tangent for maybe two minutes here. When we first started, like maybe a year ago, I got AJ involved, I got
[54:30] Jojo bite involved, I got several other people involved. Anthony Campolo, I got several people involved trying to trying to work with like building an application on Dash platform.
[54:42] And between the documentation, platform stability, poor performance with the SDK, I realized that we need better performing, lower level tooling for building Dash applications. And
[55:03] so I sent AJ down a rabbit hole to build several libraries from scratch so that we did not have to depend on dash core lib, for example, in our in one as one of our dependencies. And so he rebuilt
[55:22] determinant like keys, creating keys from scratch, hierarchy, hierarchical, deterministic, key generation, dash phrase, so all those things that we were talking about probably a year ago,
[55:37] I had him build those for that reason. And what I would like to have him do is incorporate dash platform into our tool set now that the incubator has built.
[55:49] And I can prompt not promise, but if, if we are funded, and if we, if we continue to work on this, I would like to as part of my strategy,
[56:02] build dash core, or dash platform functionality into our tool set. And I think that we could probably get it to where it was at least 10 times faster, and at least 10%, or 10 times smaller,
[56:21] 10% of the size. And that's just, I think that's conservative. So I would love to do that. Would that make any improvement in just what I'm understanding is the constant finding of
[56:36] bugs atmosphere there? Or is that something different? Well, I'm sure that we would come across bugs along the way. But, but yeah, like what I'm,
[56:46] what I'm saying is, the dash SDK, as it is right now, and I'm sure DCG is completely frustrated with this as well. They would hopefully welcome something like this, where you could have access
[57:00] to dash platform, all the infrastructure that we've been spending all this time and money on, you can have access to that in a simpler and easier to use SDK, that doesn't have any of the
[57:12] legacy dependencies. And we would need the dash at the current dash SDK in order to use as a reference to like, okay, how is it connecting with dash platform. But if we use our underlying
[57:24] tools that we've built, I think that we could get at least get it to be 10 times faster, and 10% of the size. So you agree with that, Mikhail?
[57:35] Yeah, I agree with that. The more libraries we have, the more good, the more better for us. I don't think web2 developers will tolerate it in its existing state. I looked at, you know, if I,
[57:49] maybe if you could go to my screen again, I'm going to go to BundlePhobia. And I've shown this before, but I don't think it was in any kind of mainstream. I haven't seen it. If you go to
[58:05] BundlePhobia, and you look for the dash SDK, what BundlePhobia is doing is it's searching npm packages. So the name of the package in npm is just dash straight up D A S H, it's enormous.
[58:22] And if you go on here, I'm not sure if you're seeing my screen. Are you seeing my screen? Yeah. So right now it's bundling the package. So it's downloading the dash SDK that we've been
[58:36] talking about. It's bundling it. It's doing the npm scripts that it's supposed to do. It's calculating the file sizes. And just the fact that it's taking this long for BundlePhobia to do this
[58:50] work. I'm pretty sure. I can tell you it's at least 70 megabytes in the npm to the load. The npm package. So basically it is because it contains a lot of proofs, a lot of WASM code to
[59:09] run stuff. And actually I already raised an issue in the GitHub. So something 10 releases ago, something was edited in the dash SDK that raised the size of the dash SDK twice. So 70 megabytes
[59:27] is not accepted in any project. It may be okay in the backend environment, but if you connect it from the front end, 70 megabytes that you download each time from the network is insane. And when we
[59:43] think about browser extensions that goes even worse. Yeah. So you saw there that there was an error. That was not a BundlePhobia error. BundlePhobia is working just fine right now. So
[59:58] just to show that I went to the dash core lib library, which is under the scoped repository, the scoped organization at dash evo and then dash core lib. So it gets the latest version
[60:11] and you can see just this one dependency, which is a dependency of the dash SDK is 1.3 megabytes. And that's minified. But it'll take nine seconds on a slow 3G network to download this. Just to
[60:31] download this. That's just one of the libraries. And like Mikhail was saying, the dash SDK is probably about 50 or 60 times as big as this. I'm going to try the dash one just again, because I
[60:49] have had success with it occasionally and it may or may not work. So it's getting a build error. I think that that's because of the size. But anyway, what I'm saying is it's no criticism
[61:08] really. Like dash core group has been focused on more lower level infrastructure things, but this is where the dash SDK is where all of our developers will meet dash. Like that's the
[61:23] thing that they interface with. So if we're hoping for people to start building applications on dash platform, it's the dash SDK that really needs to work. So anyway, that's part of my plan.
[61:36] If we could go back to my screen real quick and I'll share some of the other parts of my plan this coming quarter. Dash platform contributions. Like I said, I'm going to be going through this
[61:49] process of building a just a basic hello world dash platform app. I'm going to live stream the whole thing so people can see what problems I face as just an average or even below average
[62:03] developer, which I think that we should be catering to. We shouldn't be catering to experts. We should be catering to the average developer. So that's what I'm going to be doing that. I'm
[62:13] also going to have Jojo bite and AJ helped me with that. If I run into problems like technical problems, I'm going to have them go through the same thing, but I'm going to spare their time
[62:24] as much as I can because they're more expensive than me as they should be. They're experts. In terms of other projects that I want to focus on this quarter, I'm going to hand off Electrum
[62:35] Dash to Mikael. I will not be doing any Dash economics R&D. I'm going to be focusing mostly like almost exclusively on platform stuff and our web wallet. AnyPay, that's now Mikael's project
[62:54] again. And then this Merchant Loyalty Credit System, that's one up and coming potential idea that we could leverage Dash platform on again. So again, Dash platform stuff. It's a new concept.
[63:08] If anybody hasn't seen it, please go and check out the... Are you still sharing my screen? Uh-huh. Yep. That's the one.
[63:15] Check out this Merchant Loyalty Credits Incubator Weekly Show. I would like to get to this hosting front ends on Dash Masternode Network at some point. I don't think that that's going to be
[63:28] in this quarter. The community node, I meant to ask you, did you have anyone reach out who wanted to throw down some liquidity to a bonded node? I did have a couple of people that were interested
[63:43] in that. I told them that I'm waiting on version 108 that offers savers. And right now it's currently possible to provide liquidity or to bond using Dash liquidity. So that wasn't a problem,
[64:00] but I wanted to wait till version 108 landed, which just happened today, I think, before I even thought about that much more. So they're aware of that. I will probably pick that up if
[64:13] and when I get some more interest or it's not a priority. It's something that we could do, but it's not a priority. My priority is Dash platform right now.
[64:21] And I do think that this time it is ready and we're coming at it ready or not anyway. So I'm going to probably wrap things up with a final Dash platform question for you both. We
[64:34] have one more viewer question here. Is there any PrivateSend SDK stuff on the horizon? PrivateSend SDK stuff. I was actually going to get down to that. There is an update that we did
[64:49] a while ago for JavaScript Dash SDK that I would like to pick back up again. We had to put that on pause for funding and other various reasons. But I would like to pick that up. That is a priority
[65:05] for me. And now that Mikhail has got, or at least will be shortly getting the Electrum PrivateSend working well, we would be able to use that as a reference because the documentation isn't 100%
[65:21] complete. That was one of the issues that we're running into. Yeah. I will have the knowledge. Maybe I can pick this up. Yeah. So bringing PrivateSend CoinJoin into browser setting,
[65:35] which is another integration with our web wallet, I would love to be able to do that. And so now with the mobile wallets and Electrum, I think that we can pivot back to that as well,
[65:46] because we have more people that know how from the client side, how that protocol is working. And maybe we can even get some better documentation on that.
[65:58] So that, oh, I wanted to mention one more thing. Sorry, Amanda, I know you're trying to wrap up and I'd like to wrap up too. But I had an amazing call with 88i over the past week.
[66:10] He is going to be the one that we're going to be talking to next week. As a refresher, the DIF has invested in 88i Equity, correct? This is an insurance company
[66:22] based out of Brazil. They were geared up, I think, what, years ago to launch some kind of product on platform. And then obviously they have been disappointed. But you're saying you're
[66:34] talking with them now. So what's that about? I'm talking with them now. I've been talking with them periodically. But again, I've held off. We can't help them without having at least a
[66:50] stable dash platform on testnet. I think that we're getting to that point now. So like I said, I'm going to be testing dash platform myself with AJ, with Jojobite. And then when I'm comfortable
[67:04] saying, OK, we have a stable testnet platform, we can start building on this. I'm going to get back with the 88i guys. He has an extremely interesting project. We talked for an hour and a half about
[67:18] their company. They are profitable already. So they have a real business model that's profitable. And they want to use dash platform in their service. And I'm not going to talk too much more
[67:32] about it because we're already late and we'll probably be talking about it for over an hour next week. But please stay tuned to that. It's going to be a really interesting show, I think.
[67:43] And with that, I think I'm done with my wrap up of Q4 and my plans for Q1. OK. Great. Looking forward to talking to the 88i guy next week. So thank you both for the
[67:59] thorough coverage of the work you've been doing and intend to do. And I would like to wrap up this segment with, I guess, just asking each of you your opinion.
[68:09] Obviously, both of you have dedicated substantial resources to platform testnet. And from the sounds of it, you intend to do even more of that. And so as someone who is of a different knowledge set,
[68:27] lesser knowledge set, maybe in this case, I would like you to explain to me what you think the prospect is of this whole, oh, platform just went down, found a bug, just found a bug, just found a
[68:42] bug, just found a bug. In your opinion, the way you guys are going about it and the way DCG is going about it, is this the right way? Are we just entering a new-- the last eight years, we were
[68:56] just like, hey, let's add another feature. Let's add another feature. So should we look forward to another eight years of let's find another bug? Let's find another bug. What can be expected
[69:07] realistically? And what should be done, if not what's currently being done? I'm going to defer to Mikhail on that.
[69:14] Yeah, we are going really close. Bugs will appear, but we have less and less and less bugs. The platform is up for a while. It doesn't break for some time, at least. It will break, for sure,
[69:34] as we do some more testing, as we find some more stuff. But we don't actually plan to add new features that will cause another bugs. What platform team is focused right now is stabilizing
[69:51] what we have right now. And what we have, we're really stabilizing this stuff. And the bugs that is appearing, the amount of bugs will be less and less and less and less.
[70:07] So one time, it will be fine. We will have the stable product. So there does appear to be fewer bugs. Are they any fewer? Are they lesser in severity, also?
[70:23] Yes, yes. Less and less bugs. We should have pretty good progress. What we had the last few years is, first, the platform team was adding some features and also
[70:41] migrating from the JavaScript to Rust, which was done. And a lot of features, a lot of basic features like withdrawals, transfers, all of this was done. So what we have now is just get rid of
[70:55] these issues and bugs that we can see. So there should be definitely less and less of them. It's good to hear.
[71:04] Okay. Well, thanks for joining us today, everyone. We look forward to seeing you next week at the same time. Merry Christmas again to you, Mikael. And take care, everyone.
[71:16] See you. Bye-bye.
