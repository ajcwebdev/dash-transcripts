[00:00] The existing power structure is threatened. It is threatened not with violence, but by an erosion of relevancy. Of the two, the existing power structure would prefer violence on their
[00:13] doorstep as they would simply respond in kind. Their structure is, after all, founded upon the threat of, and the use of, violence. It is THE hammer in their toolbox. But it is
[00:22] an erosion of relevancy, of clout, of perceived authority that the existing power structure today faces. And this erosion, this shift, is being championed by decentralized cryptocurrencies.
[00:33] Unsurprisingly, the existing power structure is scrambling to stay relevant. They have engaged in silent takeovers. They have engaged in lawsuits. They have ramped up their development
[00:42] of CBDCs. They have used logical fallacies like ambiguity, appeal to emotion, red herring, and appeal to authority. They have engaged in character assassination, and just plain
[00:51] old political hyperbolic misinformation. All with the goal of curtailing the technology and the principles of decentralized cryptocurrencies. Because decentralized cryptocurrency doesn't
[01:00] comport or attempt to reform their parasitical institutions, it bypasses them altogether. Last December a pair of US Senators put forth legislation that was so sweeping that one
[01:09] commenter said unequivocally it would impose a de facto ban on crypto in the USA. That legalese was reintroduced last week with the same draconian aims, and with two more sponsors.
[01:19] Elizabeth Warren led the charge, hoping an anti-money laundering angle would do the trick. But anyone who does two seconds of their own research will find magnitudes more money is
[01:27] "laundered" in the fiat system she supports. Co-sponsors Roger Marshall and Joe Manchin use the tired justification of "national security." But anyone who does any thinking
[01:37] on the subject knows that the biggest threat to national security is the existing power structure.
[01:42] It isn't a comment made by co-sponsor Lindsey Graham that the real motivation was evident. He argued that "many of the same rules that apply to the dollar should exist for crypto."
[01:51] Is it any surprise that this legalese is supported by the Bank Policy Institute, a lobbying outfit representing legacy financial institutions? This is their aim, to shackle the competition
[02:01] brought by decentralized cryptocurrencies. Because if they lose monetary control, they lose their relevancy. Without the purse strings, they are impotent.
[02:08] The proposed legalese targets anonymity-enhancing cryptocurrencies, crypto ATMs, mixers, miners, self-custody wallets, and, if they left anyone out, any other person facilitating or providing
[02:18] services relating to the exchange, sale, custody, or lending of digital assets. Dang, talk about sweeping, but at the end of the day that's all this is, talk, posturing,
[02:28] and attempt to retain relevancy, to remain the rulers of their fellow men. But as Victor Hugo said, "Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come."
[02:36] And as Ron Paul added, "An idea whose time has come cannot be stopped by any army or any government."
[02:43] The ideas at the core of decentralized cryptocurrencies, voluntary exchange, trustless protocols, open source collaboration, transparency, and personal empowerment cannot be undone. Mindful individuals
[02:54] do not want to contribute to the division and to the destruction wrought by the existing power structures.
[03:00] Decentralized cryptocurrency offers another path, and seeing the writing on the wall, we have seen a healthy interest towards more decentralization in an area that has since
[03:07] the advent of decentralized cryptocurrencies remained largely centralized - exchanges. Centralized exchanges, or SEXES, have been a point of entry for many in the cryptosphere,
[03:16] and for good reason. They have slick interfaces, and transactions are seamless, but that comes at a cost, a cost that more and more crypto users are waking up to. When using a SEX,
[03:25] the user does not actually retain their crypto, they do not possess the private keys, and as the saying goes, not your keys, not your crypto.
[03:32] Now, due to always emerging technology and escalating threats from existing power structures, decentralized exchanges, or DEXES, are more numerous and better than ever. With a DEX,
[03:42] users retain their private keys, and with a DEX, the transactions are done on-chain, which showcases the crypto networks that actually work, versus those that are just hype. Through
[03:51] this experience, the best, the most stable, the most scalable options will become evident, and humanity will be better for it.
[03:58] So despite the onslaught of misinformation emanating from DC and other political capitals around the world, these tools, this tech, these ideas, cannot be undone. Saber-rattle
[04:07] as they will, and pass whatever edicts they might, decentralized cryptocurrencies cannot be stopped.
[04:13] Almost 500 years ago, Etienne de la Buete said, "Every power structure relies upon the subject's obedience to the orders of the ruler. Resolve to serve no more and you
[04:22] are at once freed. I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over, but simply that you support him no longer. Then you will behold him, like a great colossus
[04:30] whose pedestal has been pulled away, fall of his own weight, and break in pieces. Each of us has a vote in what unfolds. We vote through our actions. What system do you abstain
[04:39] from, and what system do you engage with? And why stop there? To spur an even larger migration toward uncensorable options, maybe it would be worth engaging in a concerted
[04:48] outreach effort to encourage others in the cryptosphere to transition from sexes to dexes, so that they individually can keep what is theirs, so that they and we together can peacefully
[04:58] erode the relevancy of the coercive existing power structure in favor of options that empower and that build.
[05:15] Hello and good day. Welcome to Incubator Weekly. We have a big, hotly anticipated show today because we no longer have to say, "When, Maya?" Do we, fellows? Do we have to say, "When,
[05:27] Maya?" Not anymore.
[05:29] No. Also, because Amanda's back.
[05:31] Thank you. Thank you. So, we're so pleased to say that as of, I think, two weeks today, Maya is here
[05:42] on Dash, and Dash is here on Maya. And so, to join us to speak about it is the Incubator Project Lead, Ash Francis, and then from the Maya side, the Animal Spirit Guide, which
[05:55] leads the Maya Project, Alex. How are you today, fellas? Hi, guys. Good morning.
[05:59] Good. Thank you. Good morning. And thanks, as always, to Pete and Amanda, to the degree that you help with
[06:08] those intros. I love those. They fire me up every week, and it's just a masterful narration, I think.
[06:15] Agreed. Thank you. So, let's start, I guess, at the beginning, which is the launch. Who can tell us about, because that was a multi-step process. Let's just talk about the launch.
[06:26] I'll just... Let's talk pre-launch. This project has been two years in the works. We started on ThorChain when ThorChain was early days, very little sort of in the way of established.
[06:39] I think Ryan, actually, was the one who sort of discovered them, and he was like, "Hey, we should be on this." So, we got to work on that and built that, and then the goalposts
[06:47] kept moving, which is understandable, because they were a project that was figuring themselves out, and the privacy aspect scared them. There was also some bigger wins. They were choosing
[06:56] to pursue in terms of BNB and things like that. And then Maya came about, and this is perfect for us. This is somewhere where we can prove
[07:06] ourselves and integrate and be part of this whole ecosystem. And since then, building, adjusting our sort of work on ThorChain to work for Maya, and working with that team
[07:17] has been really just the best outcome that we could hope for, ultimately. We were left in this position of the ball's in ThorChain's court. Eventually, will they consider us?
[07:28] We've already built. We've spent all this time and effort to build this integration, and then, thankfully, Maya is just another option. And it shows the nature of our space,
[07:38] really, that another project can be forked from something like that and take a different approach and be successful and be part of this ecosystem. So, yeah, two years on, and
[07:49] we've successfully launched on Maya. Long time coming. I'm very happy about it. It's been fun. Before Alux comes in and says, "Oh, we're not competitors with ThorChain.
[08:01] We're friendly forks," I just also wanted to say, I was a little skeptical of transitioning our focus from ThorChain to Maya. The Desert Lynx, Joel, kind of discovered them, I think,
[08:17] one of the first ones, and put forth the idea that we should pivot our focus to these guys. I was skeptical because it's like, yeah, you know, second fiddle kind of thing. But as
[08:28] I watched, I listened to all of the episodes that Alux put together in the initial phases of Maya, as well as pretty much all of the interviews that he had on the Maya channel.
[08:45] And just through his personality, that's kind of what won me over. He's just an extremely positive guy and has the focus of just building this better system. And like the intro said,
[09:02] making all of those other antiquated systems obsolete and just kind of moving forward without any fear of doing that. So thanks, Alux.
[09:13] Thanks. Thank you. Thank you for the kind words. Yeah. Well, it's been fun building as Ash and Alux. One of the best ways to see what we think through is just go to GitHub,
[09:27] follow Alux from Dash Incubator and read his logs, because he has a diary, essentially, of all the process of integrating onto ThorChain and then switching over to Maya. I read those
[09:38] over coffee. It's excellent. And despite so much work and preparation, there were still some last minute things like, how do we manage chain locks? I think we're managing those
[09:49] wrong. And all of that, the process of stationing it was quite fun. Maya has been doing big bets on Dash. For instance, we funded ourselves the audit of all of these work with Halborn,
[10:05] one of the best security agencies out there. And we are LPs now as well, now that we've launched. And yeah, we keep doing these large bets because I think our vision for the future
[10:18] is aligned and our communities are very much in sync. There's many other chains, perhaps with larger volume, larger market caps, but they're all just using it in central exchanges
[10:29] and just to make money. Whereas in Dash, I do find a way where people really want to just be unbanked and just really leave that monetary system behind. So just addressing
[10:42] what your question was, Amanda, yeah, it did require quite a bit of steps from launch to where we are now. One thing was having Dash be on mainnet, the code, because one thing
[10:57] is having the code be run by all of the nodes, but that doesn't automatically sparkle Dash because we need to then create a vault that everybody, all of the nodes can participate
[11:09] in the threshold signature scheme party of the vault. So for that to happen, we needed to perform a churn. And interestingly enough, the first churn did not actually create Dash
[11:21] because there were some nodes having still a few issues with their Dash full nodes. So then we fixed that. We attempted a churn 24 hours later and it succeeded. And we've had
[11:32] Dash since then, but now Dash being online and being usable are also two different things. And the three things needed for that to happen was first for people to start adding liquidity,
[11:43] then to actually have those swaps be tested and enabled. And then also having it be user friendly kind of for the layman, because at the beginning, yes, it's launching Maya, but
[11:56] Maya it's like also just code, you know, and interacting with it normally is just two terminals and stuff. So then we needed to have the user interfaces that already host Maya actually
[12:07] integrate Dash swaps and all as well. So what's coming now next is not only bringing Dash to Maya, but also bringing Maya to Dash. And that's, I think, an interesting conversation
[12:22] we will be having today about where can Maya fit also in the Dash ecosystem so that Dash users don't need to kind of stretch themselves to use Maya using a new thing they don't know.
[12:34] Rather where they already come every day, the interfaces they use for their daily activities, Maya is just there. And even they might not even know it's Maya and that's okay. And that's
[12:44] part of the Maya ethos just in the background, kind of pulling the liquidity and servicing the swaps. Now I do see a few questions about what is Maya. Ryan already said, you know,
[12:58] a friendly fork of blockchain. So what is blockchain? What is Maya? Well, it's a decentralized swapping protocol that is cross-chain without wrapping, without centralized parties. People
[13:15] sometimes call it trustless. Me and Ryan like to call it trust minimized. But it's much better to be trusting a set of, you know, 20 to 100 nodes that are economically incentivized
[13:26] and over collateralized and transparent. And you can see everything that's happening on chain than, you know, an obscure central exchange with one guy holding the keys. So definitely
[13:37] a big, big improvement. Still more improvements to be done. This is not the end of the road. We'll also speak about what other things Maya is bringing to the table in the next few updates.
[13:47] But I think that's a, that's a good overview. Great. So let's first talk numbers, which I think is something that a lot of people
[13:57] like to track. How much Dash liquidity is currently on Maya and how does that number compare to other liquidity pools currently on Maya and at their launches as well?
[14:09] Yeah. Well, the important thing is that this is the first time Maya launches a new pool. All the rest of the pools have been there since the inception of Maya when we gave away
[14:21] a bunch of cacao to add liquidity. Thus, the important part there is that the incentives were quite different as they are now. People expected, you know, $500,000 overnight. That
[14:35] wasn't going to happen because the incentive, the cacao incentive is not there. Rather, it's now just pure real yield. People add liquidity. There is volume. That volume generates
[14:46] fees. Thus, I LP more to get a larger share of that fee volume. So because of that, it's kind of difficult to compare apples to apples. Next version, we will also be launching Kujira
[15:00] and then we can kind of put them together and see who's doing what and see which community is shining differently. Now, comparing to other pools, right now we're at around $225,000.
[15:13] That's like 62% what we have in the USDC pool. So guys, let's beat the dollar. Come on. So we're very close to that. As to what that means is essentially swaps $1,000 and under
[15:29] are also already very reasonable to do on Maya. What do you mean by reasonable? Like the fee for $1,000 or under swap? What is that approximately?
[15:41] It would be below 1%. So already kind of very competitive. The thing with Maya is the larger the swap is versus the pool depth, the larger the fee percentage wise. So the fee is dynamic.
[15:57] So there's two ways to minimize the fee. You either make a smaller swap or you make the pool deeper. And that's some things that we want to do today. Now, you might say, "Hey,
[16:06] I want to swap $2,000. What do I do now?" Well, you can just eat the fees. But another option is just break your swap into two $1,000 swaps and then you're okay. The problem being
[16:19] that you pay the gas fees twice on Maya or Bitcoin and on Dash, for instance, if you're doing a Bitcoin to Dash swap. So this is where streaming swaps come in. And this is quite
[16:32] a novel new thing that Thorchin developed in their last update. They just brought it online. We're bringing it online two versions from now. So version 107 on Maya. And what
[16:43] that does is just do that for you. So you send a swap to Maya and say like, "Hey, I want to swap $10,000, but I don't want the $10,000 fee. I want the $1,000 fee." So break
[16:54] my $10,000 swap in $10,000 swaps over time. And that's called a streaming swap.
[17:03] That's called a streaming swap because it's been streamed all the time. And this way you can make way larger swaps. We're now seeing million dollar swaps on Thorchin in pools
[17:12] that are just $10 million deep. So this is great. What that means is it's just lowering the bar of affordability. It's becoming way, way more affordable to swap on the Central
[17:24] Exchanges, having a price execution similar to sexist or better than sex, like we like to call it. And also the pool that is becoming more and more irrelevant. So the question
[17:34] about, "Hey, we need a million dollars or $10 million on Dash no longer. We can make do with less, have the volume come, and then the pool be deeper." So yeah, it's kind of
[17:46] the chicken and egg problem. It's becoming less of an issue. So anyway, streaming swaps is coming. The important part with streaming swaps, aside
[17:55] from being automated for the user, is that you pay gas fees once. If you do 10 times $1,000 swap yourself, Bitcoin to Dash, you're paying 10 times the gas fees in Bitcoin and
[18:07] Dash. Whereas if you do it with a streaming swap, the gas fees is paid just once. Since what Maya does essentially is just take the transaction and then stream it 10 times. And
[18:19] once the complete output is ready, sends it out to you. Well, great. And we all know how important it would be to not have to do 10 Dash swaps
[18:30] in a row that might cost one cent or one and one half cent. That's good. Ryan, I see you have a sort of screen share here. While Alux is telling us what crypto networks Maya currently
[18:45] supports, shall I bring up this screen share? You're on mute, Ryan.
[18:49] Oh, you're on mute, Ryan. I just prepared it just in case we had time to show a demo of doing like a liquidity ad.
[18:58] Oh, wouldn't that be nice? OK, yes. But let's maybe save that for a little bit later if we have more to discuss.
[19:04] Sure. There's a question about networks now, right?
[19:08] So please, just which networks? We currently support Bitcoin network, Ethereum network, Fortune network, and Dash network.
[19:16] All of course within Maya chain network. So I'm counting. So we're going to have Kajira network soon, Arbitrum. We want to have Cardano by end of year and perhaps one or two more
[19:28] chains as surprises here and there. So this is, of course, just the beginning. But what this means also is you don't only need to rely on what coins Maya support, but you can
[19:44] now connect towards Thorchain. Since we support Thorchain, we can swap Dash to Rune. And once you have Rune, you can go to any asset that Thorchain supports. The Rune cacao pool on
[19:56] Maya is super deep. So the handoff from Maya to Thorchain is essentially fee-less. When is that planned for, Alex?
[20:04] Sorry? When is support of Thorchain swaps to like Thorchain pools? It's live now?
[20:11] Yeah, it's already there. It's live. Is it in the front ends?
[20:14] As well, yeah. On Dorado, ThorWallet, FirstWallet, Swapper and Rango, you can swap Dash to Rune. I know Rango is not yet supported Dash. We're working with them for that. But you can swap
[20:27] to Rune. Now that you have Rune, you can go to anywhere in the Thorchain ecosystem. Now we will automate that too.
[20:34] Yeah, this is why I'm talking about the automation. Yeah, yeah. This is what, because right now it's double signature. That means I manually do a swap
[20:41] Dash to Rune. Once I receive my Rune, I now need to come back again and sign a new transaction Rune to Avax or Doge or whatever. Likewise, for the way back. So we can automate this
[20:56] away doing something called pass-through data that Thorchain is bringing online already. We will be bringing online also version 106 or 107. We haven't decided. What this allows
[21:08] us to do is to nest memos. So I'm sending a transaction to Thorchain and then telling them, hey, also this data is not for you, Thorchain, it's for whomever you're sending
[21:21] this transaction to. But this allows you, for instance, to swap from Doge to buy an ordinal of Bitcoin without double signing, for instance, stuff like that. So increasing
[21:35] the composability of Thorchain and Maya. And this allows us to also nest swaps between Thorchain and Maya. So I go and swap on Thorchain, I have Avax, and I say, hey, Thorchain, swap
[21:47] it to Rune, then send it to Maya and tell them to swap for Dash. And you do that in just one transaction. Now, this sounds a bit complicated how to do these instructions.
[21:59] Don't worry, user interfaces will be abstracting this away for you. So this essentially, the question no longer is like, when will Dash be on Thorchain? Not needed. You're already
[22:11] interfacing with all the Thorchain ecosystem directly with one signature, and that's coming very soon.
[22:17] Okay, so let's talk a little bit about, now that we've covered swaps, and then, of course, the upcoming streaming swaps, and I think you said V107, currently on V105. Let's talk
[22:33] a little bit about savers also. How is that going? How can it be utilized? And how is it different from providing liquidity?
[22:42] Sure. So savers is coming in V106, so next update. It's one of the important things needed for that. The important part about savers is you're providing liquidity, but not being
[22:54] exposed to Kakao price action. Now, these lowered risk also lowers the rewards. So you are getting significantly less return than a normal LP would, but your principle in Dash
[23:07] is essentially maintained. So if you're worried about Kakao's volatility or price action, or in permanent loss, for instance, as well, you forget about that with Dash. So that's
[23:19] coming in V106. What that means is I just take my Dash, send it to Maya, and if I send 10 Dash, I will get 10 Dash back, plus some APR, regardless what happens, unless Maya
[23:32] disappears. So yeah, important part. It will definitely be a better use case for many that are looking to maintain. They want to support Maya, but they want to maintain their Dash
[23:44] position. This is definitely for you. Okay. And then is there a difference between providing liquidity and running a liquidity
[23:53] node, or are they the same thing? You provide liquidity and then you bond it. So the important part about Maya, and one
[24:02] of its main differences is against ThorChain, is that to bond a node on ThorChain, you need to buy Rune and then bond it. The problem there is the capital efficiency goes down
[24:13] because you have two buckets, the LP bucket and the Rune bond bucket, and all of them expect an APY. So you need to dilute the returns across a larger base of capital. Different
[24:26] to Maya, where it's one bucket. You add liquidity and then you bond the liquidity as your collateral. So it's kind of like an inverse liquidity staking derivative. So you're essentially
[24:38] exposed to the APY of both the LP and the node simultaneously. Essentially, in average, increasing capital efficiency by two and also the perceived return in some conditions, if
[24:52] ThorChain were also not inflationary, by two as well. So definitely a big step up in capital efficiency. That's one of the main worries and things you need to care about when speaking
[25:05] about these large ecosystems with large TVLs. That TVL is spent wisely or used wisely, essentially. So bonding Dash, LP, is also an option. Not yet in V105, that comes online in V106. We
[25:20] will typically integrate a chain in one version and then allow it to be bonded in the next version just to make sure it's all stable. So what that means is if you're supporting
[25:32] Maya already, you have your LP there and you want an extra kick, you can also use it to bond it for extra security of the protocol and get more share of the rewards you return.
[25:44] So just giving more and more uses to your Dash position. So rather than a bond being locked and being sort of useless at that point and just frozen
[25:54] and not working for you, it also works for you in terms of earning those liquidity returns on top of being used to collateralize a validator node.
[26:04] Yeah. Hila was asking overcollateralization. Yes. The network, when it reaches economic security in a few months, will be overcollateralized. In the meantime, we have Genesys nodes helping
[26:17] secure the network more. Ash and Thiem are one of them. So we're all in this together. I also saw a question about ledger support that's coming. That's one of the very next
[26:29] things in the high priority list. Yeah. Do we have a demo to show, Ryan? Take it on. Well, I just thought of it last minute. So I'm not like 100 percent sure this will all
[26:46] work really smoothly, but I think that it would help. My main goal here is to get people in the Dash community comfortable with adding liquidity and kind of better understanding
[26:59] what that actually means. And I think that's best done through a demo. And it might even be a better idea that I don't have it prepared because I will kind of fall into the pitfalls
[27:10] that maybe some other new people would fall into. And we'll just work through them together. This will be a little bit of a longer stream, but I think this is definitely worth it.
[27:18] So. So, yeah, what I have up on my screen here is I'm going to refresh the page so that you can see where I'm coming from. No wallet connected. It wouldn't automatically show
[27:31] up when you first arrive at that. And so what's our URL here, Ryan? So we're at Eldorado dot market and actually it is this this little error messages. I created that because I was
[27:44] trying to do something without a wallet connected. And that's one of these concepts that the Dash community might not be familiar with, because like in Ethereum land, everybody knows
[27:56] what it means to connect a wallet to a Web page or an application or a DAP, if you want to call it that. But in Dash, we're not really familiar with that as much because we're used
[28:09] to just sending Dash to QR codes when we need to do something. But the idea behind connecting a wallet is basically. Instead of the wallet, instead of the application asking you to do
[28:24] something, sending coins every time you want to do an action, you connect a wallet and that basically means that your application is able to interact with the keys of your
[28:36] wallet whenever it's needed instead of prompting you to do that. So when you come to this page, this error message won't be here, but if you wanted to do something like like LP liquidity
[28:51] provision, provide liquidity, then what you would do on Eldorado dot market is and I'm choosing this as one example of a user interface that that helps you interact with the Maya
[29:04] protocol because it's focused on Maya, whereas a lot of these other ones kind of come from the Thor chain world. So I wanted to give these guys a little bit more credit for for
[29:17] just basically focusing on Maya. So adding liquidity, you come over here to pool and then add. And if you try to do something like add liquidity, let's say you're a Dash person
[29:31] and you want to select Dash. You have two options here. You have this symmetric and you have this asymmetric. And basically what that means is symmetric means you're going
[29:41] to send two assets to this liquidity pool. You're going to send Dash and it's always paired with cacao. Any any coin that you choose here, it would be paired with cacao. And then
[29:53] asymmetric is I don't even know what cacao is, blah, blah, blah. I just want to add liquidity because people say add liquidity to the to Maya. That's this asymmetric. It's just basically
[30:05] meaning all of your all of your assets are you're sending Dash instead of Dash and cacao in a balanced value manner. And if you try to hit this ad liquidity, you're going to
[30:15] get this. Hey, there's no wallet connected thing. So I'm just going to go ahead and connect. And what that means is you have different options. So if you had a if you knew what
[30:29] this was, this ex defy thing, that might be something that you could do. Most people in Dash don't know what that is. So I'm not even going to cover it. Connect existing key store.
[30:38] Well, you don't have a key store. So that's option doesn't really mean anything to you either. Create a new key store sounds like it could be interesting or create a key store
[30:47] from a phrase. So if I were the Eldorado guys, I actually moved this up up above because all these three things assume that this this and this assume that you have something already.
[30:59] This basically is like I don't have anything. I don't even know what what you're talking about with all this stuff. I just want to play ball. So that's where you would create
[31:07] this new key store. And it basically creates a phrase for you and then also creates a key store from that phrase, which is, you know, there's some details. It probably derives
[31:17] the seed from the phrase and then creates different wallets and then encrypts them and puts it in your browser storage. That's what a key store is, essentially. But if you already
[31:28] had a twelve word phrase, you might want to do this one. But let's just start ahead. Start from scratch and I'll just put in some password to encrypt this, I guess, is what it's doing.
[31:43] So I am obviously not going to put a lot of things on here. Now, what it's saying here is it wants to encrypt this twelve word phrase and make a key store out of it is what I'm
[31:58] saying, seeing here. And I'm just going to go ahead and say downloads. That's fine. And so this would be one's Eldorado specific key store. Key store is a new term for me.
[32:13] Or you can go ahead and probably explain this better, Alex. But sure, you encrypted storage. It's the. Encryption and then stores it on your phone or whatever wallet you're using
[32:29] or whatever browser you go ahead and explain that better, though, a key store is is not a yes. Can you hear me? OK, I hear you. Yeah. Oh, there we go. Yeah. A key store is not
[32:45] specific to one user interface. Any user interface can support key stores. Your key store is essentially your encrypted phrase. You want to think of it about it that way. So when
[32:58] I'm uploading my key store, my my when I want to enter on web to or mobile to to a wallet to do something, I don't really want to type in my seed phrase every time I want to have
[33:13] one extra layer of security so that the key store is a file that is encrypted by a password that carries your phrase. So when you go into the into the web wallet, you have one extra
[33:26] layer of security against the web wallet just in case they have some issues or whatever. You're not exposing your seed phrase. You're exposing the key store instead. So regardless
[33:37] of which front end I used to access Maya, the key store would be the same. They're all correct. You can correct. You can take your key store and open on for wallet. You can
[33:48] even go to force swap that doesn't currently support Maya and your key store would still work. And it would importantly, it automatically has any wallet that's supported by that UI.
[34:00] So if I open my key store and force swap, I'll suddenly have AVAX addresses and those addresses related to my seed phrase. It's all done for me by the UI. That's why it's
[34:10] powerful for cross-chain alternatives, since it allows you to use a key ring to have multiple wallets in multiple chains. So then when tomorrow, when we have Kujira, you'll just open your
[34:23] key store here and you will magically have Kujira. So it's all just very useful for these types of things. Okay. So I'll pick back up again. I'm going to try to hit add liquidity
[34:36] just to see if it will help me add funds first, but I don't know if it will. That might be a bug that they should be aware of. So I'm going to actually go ahead and click send
[34:50] to the wallet. Cause I need to send some Dash to this wallet right now. Recipient address. So this is a little confusing to me also right here. Make a deposit. Alex, do you know, how
[35:05] do I add funds to this wallet using a QR scan? Sure. Go to, click away from that. That's to send the transaction. Your address is there.
[35:19] The egg on the right of Dash on the bottom. Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. There's your, there's your address. Okay. This, this will give me a QR code here. Cause I'm going to scan it
[35:29] with my mobile wallet. So this is bringing us to a Dash Explorer. I'm on my, okay. Hang on. I'm glad that Ryan's screen is frozen in a, in a, such a handsome face. It's better
[35:52] than when we get frozen like, I don't know, like that. Okay. We all love a freeze. Right? Well, in the meantime, obviously, you know, adding
[36:04] liquidity to, Oh, we've, we've had the screen has unfrozen. Not, not Ryan yet. Adding liquidity to Maya is very important. By adding liquidity, we lower the fees, we increase the pool depth,
[36:16] which means there's less slippage. It just, it's an important aspect of us launching Maya, like helping to launch Maya. It's obviously already launched, but we want to add more
[36:26] liquidity. So what Ryan is demonstrating now is just that process of doing so. Okay. So I'm going to refresh the screen and see if that 0.5 Dash showed up. And I, I guess
[36:41] somebody, some joker out there might let's see now, now I have to reconnect. So this is a little bit annoying, but
[36:50] Connect existing key store and browse to the file that downloaded should be in your downloads folder. Technically.
[36:57] Let's see. We can't see this folder, by the way, we can only see your browser. So there's no, yeah,
[37:03] nothing leaked to that. Okay. I'm trying to remember what it was, what, what it was called.
[37:08] It will be a dot Jason file. If you sort by time, it'll be like key store and then dash and then some random. Yeah, there you go.
[37:18] Open, put my password in. So for the viewers, that key store file is encrypted. So it's not just a plain text file
[37:25] with your seed phrase in it. It is encrypted with the password that Brian has just entered, for example.
[37:31] Okay. And I see I have 0.5 Dash. And if somebody is going to try to transfer that to themselves, then I guess so be it, but hopefully they won't. Cause I have my 12 word thing showed
[37:41] that there. So now I'm going to go ahead and try to pull now, add liquidity. I'll go with asymmetric and I'll click, I'll choose dash and add liquidity.
[37:55] How you need to enter the amount. I think I have to enter the amount. Do I have a, all of it amount option? Let's go with 0.49. Add liquidity.
[38:11] I did let you send the whole thing, right? It said balance 0.5. I don't know. I'm just wondering if it would be worth trying.
[38:18] You would have had to pay the transaction fee somehow. So it's a question. Oh, I didn't see that. I'm sorry. I should have seen that, but is this done Alex or am
[38:29] I, let's see. So we require one chain lock as part of this integration or the transaction to happen,
[38:36] which can vary. The average is obviously 2.5 minutes, but it could be up to 10 minutes rather than instance send at this stage.
[38:44] And for anyone unfamiliar, Ash, just quickly, what is a chain lock? Okay. Obviously. So Dash has master nodes, which are service, they service the network
[38:55] by providing sort of extra features. One of those features is they can act as a quorum and agree on what the chain is and what the, an immutable chain is. And everyone has to
[39:04] follow that. That is the rules of consensus of the network. So when a new sort of transaction comes in, they will all, the quorum will act in a consensus and they'll say, yes, this
[39:15] transaction is instant send. And as blocks are published, they'll say, yes, this block is chain locked. And they'll work together to come up to an agreement on that. And that's
[39:24] immutable. So Dash is immutable after an instant send or one chain lock, whichever. Okay. So I see that there's a transaction that happened on the network, and then I'm
[39:35] guessing that I might have to refresh this page to see if the stats are correct. You can just click, just click, click back to pool.
[39:43] Okay. Pool. And then stats. Yeah. It should appear there in a minute.
[39:54] This is showing the total. It's not showing his specific. That's network wide, I guess.
[40:00] Let's see. No, because he would have to withdraw it. Maybe if you go to withdraw, because if he,
[40:13] it won't be in his wallet, he'll only have 0.5 in his wallet or like 0.05 or whatever in his wallet. Because it's in the pool, the Dash that he added.
[40:22] Go to withdraw, maybe. Yeah. Well, yeah. Try Dash, try selecting Dash and it'll tell you how much you have
[40:27] available. I haven't used Eldorado yet, so there's nothing available yet. Has the transaction actually confirmed this on the insight?
[40:35] Not yet. Yeah, we do require one block. We can add InstantSend in the future. We probably will.
[40:41] Obviously every transaction is a lot faster than most other chains because they're waiting for six, three to six sort of confirmations. For us, we chose ChainLock just because that
[40:54] is the sort of like minimum level of security. InstantSends can fail with complex transactions or times of the network being really stress tested. In terms of those InstantSends aren't
[41:09] formed, the transactions are still secure, but a ChainLock should never fail. And if ChainLocks aren't happening, then we can safely assume that that transaction isn't valid.
[41:16] So that was our minimum criteria really for this. Okay. So I wanted to explain this page a little bit. This is mayascan.org/pools. And I'm at
[41:28] the bottom of the page here, which shows Dash. And you see this big number is basically the total liquidity in this pool, the Dash cacao pool. So you see every asset that's supported
[41:41] by Maya is paired with a cacao pool. All of these have cacao against them. And then there's the total up top here. So Dash is currently in last place at 125,000. And what I'm going
[41:56] to try here is I'm going to refresh this page and see if this changes to 1931. I should have added a little bit more so that the rounding would show us going up to 1931. But let's
[42:12] see what happens as I refresh this. Now the cacao will stay the same, even if the transaction went through because I didn't add any cacao in a specific way. And that will basically
[42:27] imbalance the pool very slightly. Now it doesn't show up. That could be because I didn't add enough. I guess I could probably go through it again, but let's see if that Dash confirmation
[42:38] has come through. This is a live site, so it should update without refreshing. So I wouldn't be surprised if it's still unconfirmed. It's still unconfirmed. Yeah, we'll check
[42:50] back again on that in just a minute. But the other user interface that you can use and that Amanda had touched on, but I will say again that when you come to the one of these
[43:02] user interfaces, actually, I think I'll go ahead and do that. I'm going to connect. Yeah, you can connect to your existing one from El Corrado. Yeah, I'll call it here. And so
[43:11] you can see select wallets. So it's going to select all of those. I suppose you could deselect some that you really didn't like. Sorry. And then connect down here. Click the
[43:28] key store again. Nevermind, it's still done. It's fine. It's fine. You could still upload it. Yeah, you're fine. Okay. I like this word key store. Yeah, stores your keys. Uploading.
[43:50] Now this should show my liquidity position even on this other front end. And that will give you an idea that this is front end agnostic. This is pulling data from the protocol. Yeah,
[44:02] I think one of the points we touched on when talking about Maya earlier, we're talking about 4Chain and things, but the whole point of this is it's, it's programmatic money in
[44:09] terms of being able to swap programmatically. You're not using a centralized party. It's completely permissionless and it's something where it doesn't require a front end necessarily.
[44:20] Any application could be built to integrate with this service. And it stands, you know, it's very well aligned with the whole Dash mission, which I just really appreciate about
[44:31] Maya and 4Chain that, you know, we're not reliant on some party to do KYC, to approve accounts, to have limits. You know, it's just, you can just interact with it and a program
[44:42] can interact with it. I think I may have missed selecting my wallet last time. So I'm doing this over again. We do have some questions as well, which I'm happy to answer between
[44:59] me and Alex, we can, we can get, yeah. So one time wants to know since LPing, so liquidity providing Dash/Kakao on Maya requires
[45:10] 50% exposure to Kakao, how could you try to estimate how the earnings compared to Dash masternode rewards, for example?
[45:18] Okay. Well, the first part of that, yes, currently deposits are made symmetric. You can either deposit them symmetrically with depositing both Dash and Kakao, or you can deposit just
[45:29] Dash and it will, half of it will get converted. But in the next update, you'll be able to just use a single-sided, is it the next update Alex, that you'll be able to just use the
[45:38] single-sided Dash deposit and maintain your position in Dash. So you won't have any Kakao exposure. In terms of estimating revenue volumes are small at the moment, and there won't be
[45:50] as significant amount of revenue. Ultimately that will come with more deployments and more integrations. It's this chicken and egg problem that we need liquidity in there to have the
[46:02] fees be sort of attractive for users and for exchanges. But the more front ends that deploy, well integrate Maya, be that ShapeShift or the Dash wallet or, you know, multi-coin wallets
[46:17] like Edge, then the better those figures will be. But at the moment, you know, we are seeding a market. So it is hardy days. Yeah. Yeah. And that's something important. This is coming
[46:31] from real yield. This is not a tight, fast, high inflation chain. This is all real yield. So what your future performance will be will depend on the volume coming through the Dash
[46:45] and Kakao pool every day. So if you want to invest in these and you think this is interesting for you, it also comes with doing the rounds with Dash ecosystem, user interfaces and others
[46:58] and onboarding people to actually use the service. The more it's used, the better your rewards will be. So as we cannot just create money out of thin air, we need to have that
[47:09] volume and that value be created. Yeah. Anyway, this doesn't come from inflation. It's not made up. Yeah. But yeah, you can see on Ryan's screen now. Yeah. We see already there the
[47:20] pool value. It was confirmed nicely. Importantly, he added on Dorado. He's now seeing it in ForeWallet. Importantly. Yeah. So I have 0.4862. So I added 0.49. So just that small difference
[47:37] is what got eaten by what I like to call swap fees, but everybody else calls slip fees. Is that right, Alex? Yeah. Is that where that missing piece went? Yeah. Okay. Now, just
[47:55] curious, did the Maya protocol do a purchase with half of the Dash that I sent? Did the Maya protocol itself do a purchase of cacao when I did this, or is that up to the arbitrators
[48:18] to do? Yeah. What it did is say, okay, this amount of the total Dash, do that in half. Now how much percentage of the Dash side do you have? And then gave you the same percentage
[48:35] of the cacao side. So you're now half and half, essentially, automatically. And when you withdraw, that cacao half will also be automatically converted to Dash, and off you
[48:45] go into the sunset. This is what will not happen with the saver's option that Ash was saying because he said, "Hey, I just do a single-side deposit." Well, you need a single-side
[48:55] deposit right now too, Ryan, but you need it to the dual LP. So that's where the half exposure to cacao is coming from. Will that be updated on this front end soon, that it
[49:06] will say that he has $7.50 or $7.77 in Dash and the same in cacao? Will that be updated? Since he added and he's withdrawing in Dash, it's just showing him the total amount he
[49:21] will get. So it will just keep fluctuating with everything that happens as Dash cacao changing price and as the LP rewards come in, it will just show there on the Dash side.
[49:39] For anybody watching at home, I think I just ran into another error on this time on the Thor Wallet side, but did anybody see that? I tried to preview a withdrawal and I got
[49:53] an application error. Was that- I didn't see that. I did see Major Rex's comment that additional support and help can be had
[50:03] on the Maya channel. When he says Maya channel, I'm assuming he means the Maya YouTube channel. So is that right, Alux?
[50:10] Oh, I guess they mean on Discord and Telegram and Twitter. We're always, always- It's a very passionate community. Yeah. It's a very helpful community. If you have any
[50:23] troubles on this, it's the same with Dash side. Like if there are any issues in adding liquidity or managing your position with Dash or just questions, we're always happy to answer.
[50:31] There is now a, on the community Dash Discord, there's now a dedicated sort of Maya Protocol channel as well for the Dash audience. And obviously the Maya Discord is great as well.
[50:43] Okay. I'm going to go ahead and withdraw. Like I said before, I don't know if people saw this, but I tried to withdraw on the Thor Chain side, which should have worked in theory.
[50:56] Thor Wallet side rather. It should have worked, but I got an application error. So I'm going to go back here to the Eldorado.market site. I went to pool, withdraw. That's where I'm
[51:08] here. I have an asymmetric position. I did click this available button, which populated the exact amount that I'm able to withdraw. So it probably would have done that on the
[51:19] ad side as well. So I'm going to go ahead and withdraw liquidity, signing, sending. And Ryan Hlawe says, can we get that comment back up, Pete? Hlawe says you have to have
[51:29] enough Dash in the wallet to do withdrawal from the liquidity pool. Was that the case for you?
[51:39] You have to have enough Dash in the wallet to do withdrawal from the... Does he mean cacao in the wallet or?
[51:45] I think he means to pay the outbound transaction fee. Okay. I'm guessing that the wallet would have, that the app would have accommodated for that
[51:54] amount that is required. We had to take it from your, the thing is you sent a Dash transaction on Dash telling
[52:04] Maya to withdraw. So to be able to send that information, you need to have some Dash, which I believe you did have. So you should be fine.
[52:12] I had Dash. Yeah, because he left some behind in that wallet.
[52:17] So while we are finishing up this demo, I wanted to ask you, Ash, because I know that we have a hard cap on our time today, about the Roon. Okay. So firstly, for anyone who
[52:33] doesn't know, there is an entity called the Dash Investment Foundation, which has been entirely funded by grants from the Dash treasury system. And one of the things that the Dash
[52:46] Investment Foundation did with some of their grant money from the treasury is they purchased Roon, what was it like two years ago or something? And so, Ash, I wanted to know, since you are
[52:59] more familiar with the Dash Investment Foundation than probably any of us here, how can Roon be used on Maya and where's the diff coming in on this?
[53:10] So there are multiple approaches. Obviously, that Roon has been sitting there and was held initially to help seed the launch of Dash and to just be used as a sort of network investment
[53:20] in something that was going to become a useful tool for us. Unfortunately, that didn't work out with DoorChain, but thankfully, and I actually feel better for the way this has
[53:28] worked out, that we've got such good support from Maya side of things. And it's only logical that we are equally invested in them and we are as they have been in us. And it's logical
[53:40] for us to move that and leverage those holdings that the diff is sitting on in terms of Roon on Maya. Now, there are multiple approaches to do that. Right now, it's held in Roon,
[53:51] but it could be changed to Kakao or later traded to the actual Maya token itself to actually thoroughly invest in that. Because right now, we have more exposure to DoorChain,
[54:03] whereas I think it's more logical to put the money into Kakao really, and probably the Dash Kakao pool. So I would swap back towards that side of thing and hold Dash and Kakao.
[54:16] Additionally, it could also be used to bond a node. As we discussed earlier, you can have liquidity that's pooled and then is also used as a bond for a node. And as myself and Alex
[54:28] are running a Genesis node already, we have a lot of exposure on the tech side of this. It does seem to make a lot of sense that we would approach that. Now, obviously the Dash
[54:38] Investment Foundation has been on a sort of hiatus whilst the funds have been lower. They've not had income from Dash. So it's understandable that things are quiet there and they're inactive.
[54:51] But I've reached out and I'm hopeful that we can actually leverage those funds. I have already heard back from them, but obviously it is a group that acts as a quorum. So decision
[55:02] must be made together. But they took a more conservative approach when it came to the launch of Dash and the launch of Maya, which is understandable. They don't want to risk
[55:12] funds. But I think now it's proven and Dash is live, it's logical for us to put our money where our mouth is, so to speak.
[55:21] Thanks, Ash. Okay. So Ryan, is there any more for us to see in this demo before we start winding down?
[55:31] No, I think we better wind it down. I just want to hit the questions because I don't like leaving questions unsaid. So incubator
[55:40] any pay bounty to integrate tooling for Maya. So the way I would approach this is I wouldn't do a vendor specific. I'm sure an integration can be done for any pay, but I like tooling
[55:51] to be vendor like user agnostic. So if there was a library built to create Maya transactions, that'd be fantastic. That any pay then integrated or it was built as part of that work, it was
[56:05] also integrated into any pay. That's perfect. But building something that's hyper specific to them is not the ideal approach for incubator, in my view.
[56:13] In terms of incubator projects being built that leverage integration with the Maya protocol, for myself, I will be integrating it into the wallet that I'm focused on for this quarter
[56:24] because it's logical. We already had the exposure. We built the integration. So we're very familiar with the structures. And I would like it to go into the main Dash wallet. So doing a reference
[56:35] project that shows that and then working with Dash core group to implement it, that would be my goal. I'm sure Ryan has his own sort of approaches in mind.
[56:47] >> We'll talk about those later. But let's wrap it up. >> Okay. >> All right.
[56:54] >> Well, I see many are hungry for questions. Oh, I think I'm half a delay. Sorry, guys. Sorry, what did Aluk say? >> I think he has a slight delay on his screen.
[57:09] So he was seeing the questions as I was answering them. >> Oh, oh, oh. Okay. Okay. Well, granted that we have answered the questions to the best
[57:18] of our ability and, yeah, had an unexpected demo. Thanks. Any final comments before we say goodbye? >> Nope.
[57:26] >> Good. >> Thanks, everyone. >> Thank you, everyone. Appreciate you all. >> All right. Thank you all. Have a nice one.
[57:32] >> Thank you. >> Bye. [ Music ]
