[00:00] (upbeat music) As becomes very obvious,
[00:17] the more you watch projections and forecasts is that nobody can accurately tell the future.
[00:23] However, the more you study history, the more you recognize patterns.
[00:27] And one of those patterns is that the one who controls the means of production of the stuff
[00:33] that the world will always need, no matter what, is the one who will be able to continue
[00:38] to produce wealth, no matter what. If you're talking to a skeptic,
[00:45] just ask them to try and do something like transfer money from one country to another.
[00:52] And see how archaic, see how outdated and expensive and slow that system is.
[01:00] And then say, look, you could try sending $100 from the US to Pakistan, and it might take days.
[01:10] And you can be absolutely certain of one thing, that $100 will not arrive in Pakistan.
[01:15] It will be minus hefty fees, whenever that might be. And then you can show them just how quickly and cheaply
[01:24] you can do it with crypto. (upbeat music)
[01:29] The US government is at war with the crypto industry, and it is employing a sneaky new tactic
[01:36] to try and bring it down. It's become increasingly apparent over the last few months
[01:40] that the US administration, along with various other arms of the state,
[01:44] such as the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department, are targeting any banks that work with crypto companies,
[01:52] basically trying to cut crypto out of banking services. Now, this looks to be a resurrection
[01:58] of something called Operation Chokepoint, which was a scheme launched back in the Obama era
[02:04] that aimed to try and cut industries that the government didn't like out of the banking sector.
[02:10] These included things like online poker and also payday lenders.
[02:14] It basically used the same tactic we're seeing here, lock them out of banking services
[02:19] and make it as difficult as possible for these industries to operate.
[02:23] And now they are using this to turn their focus onto crypto.
[02:27] (upbeat music) Well, they could also use things
[02:32] like central bank digital currencies. They could use social credit score system.
[02:37] And when you take all of that and put it together, the money, the movement, the social credit score system,
[02:42] you get some other things like how about a carbon tracking system?
[02:47] How about you're only allowed to travel so much before your carbon score gets too high,
[02:52] so then you're cut off? How about you're only allowed to eat so much meat
[02:56] until your carbon score gets so high and you're cut off? How about you're only allowed to buy so many goods
[03:01] until your carbon score gets too high and they shut you off?
[03:04] Sound crazy? What if you wanna buy more stuff?
[03:06] Well, you have money and you buy it. So rich people can buy more credits
[03:10] and they can keep living. Poor people, you get stuck in place.
[03:14] I know that sounds dystopian and you think I'm crazy. Let's hear directly from their mouth.
[03:19] - How are they traveling? What are they eating?
[03:22] What are they consuming on the platform? So individual carbon footprint tracker.
[03:28] Stay tuned, we don't have it operational yet, but this is something that we're working on.
[03:33] (upbeat music) - Learn as much as you can about economics
[03:39] and how the monetary system works. And you know that this whole thing is just a joke.
[03:43] It's just a scam that they are perpetrating on all of us.
[03:47] And it does need to come to an end because if it doesn't come to an end
[03:52] because of something we've done about it to prevent this from happening,
[03:56] it will come to an end very badly someday in the future. (upbeat music)
[04:03] - So what's the solution then? Well, easy.
[04:07] NFTs on trustless, decentralized, permissionless and publicly viewable cryptocurrency blockchains.
[04:15] This solution makes the most sense because it would make it possible to preserve privacy online
[04:19] while verifying the authenticity of information online. Instead of having to complete KYC to use social media,
[04:27] you could just use it as you do now. All information you generate could be turned into NFTs,
[04:32] which only you control. This would make it easy to verify
[04:36] that any information about you came from you and not from someone else.
[04:40] From where I'm standing, authenticating and verifying information
[04:44] that's posted online will be the killer use case for NFTs. The only caveat is that the underlying blockchain
[04:51] must have the qualities I just mentioned a few moments ago. Otherwise, you might as well
[04:56] just scan your eyeball to post online. With some luck, the crypto industry will realize
[05:01] that fighting deep fakes with NFTs is the way to go before governments start exploring more dystopian methods.
[05:08] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[05:14] - Hello, and welcome to the first installment of the Incubator Weekly.
[05:23] How are you today, Orion? - Doing great.
[05:26] Good to be in this discussion. These have been kind of a long time coming,
[05:30] so glad we're finally getting around to them. - As am I.
[05:34] Well, let's start with some introductions. Orion and I are co-hosts.
[05:40] My name is Amanda B. Johnson. I am a Dash fan, and I guess one of the newer contributors
[05:46] to the Dash Incubator, as this show itself is a bounty within the incubator.
[05:54] Orion, how about you? - Background.
[05:57] So I was a mechanical engineer when I went to school. I did that for, I did energy,
[06:04] industrial energy efficiency consulting for probably about 10 years,
[06:09] and then once I discovered Bitcoin in 2013, went down that rabbit hole
[06:15] and haven't been able to get out since then, and discovered Dash actually from you, Amanda.
[06:22] So this is kind of a nice little twist coming full circle here.
[06:27] Your Daily Decrypt show brought my attention to Dash and haven't left since.
[06:34] I continually look for the best projects in the cryptocurrency space
[06:39] and upcoming projects included. And I would jump ship, and I will jump ship
[06:46] if something comes that's better than Dash, but so far this has been the best project
[06:51] and continues to be. So excited to be part of the incubator
[06:55] and yeah, and having these updates now. - And off the camera, but not out of our hearts,
[07:05] is my trusty manservant, Pete, who is running the background,
[07:11] I guess, shall we say, of these broadcasts. So that covers the introductions.
[07:17] And the next thing we wanted to, rather the first thing we want to talk about
[07:22] in this series in general, is its purpose. Give a sort of verbal white paper.
[07:28] I found this bounty listed within the incubator's online materials,
[07:38] but it wasn't until I started talking to Ryan about it that I really understood the purpose.
[07:43] And so I'd like to hear that from you, Ryan. - Yeah, so I guess there are a few purposes,
[07:50] but the main purpose is, well, I shouldn't even say the main purpose
[07:54] 'cause I haven't really thought that deeply about it to order the purposes, but there are several.
[08:01] - Rewind. (laughing)
[08:05] - One of the main purposes, I'll say, is, frankly, to have more pressure
[08:11] on the incubator itself. So everybody knows that when you have to prepare
[08:17] to present something, whether that's teaching a topic or giving demos or whatever,
[08:23] just having an interview about something, you tend to work harder and prepare more for it.
[08:28] So one of the purposes of the incubator is to, of these updates, is to kind of see what the,
[08:35] well, see what the incubator is up to, obviously. That's kind of the obvious purpose,
[08:40] is to bring to the forefront some of the more prominent projects
[08:45] that we're working on in the incubator so that people don't have to wade
[08:50] through a huge Trello board wondering, well, it looks like they're doing a ton of stuff,
[08:54] but yeah, they look like they're doing a lot of stuff. And great, we'll keep voting yes for that.
[09:01] But I wanted to filter it down so that people had just a better idea
[09:06] of actually what we're doing. So the combination of those two things would be,
[09:10] we've got a lot of projects, but some of them don't turn out to be successful,
[09:17] and some of them do turn out to be successful, but nobody really knows what we're doing.
[09:22] And so we want to address both of those issues by having these weekly update meetings
[09:28] so that we'll kind of bring certain projects out, demos, progress, it won't be,
[09:35] it won't be very similar to the DCG updates bi-weekly. It won't be like status reports.
[09:46] It will mostly focus on demos, and these are gonna be shorter, like half hour.
[09:50] So that's what we can expect here. - All right, so-
[09:55] - And I did want to say one thing about, sorry. Did want to say one thing
[09:58] about the little five minute intro. - I like that.
[10:01] - Obviously this is a live show, so we want to give people some time to trickle in
[10:10] so that we have somewhat of a live audience, and hopefully everybody can ask some questions.
[10:18] I think that we'll see, or maybe you'll explain, Amanda, later.
[10:22] Yeah, I see just now, Joelle just asked a question, or let's see.
[10:27] - It's a comment. It's a comment.
[10:31] So Pete in the background is kind of looking at comments and posting some of them onto the screen,
[10:37] so we'll be addressing those. Now I'm forgetting what, oh, I remember now.
[10:42] I'm coming back to the little video intro. So I wanted to make it clear,
[10:48] like there is a purpose behind what we're doing. We're not just building a bunch of stuff just for fun, right?
[10:57] Although building and developing can be a lot of fun, but there's also a bigger purpose,
[11:03] and that's we have a monetary system that is failing pretty much everybody
[11:11] that's involved with it, and we want to be the new monetary system,
[11:17] at least that's my personal purpose, is I think that Dash has the potential
[11:21] to be the next free market money. And so these little video clips
[11:25] is just as we're waiting for the show to start to give you an idea of what my purpose, my vision,
[11:32] my mission is in the Dash incubator in general and in Dash even more broadly.
[11:40] So there's little video clips from what I've picked up or what other people have picked up and given to me
[11:47] about what's going on in the monetary systems and what our potential is.
[11:54] So just wanted to say a few things about that. - Yeah, the wording that you used
[12:02] when we discussed establishing this newsreel is we wanted to start the show
[12:09] with something that demonstrates the primary motive behind all the work.
[12:15] And yeah, it sure sets the context, I'll say that much. Pete, my request that you bring up Splawick's question
[12:26] here in just a moment, right after we establish the beginnings of the incubator
[12:33] and basically just tell a brief history of then to now, the incubator can actually be said
[12:42] to have begun three years ago tomorrow. Yeah, that was when the first payment
[12:50] from the Dash DAO was made to then Andy Freer who had put in a proposal of this new thing,
[12:59] he called it the Dash incubator. And the wording of his proposal was basically,
[13:06] he wanted to create a sort of sandbox for developers to play on what was then,
[13:15] I think just on test net, the DCG product referred to as platform
[13:21] that was then on, excuse me, on DevNet. And that was the beginnings of the incubator.
[13:28] And so walk us through Ryan, three years ago with that sort of stated scope to today.
[13:37] - Yeah, so actually Andy's original vision, and this was his project,
[13:46] this originated with being called the Dash platform incubator.
[13:51] - Oh, that's right. - And now it's called the Dash incubator more generally.
[13:55] The Dash platform incubator as it began was very much focused on building dApps,
[14:03] decentralized applications that leverage Dash platform for data storage, for payments,
[14:11] for authentication, that kind of stuff. And that's still our primary focus,
[14:16] but we're more broad now. We are, well, obviously Dash platform,
[14:25] three years ago, we expected Dash platform to be out shortly and it's still evolving
[14:32] and hopefully we'll see that soon, but we've had to kind of adjust our mission,
[14:37] our focus accordingly. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.
[14:42] I personally haven't been waiting around and just like knocking at the door saying
[14:47] when's Dash platform, when Dash platform, although I have done some of that, I have to admit,
[14:53] but I think that there's a lot that we can do outside of specifically Dash platform.
[14:58] And so we've been doing a little bit of that and we'll probably highlight some of those things
[15:03] in later episodes. I think the, just so everybody's clear,
[15:07] like this first episode is more or less history and just kind of introduction,
[15:12] but in later episodes, we will be doing, bringing more of the coding to the forefront
[15:20] and projects and demos and things like that. But this episode I think is mostly just about
[15:26] kind of introducing everybody to what we're up to here. - Precious.
[15:32] So let us go to Splawik's question, which is, Ryan, what is the hardest thing you've managed to handle
[15:41] on the incubator so far? - Managed to handle is a funny way to put that
[15:48] because I don't know if I'm managing it or not, but I'm handling it for sure.
[15:52] I think the most, one of the hardest things is
[15:59] there are a lot of developers who are interested in working for Dash,
[16:03] like probably more than I expected. But it's difficult to line them up with projects
[16:11] that can use their skills and finding out what those skills are.
[16:18] So just general human resources, like I didn't imagine myself being a human resource guy,
[16:24] but that's what I, one of my main challenges or responsibilities is,
[16:30] is just kind of directing all that energy and talent towards projects that add value to Dash.
[16:39] That's more difficult than it might seem. It's really easy to just throw some people some Dash
[16:45] for doing whatever, but it's more difficult to do.
[16:49] The quality control specifications are very difficult, like what is this project supposed to accomplish?
[16:56] And the development. So yeah, I won't get into specifically
[17:02] what all of our task structure is right now, but what we call the production tasks,
[17:07] that can be some of the more straightforward work, what a lot of people might imagine to be the hardest work,
[17:14] but it's actually in between the before and after that's more difficult, in my opinion.
[17:20] - Righteous. So this next question that has been submitted
[17:25] by the name of the person who submitted it, is really timely for what we are going to show next week.
[17:35] As Ryan mentioned, this week is primarily a hello and just who we are, where we came from.
[17:45] And next week is going to be a visual walkthrough of every online instance of incubator presence,
[17:56] namely website, what's that for? A Trello board, is that the same place?
[18:01] Is that something different? What's that for?
[18:04] Can I live chat with anybody to ask questions? What's this, what's that?
[18:08] And so we will for sure be getting that to you next week in a hopefully executable format,
[18:16] so that you can get joined up as soon as possible if you are still interested.
[18:21] And so before we get to that next week, Ryan, will you give us just a basic overview
[18:30] of like the humans who are involved? Is this like a board of 10 people?
[18:35] Is it Ryan and everybody else? Is there a pyramid?
[18:40] Is there a, like, what is the structure? - Question, I'm actually just bringing up
[18:47] the Trello board right now just to get a number that's not right off the top of my head.
[18:51] I don't have it handy. But I just wanted to say, okay,
[18:56] so the structure, the human structure of the incubator is that we have over 200 people who have been
[19:04] or are involved or both in the incubator, 202 to be specific.
[19:09] Actually, no, let's see, 207, that many plus 202. So 207, so kind of a lot of people,
[19:17] and most of those are not active right now. I would say, if I had to guess,
[19:22] I'd probably say that we have maybe 30 active developers and active is even very broad scale, sliding scale.
[19:33] There are some that are close to full time like myself and a few of our, like one, at least one of our developers.
[19:40] And the overall structure is that we have contributors. I guess we'll call them roles.
[19:47] There's a few different roles. There's contributors who is anybody
[19:51] that's involved with the incubator. There are, and that would include developers, obviously.
[19:58] And then a subset of those contributors, we have admins who are basically project managers.
[20:06] They're called admins. Originally, I think they had admin rights
[20:11] on the Trello board. Basically, you can make tasks and approve tasks.
[20:16] And then more recently in the past six months or so, past four months or so,
[20:23] we added a role called the strategist. And the strategist is kind of a more responsible role
[20:30] where you're directly interfacing with our masternode operators and owners.
[20:35] - So how many strategists do you have and how many admins do you have?
[20:40] - I think there are probably about 10 admins. And there are certainly three strategists.
[20:47] So I'm the lead strategist. And that basically just means that I am requesting funds
[20:53] from the dash DAO itself, personally. My name is on the proposal.
[20:59] I'm taking full responsibility from a value standpoint. And then there are two additional strategists.
[21:07] One is Ash, who probably everybody knows here. And then another one is a guy named Tim.
[21:15] He goes by the handle-- - Spectral.
[21:18] - And so those are the three strategists. So you see their names on the proposals
[21:24] and you see the projects that they are responsible for, that they kind of own.
[21:30] And hopefully people are kind of connecting that and seeing, okay, I like what Ash is doing,
[21:38] really like what Ash is doing. Ryan's doing some questionable things.
[21:42] I don't know what Tim's doing or those kinds of questions. And so I wanted to spread out the responsibilities
[21:50] of the former role that was called the proposal owner into multiple people because I was losing handle
[21:58] on what was going on in the incubator because there are probably close to a hundred projects
[22:05] that we've done over the years. And it's hard to kind of keep a handle on them.
[22:13] But if there are more people, then it's easier, obviously. And I'll just take this opportunity to say,
[22:20] if anybody is interested in any of these roles, just to answer that previous question
[22:27] that I don't know if we gave an answer, we kind of punted to the next week.
[22:30] We'll talk more about it then. But the easiest thing to do right now
[22:35] is to just DM me on Discord. You can, to get started in the incubator,
[22:41] you obviously join the Trello board and we'll talk more about that next week.
[22:45] That's one way to get my attention. The other way is to just send me a direct message
[22:50] on Discord, that's the best way to get ahold of me. So, yeah.
[22:55] - Direct message on Discord, right on. So we have essentially covered everything
[23:03] that we were intending to cover this week. And going forward,
[23:09] we will know that at least one of the major goals of this series has been met.
[23:18] If anyone who's interested feels like they know how to essentially audit the incubator,
[23:27] either its output or its finances or both. And so in addition to, as we already said,
[23:37] we'll walk you step through step next week of like how do I get involved potentially as a contributor,
[23:44] other than just sending a private message to Ryan, which actually probably sounds like the best way
[23:48] until he gets too swamped, in which case maybe a more systematic approach
[23:52] will be helpful. And so auditing and being able to join
[24:00] and basically anything else is the overall goal of the show. That sounded really dumb.
[24:07] I don't know, am I missing anything, Ryan? - Well, I did want to say a little bit more
[24:11] about the history. I wanted to say thank you to Andy, first of all,
[24:19] for starting this, 'cause it's a great project. I think it adds a lot.
[24:24] - And who is Andy? Who is this mythical--
[24:28] - Andy Freer, former CTO of Dash Core Group, I believe, and just general advocate of Dash.
[24:37] He's the one that handed the reins over to me, I guess, probably a little over a year ago.
[24:43] And I just wanted to read the mission and the vision from our website rules page,
[24:51] because this was Andy's mission and vision. I haven't changed anything.
[24:58] And it says, "Our mission is to fund, support, and let's see, find, support, and fund
[25:04] the most promising developers and entrepreneurs to build and grow the most innovative
[25:09] and user-friendly applications that maximize the use cases and utility of Dash."
[25:15] That's the mission. And then the vision, "Our vision is to grow Dash
[25:20] to become the number one cryptocurrency for everyday payment by constantly innovating
[25:24] the fastest, easiest to use, and most cost-effective digital cash at global scale."
[25:30] So it's a little lengthy. I might consider paring that down in the future,
[25:35] but as I took over, I wanted to keep that same mission and vision.
[25:40] And the only major thing that I've changed is the big strategy portion.
[25:45] And that's, yeah, I guess there's a lot to say about that, but probably not right now.
[25:52] But I just wanted to kind of highlight that in that mission and vision,
[25:56] there's a lot to be said about entrepreneurship and innovation.
[26:01] And I think that that's a big part of what we do and what we're trying to do
[26:09] is not only the development work, but also the entrepreneurship.
[26:14] So like, if you have a business idea that you'd like to get off the ground
[26:20] and you are using Dash technologies, come to us, we'll help you, we'll help you get funded.
[26:26] That's what the incubator, that's what an incubator is all about
[26:29] is you might be too small to walk and run, but we'll help you get to that point
[26:36] where you can be self-sufficient. So we have the funding available for that.
[26:41] And specifically projects that add users to Dash. Dash users, real utility use cases.
[26:52] The Dash isn't one of those projects that's just all about hype and pumping the price.
[26:58] We really want to have use cases of using Dash as money, as a means of exchange goods and services.
[27:07] So that's the purpose. - Right on.
[27:13] Well, we seem to have answered all the questions, except I think, did you say there was one more, Pete?
[27:18] One more question that we didn't get to? Oh.
[27:25] - Is that grapefruit soda? - It is, yeah.
[27:30] Well, yeah, not grapefruit, but are you ready for this? It's a combination of dragon fruit juice,
[27:40] watermelon, carrot, ginger, and turmeric fermented into a delightfully tangy and sweet beverage
[27:49] that some call kombucha. - Ah, I'm drinking water.
[27:55] - Okay, very good. Well, thanks for joining us this week.
[28:02] Glad to see you all. We'll be, we're pumped to launch this series
[28:08] on what is actually, within 24 hours, going to be the three-year anniversary
[28:13] of Andy Freer launching the Dash incubator with, on our network.
[28:20] So without any further ado, do join us next time where we want you to bring your comments,
[28:26] your questions in real time, and we will put Ryan's Discord handle
[28:34] into the description box below so that you can send him private messages as instructed.
[28:41] - Private. - Yes.
[28:43] All right, thanks everybody. And we'll see you next time.
[28:48] - Thanks. (upbeat music)
[28:51] (whooshing) (upbeat music)
