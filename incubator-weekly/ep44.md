[00:00] [MUSIC PLAYING] Almost a quarter of all jobs will be disrupted
[00:07] over the next five years. This is according to the World Economic Forum, or WEF's,
[00:12] latest Future of Jobs report, which predicts that AI will eliminate tens of millions of jobs.
[00:20] According to WEF chairman Klaus Schwab's top advisor, this will create a, quote, "useless class of humans."
[00:28] Now, there's a quote by Sebastian Junger in the book Tribe that rings true.
[00:32] He said, quote, "Humans don't mind hardship. In fact, they thrive on it.
[00:37] What they mind is not feeling necessary. Modern society has perfected the art of making people not
[00:44] feel necessary." In case it wasn't clear enough, the WEF
[00:48] cares a lot about jobs, but not so much about the people that do them.
[00:53] This makes sense, given that the organization's focus is to create economic growth at all costs,
[00:59] probably because it's the only thing that will keep this debt-driven Fiat Ponzi scheme going.
[01:04] The WEF and its stakeholders are obsessed with technologies, such as AI and automation, that result in the average person
[01:13] losing power. At the same time, they actively decry
[01:16] technologies that result in the average person gaining power, such as actual cryptocurrencies.
[01:23] Now, you might be wondering why this is happening. Well, I'll tell you.
[01:27] It's actually fairly simple. Take a look at this chart up on the screen from Ray Dalio,
[01:32] revealing the rise and fall of power structures. Dalio reveals 18 steps that go from a new order
[01:40] to a new new order. And unfortunately, right now, most of the world,
[01:44] including the United States, are in stages 13 to 15. The WEF's obsession with technology
[01:50] is ultimately because they know they do not have the physical manpower to control the population.
[01:56] Here's them. Here are their enforcers.
[01:59] Here's us. Them, us.
[02:04] Them, us. The elites are aware of these cyclical patterns.
[02:10] They know all about the approaching fourth turning of crisis.
[02:14] The big secret is this. Knowledge of cycles gives you power
[02:17] to position yourself correctly. So they keep this knowledge hidden,
[02:23] leaving everyone else to think that we're facing the end of the world.
[02:26] But in reality, this isn't the end. It's the beginning of something new.
[02:32] History has shown us that the decline of the current world order necessitates a metamorphosis, a rebirth that
[02:39] brings forth new emergent systems. That's where DAOs come in.
[02:43] A decentralized autonomous organization. DAOs love crypto because having digital money that
[02:48] can travel anywhere around the world means anyone can join your DAO.
[02:52] More importantly, crypto's transparency also means DAO members can see how many tokens everyone's
[02:58] getting, they can monitor who's voting for what, and can buy and sell their tokens with ease.
[03:02] And when people are given no other option, when their back's against the wall,
[03:06] they're going to seek out alternatives. So what kind of alternatives am I talking about?
[03:10] Well, I continue to pound the table on the parallel economy. It's the greatest opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs.
[03:17] And it's our way for freedom. So alternatives like alternative money.
[03:22] And hence was Dash's more sophisticated DAO born in August of 2015.
[03:28] Dash's block reward is divvied up into three parts. 45% goes to its miners.
[03:34] Another 45% goes to its masternodes. And 10% is set aside to hire its own developers, marketers,
[03:44] researchers, administrators, auditors, and anyone else the network might deem worthy to hire
[03:51] at some point in the future. There's a seed of a true revolution here,
[03:56] one that could upend the way we work, just as crypto might revolutionize
[04:00] our financial system. After all, millions more people are working remotely now
[04:04] compared to before the pandemic. DAOs would make it easier to work for an organization based
[04:09] anywhere in the world. Or you could contribute to a DAO alongside your full-time job,
[04:13] potentially getting a huge payout if the organization succeeds.
[04:17] Now, during times of crisis is when we really see the human spirit shine.
[04:22] The future is bright, but only if we have the courage to light the path.
[04:27] If we succeed, then in 2027, there will be more jobs than there are today.
[04:32] And the standard of living for the average person will be better than ever.
[04:41] Hello, welcome to Incubator Weekly. Today, we are joined by a new contributor, who
[04:49] is Anthony here. Hello, Anthony.
[04:52] How are you? Hi, how's it going?
[04:55] Oh, I'm well. And how are you, Ryan?
[04:57] Doing great. I loved that intro today.
[05:01] Nice job, Pete, behind the scenes, working that one. Yes, good.
[05:06] We thought you might like it. Pete thought you might like it.
[05:09] And today, we are-- why we build today is a topic that's
[05:17] specific to how does Dash work on the web as we know it today versus how we expect it should work
[05:26] or will work in the future. So Ryan, before we ask Anthony to give us
[05:33] some details about himself, will you first tell us, what is this web 2 versus web 3 dichotomy
[05:41] that you have brought in Anthony to address? Yeah.
[05:46] Well, this will be a little bit of an intro to Anthony. And hopefully, he can add some flavor to that.
[05:51] But because I brought him in to, well, the incubator. But he's already part of the crypto scene to some degree.
[06:01] And he'll tell you more about that. But Anthony spreads-- he kind of pulls together
[06:07] the web 2 and the web 3 in a better way-- A web 2.5 embodied.
[06:12] Yeah, in a better way than almost anybody I know. Most people that are in crypto have
[06:19] no idea what's going on in traditional web development. And in fact, a lot of times, the way
[06:26] that web 3 or crypto is doing things is kind of antithetical to web 2.
[06:33] And then conversely, a lot of people in web 2-- a lot more people, in fact--
[06:40] don't really understand web 3. A lot of people, they'll probably say, you know,
[06:44] we get it and we just decide that we don't like it. But I think a lot of people don't understand it.
[06:53] And Anthony is one of these guys that he understands the intricacies of both of these spheres
[06:58] and can navigate them in a really balanced way. And that's what I like about him.
[07:04] He's kind of similar to AJ in that sense, but they're very different people, obviously.
[07:09] I'm a little more bought into crypto than AJ. I think AJ came around, though, eventually.
[07:14] You are a little bit more bought in, you said? Yeah, I think-- because I know AJ was very skeptical.
[07:19] And it was kind of only after, I think, Dash forced him to work on the project
[07:23] that he slowly started to understand the use case. Yeah, strong-armed him with Dash incentives.
[07:30] Yeah. But yeah, so yeah, he's kind of more on the skeptical side.
[07:38] But that's what I like about both of you is that you're not really buying in 100% hook, line,
[07:48] and sinker on crypto. And I think that that degree of distance is healthy
[07:54] and skepticism is healthy because it helps us improve what we're doing here.
[08:00] And hopefully communicate better between the two camps. That was always kind of my goal.
[08:05] Exactly. So Anthony, how is it that you came
[08:08] to become such a balanced individual? What's a bit of your background?
[08:13] Yeah, so I have a kind of interesting background in how I got into all this, which I think
[08:17] helped contribute to this, which is that I first got into crypto and web 3 stuff before I knew anything
[08:25] about code at all. I got really interested in a lot of tech around the mid-2010s.
[08:31] And I was in the process of trying to figure out my life because I graduated with a music degree
[08:37] and didn't really have any good career prospects. I didn't really want to be a classroom teacher
[08:43] and kind of realized that I had to retrain to a certain extent. And I was really interested in AI,
[08:49] like deep learning neural nets, like all this chat GBT stuff. I got really interested in that many, many years ago.
[08:55] And also blockchain crypto stuff. So the first time I ever heard the term web 3 was in like 2017.
[09:03] It was quite a while ago. And I wanted to learn to code so I could do some of this stuff.
[09:10] But I ended up struggling to learn to code and also learn to do stuff in such a complicated new kind
[09:17] of ecosystem that I kind of-- I want to say I kind of gave up and learned web dev instead.
[09:23] I just kind of went the traditional boot camp route and learned how to make websites because it was just
[09:28] simpler to do at the time. But I always had that interest in crypto.
[09:34] And that never went away. And then fast forward after I'd already
[09:38] been working for a couple of years as a dev advocate and I've been in the open source ecosystem
[09:42] and I kind of knew what I was doing, I got an opportunity to work for a web 3 company
[09:47] during the craziest time, like in 2022, when the whole ecosystem was at its total peak.
[09:53] So I worked for Quicknode for most of 2022. And they're like a blockchain infrastructure company
[09:58] that hosts mostly like smart contract type networks. So slightly different from Dash.
[10:04] But that's where I really learned the tech and learned how to code smart contracts and deploy them.
[10:10] And that kind of helped solidify that. Like I understood all the principles
[10:13] back from when I first learned about the scene. And then I understood how the web
[10:16] worked because I'd just been a regular web developer. So then I got to actually work on the web 3 stuff.
[10:21] And at that point, I was also just really interested in this conversation that Ryan's brought up,
[10:26] which is like, why is there this division between web 2 and web 3 at all?
[10:31] Is it a useful division? Does it actually help or kind of hurt?
[10:36] And at this point, I think the term web 3 is going to eventually going to be kind of thrown out.
[10:41] I think at this point, it's kind of more derogatory than anything for--
[10:45] like I'll see people, like they'll be talking about AI and they'll be like, is this thing useless like web 3?
[10:50] They'll say stuff like that. So that kind of sucks.
[10:53] But I think it's because there's not a lot of good mainstream media coverage of these topics.
[11:01] And if anything, the mainstream media coverage is misleading. And so people get certain ideas, especially
[11:08] like things like the FTX thing blowing up. People saw that as representative
[11:12] of the whole industry instead of an example, like a specific bad actor that most of the industry
[11:17] actually would have told you not to have bought into in the first place.
[11:20] So I was just going to say, it's funny how the web 2 guys, a lot of them will say like, oh, web 3 is toast now.
[11:28] Now the FTXs and all those scams are burned to the ground. But it's funny that it's like, no, that wasn't web 3.
[11:38] In fact, that wasn't even-- that was like finance 1.
[11:42] That was traditional finance. That was traditional finance that did all that garbage.
[11:46] That wasn't web anything. That was just a classic bank run when
[11:52] there's nothing in the bank. That's old.
[11:54] That's an old thing. Yeah.
[11:56] So anyway. Yeah, I want to talk about the origins of the terms.
[12:02] And the term web 2 had originally been around in the early 2000s to basically try and get
[12:10] this idea across that people were going to start interacting with the web
[12:14] by generating their own content from it. So it used to be there would be websites.
[12:19] And websites were just like academic papers and databases and universities and random bloggers
[12:27] who were eccentric people into weird subjects. And then at a certain point, we started
[12:32] getting these social networks and blogging platforms. And people realized that actually platforms
[12:39] were going to become a way for anyone to be a publisher of their own kind of content.
[12:44] So that was the web 2 idea. And that's what led to the sum total of what we now
[12:50] think of as the internet, the vast majority of the social media companies you think of now,
[12:54] Twitter, Facebook, any of that kind of stuff. And then the term web 3 was invented in 2014 by Gavin--
[13:04] I think Gavin Wood. Yeah, Gavin Wood.
[13:06] He's the one who created Ethereum with Vitalik. He was one of the original people who did that.
[13:13] And so the term web 3 was meant to kind of riff on web 2. And the idea being that not only now
[13:21] when we will be able to write to the internet, but we'll also be able to have ownership and permissions
[13:26] around the things we write to the internet. Because that's what there isn't in web 2
[13:30] is that you don't actually own the content you're writing. Like the platform you're putting it on owns your writing.
[13:37] They can do whatever they want. That's reality is like banning issues and de-platforming
[13:41] and stuff like that. So the web 3 idea was let's get--
[13:45] Well, web 3-- so web 2, just to comment on that. Web 2, in my opinion, was a very big step down
[13:53] in terms of ownership. Because these--
[13:56] It was a step down ownership for usability. Because most people weren't going
[14:01] to learn to actually host their own blog. So it was a compromise.
[14:03] That was the big downfall is nobody wants to host their own website.
[14:07] And so it's way easier to just contract-- not contract, but way easier to just use one of these platforms, which
[14:12] are owned by, for the most part, VC-backed corporations. And that was fine in the beginning.
[14:18] But we're now seeing that that was a huge mistake in terms of de-platforming, like you were saying,
[14:25] and just generally being in control of your content and your audience.
[14:31] So then, gentlemen, tell us, how does the content of this newest project in the incubator, which
[14:40] is being called Web Framework Integrations, how does it go about addressing some of these things
[14:46] you've been talking about? Yeah.
[14:48] So it's a little bit of a shift of gears. It is very related, though.
[14:53] Because I think a lot of the things that-- like Ethereum land and EVM, smart contract platforms,
[15:01] they're kind of-- well, they're not doing away with web 2.0.
[15:05] But web 3.0 really relies on web 2.0, because that's where the user interface is built.
[15:11] So if you want any kind of interaction with your user, which obviously you do in anything web 2.0 and beyond,
[15:20] you need a user interface. And these user interfaces, they all have--
[15:26] there's a lot of frameworks. And I'll let Anthony talk to this.
[15:31] But there's an explosion of web frameworks that help you build these user interfaces.
[15:37] And people probably don't realize, unless you've really been following it closely,
[15:42] how big of an industry this is. Yeah, and so it's all just JavaScript, good old JavaScript.
[15:49] Because everyone was using JavaScript to write the web 2.0 applications.
[15:53] And then as it got increasingly complex, there was a need for more sophisticated tools
[15:59] to create these front ends with. So you started seeing the creation of things
[16:04] like React, Angular, Vue. Some of these were created by companies
[16:09] like Google and Facebook. Some were just created by individuals
[16:12] who were kind of scratching an itch. And now, those have become the dominant way
[16:17] that all web people basically make websites. Like when I did my boot camp, it was a six-month curriculum.
[16:24] And we learned React. Like 90% of it was just learning React.
[16:28] And that's kind of what people will tell you when you're getting into the industry.
[16:32] They're like, you got to learn JavaScript. And then if you want a job, you're
[16:36] going to be best suited by learning React. Because that's where the most companies are building
[16:39] and where the most jobs are. But there's all these other frameworks now
[16:43] that are kind of competing with React. So if you want to be kind of welcoming to web 2.0 devs,
[16:51] the best way to do that is by kind of meeting them wherever they are, which usually involves
[16:55] having some sort of example app or a starter that just shows, how do I get a boilerplate front end in this framework?
[17:02] Connected to whatever the back end is, which can be a smart contractor, can be a network
[17:07] like Dash or whatever. Yeah, whatever the back end is, is the key phrase there.
[17:13] Because traditionally in web 2.0, you're connecting to just a normal server
[17:18] that, in a lot of cases, is another platform that's hosting a serverless function or something like that.
[17:28] And then the other part of the back end is the database. Where are you actually storing the data?
[17:32] And so Ethereum came along and said, we want a lot of computation.
[17:37] We want to kind of offload the back end to these smart contracts.
[17:42] So instead of running your functions, your back end functions on a server,
[17:48] we will be your world computer. And that was the way that it was pitched originally.
[17:54] And so that's where the execution happened. But Anthony, correct me if I'm wrong here,
[18:01] but Ethereum, from my perspective, never really got the hosting of data down very well.
[18:07] In fact, it's very expensive to host, to just store your data on the Ethereum network.
[18:14] So that-- You ended up with stopgaps, where
[18:18] you had these layer 2s that would kind of offload computation.
[18:22] And then you'd have decentralized storage networks like IPFS or Filecoin.
[18:27] So you ended up kind of augmenting your smart contract with these other decentralized services
[18:32] where the data would actually live. And then everything gets super complicated.
[18:37] Yeah, and that's where Dash Platform comes in with-- we are providing a service to host that data, just the data.
[18:45] And so instead of doing execution primarily, we're primarily focused on data storage.
[18:53] And we will need back-end functions and execution still in the web 2 world.
[19:00] So that's another part of this integration, is Anthony mentioned some of the front-end frameworks,
[19:06] user interface frameworks, like React, Vue, and Angular. And there are new ones as well, like SolidJS, Quick, and Svelte,
[19:16] things like that. So like Anthony was saying also, we
[19:20] need to have example apps in all of these frameworks, but not just the front-end ones, but also the, quote unquote,
[19:29] "full stack" ones, where it's not just the user interface that the framework is doing.
[19:34] The framework also has a server component that then connects further to a back-end.
[19:41] And so instead of React, you might look for something like Remix that
[19:49] adds the server-side component as well, or something in the SolidJS land,
[19:55] you would have the Solid Start framework, which adds the back-end component.
[20:00] But none of those really integrate deeply with databases.
[20:06] So each one of these frameworks will then have further integrations where it's like, OK, this
[20:12] is the Solid Start recipe plus-- kind of a lot of combinations really quickly.
[20:20] Or plus this other database, or plus this other database. And so the combinations of these things can explode.
[20:27] And so what we will want to do is we'll want to have example apps where the front-end frameworks
[20:34] can connect directly to the Dash blockchain for data storage if you don't need any kind of back-end,
[20:39] but you want some storage. But then also, another one that I wanted to mention
[20:46] was, for React, there's a framework called Next. And that adds the back-end components.
[20:53] And so integrating with that, but using the Dash platform for data storage, would be something
[20:59] that that community would be interested, or might be interested.
[21:02] And that's what we want to do, is say, hey, community, like Next.js community, here's your framework,
[21:11] plus using Dash platform for data storage, and/or payments, and/or authentication.
[21:18] And so those three things, actually, is kind of my goal with this project is,
[21:26] can we add Dash payments, authentication, and storage? In fact, the way that I think about it is SPA.
[21:36] You'll be familiar with that term SPA, Anthony, which typically means single-page application.
[21:44] Which is now a dirty word. Which is now a dirty word.
[21:46] But I think that the industry, as it always does, might circle back to doing things.
[21:52] They always go back, now we're server-rendering everything, and now we're client-rendering everything.
[21:59] And we'll probably find a balance at some point where people will start to look back and say, yeah, actually,
[22:04] I did like how the front-end was rendering everything, and there wasn't much going on in the back-end.
[22:12] So yeah, I think Anthony, hopefully, will be able to start us on that process, at least.
[22:20] Because he's familiar-- one of the things that you're good at is looking at all of these communities
[22:27] and seeing what the pros and cons of all these different projects are.
[22:30] But just being aware of them all is a task in and of itself, and kind of a full-time job.
[22:36] Yeah, and be able to rank order them is like, you got to start with React,
[22:40] and then usually, from there, you go to Vue. And then it used to be, then you go to Svelte.
[22:45] But now it's like, there's all these options that are kind of competing with it.
[22:48] Yeah, and we can't forget Angular, right? Yeah, it's true.
[22:51] So speaking of all of these different development communities, what can either of you
[22:57] tell me about a sort of competitive analysis? Like, which other cryptos, if any,
[23:04] are courting which of the communities we want to court? And how well or poorly are they doing that today?
[23:13] That's a really good question. I don't know which ones are courting which,
[23:18] but I know that the vast majority will just kind of go with React by default.
[23:24] Like, it's very much the clear front runner, and Next.js as the kind of React framework of choice.
[23:29] Because first, you have to pick the framework, and then the meta framework.
[23:33] So most people pick React right away, and then they pick Next as the kind of next layer
[23:37] on top of that. But I think it kind of depends on just
[23:42] where they're coming from. Like, as Brian was saying, a lot of Web 3 people
[23:47] don't really have a lot of strong connections to Web 2, so they're not really concerned about this huge competitive
[23:53] landscape of slightly different frameworks that have weird optimizations that might not really matter
[23:59] too much. They just want a front end that's going to work,
[24:02] so they're going to go with just kind of the base option, which is React.
[24:06] Yeah. And so I think the way to start this
[24:12] is-- the first thing that I wanted to start with was just simply integrating payments.
[24:17] Because you can do that into any framework. So instead of--
[24:23] Because you have a JavaScript SDK already. Yes, exactly.
[24:27] And so we can integrate payments. So that, in theory, you can get to work
[24:31] with any JavaScript framework. And getting it to work with different ones
[24:38] requires doing different things. That's why usually then you'd have a specific React SDK that
[24:43] would add one higher level step to it. But--
[24:46] Yeah, so instead of-- --that far here, we just need to show how to do it.
[24:50] Yeah, so instead of having an SDK, how you would expect it to--
[24:56] what you would expect to have if you were building a vanilla JS application--
[25:02] kind of bump that up to the next level, where instead of just an SDK, you actually
[25:06] have a React component that does payments, or receives payments, or something like that.
[25:12] So yeah, those are the kinds of things that we're going to explore.
[25:16] And Ryan, could I ask-- so when you say the first thing you want to tackle is payments,
[25:21] are we talking about providing the kinds of things that could potentially tempt people away
[25:27] from what seems to be the current go-to of accepting Dash, or really any crypto payments?
[25:34] But it's like, oh, which service provider should I use? I should use nowpayments.io, or whatever their domain is,
[25:42] or the coin payments. Is the reason that people use those services
[25:46] because we don't have what you're talking about? I think probably the main reason that people
[25:52] would reach for those services is that they want multiple coin support.
[25:56] And I can't blame them for that, because as an application developer, you want to support as many customers as possible.
[26:04] But it also, I think, might be a little bit of a further step than most people might want to take.
[26:11] So integrating with coin payments-- I don't know, actually.
[26:15] That's one of the things that I've wanted to do, is just have a project that goes through each one of those
[26:23] payment processor integrations, and sees what the process is, and develops that in a way
[26:31] that other people can look at and see, OK, if I wanted to use this payment provider, let's say BTC Pay
[26:37] Server integrated with Dash, how would I go about doing that? So that's something that I have been and still
[26:44] am kind of interested in. But I think this is a simpler approach that just says, OK,
[26:51] all you have to do is put this script tag in to your application, and bam, you're off.
[26:56] And now you can make payments and receive payments in your application.
[27:01] But again, this is a big topic that many people have different ideas about, like what's
[27:06] the best user experience? Should I ask application developers
[27:09] to integrate with a web extension? Should I ask them to drop in a script tag?
[27:16] So we don't have all the answers for these yet, but that's part of the thing that we're going to explore,
[27:20] and just see what works best. And I anticipate that this project
[27:24] is going to be kind of like a base starting point for several projects that we'll spin out of this,
[27:31] because it's a huge chunk of work to integrate with all of these platforms and frameworks.
[27:37] The Dash skunks works now. Yeah, so I mean--
[27:41] Did he just say skunks works? He did.
[27:43] Oh, Anthony, I don't know if you knew that that was a term that was thrown around, actually,
[27:47] by the founder of Dash some six years ago or something. But anyway, I like that you just said it.
[27:53] Does that bring you back, Amanda? I love just doing random projects that teach you
[28:00] things while doing it. Like, it's cool.
[28:03] Yeah, yeah, it's better than skunks work projects. But yeah, it's a lot of work.
[28:08] So we're going to need-- if you're listening to this or watching this,
[28:11] and you are interested in, oh, I love Angular. I love Svelte. I love React.
[28:16] I love blah, blah, blah. I'm a remix guy.
[28:21] We need your help. We can give you bounties for integrating Dash.
[28:26] Again, SPA, that stands for, in this case, storage, payments, and authentication.
[28:35] So those are the three things that I'm interested in utilizing Dash for in applications.
[28:42] And I think the easiest one is just the payments. So we can probably start with that.
[28:46] Great. So for anybody interested in what Ryan has just said,
[28:51] Ryan's and Anthony's contact information are in the description of this video.
[28:56] And then the work card, the bounty card, reward card that gives more details about this project
[29:04] is also in the description section. And as we get closer to wrapping up,
[29:09] Anthony, I just was curious, and obviously no need to answer, but is this going to be your first time being
[29:17] paid directly in crypto for your development work? I think so, yeah, because when I worked at Quicknode,
[29:28] I think they gave you the option to take your payments in cryptocurrency.
[29:31] But I was just getting a regular paycheck. But yeah, I mean, I already own a bunch of crypto, so I'm good.
[29:38] Yeah. Well, that's good news.
[29:41] Well, we hope-- one of the nice things about getting paid in Dash is that you can also
[29:45] help us test using Dash in the real world. Exactly, which we did.
[29:51] We did. Oh, yes, we did, yeah.
[29:53] We met up recently in Salt Lake City. He was out here for one of these Web 2 conferences.
[30:01] And so I was like, hey, let's meet up and have lunch. And so we found a place that accepts Dash
[30:08] through Dash Direct, and-- It was a bit of a process.
[30:13] I will have to say that it was a bit of a process. So we have some feedback to give to the people,
[30:19] including our own Dash core group. I think that the mobile app played a little bit of a part
[30:26] in some of the struggles. Mobile apps are hard.
[30:29] And that's something I know absolutely nothing about. I've never worked on a mobile app at all,
[30:33] so I sympathize with the challenges there. Yeah, but also just the choice to make the Dash Direct
[30:43] experience be a two-application experience where you're switching between--
[30:49] you can start in either app now that the Dash merchants through Dash Direct are integrated
[30:56] into the Dash mobile wallet. So you can start there, but then you're
[31:01] flipping over to the other app. And then you're flipping from that app
[31:04] back to the Payments app. It's a bit of a--
[31:08] I wonder if there's something that we could improve there. So just that might be a different project altogether.
[31:15] But yeah, like integrating Dash into-- we do have another project where we're building a wallet.
[31:23] And so maybe if we could have both the purchasing of the gift card and the payments coming from one app,
[31:32] it might be a better experience. But we'll see.
[31:37] I'm not sure if that's even possible with the way that Dash Direct is set up.
[31:41] We'll look into it. So I have one final question.
[31:46] Anybody who is currently following Dash Incubator on Twitter may have seen that this past week we tweeted
[31:53] something about something I actually just discovered, which was that the general repository for Dash tools, which
[32:03] is what AJ has talked to us about frequently recently, is under an even larger umbrella called the Dash Hive.
[32:12] And that this Dash Hive is a-- correct me if I'm wrong-- a JavaScript development
[32:18] association based in Salt Lake City. And so given that you both have seen each other in Salt Lake
[32:24] City this past week, I just wanted to ask, is there something special going on in the area?
[32:31] Is this something that people who are either maybe interested in willing to relocate or just JavaScript freaks or whatever?
[32:40] Tell them what's going on there that's special, if any. Well, the Dash Hive organization on GitHub
[32:48] was something that I created a long time ago. And I've since-- so I think it was probably, I don't know,
[32:57] maybe even five or more years ago, I created that when I was just getting into Dash.
[33:05] And I wanted to do some work with other people in my area because I was hosting the Dash meetup.
[33:12] And so I created that organization. And I think I might have got funded for something
[33:18] a long time ago back then and got it started. But it kind of just sat dormant for a while.
[33:25] But then when I got back into the Dash incubator and I wanted to start doing some--
[33:31] when I was doing more work with the Dash incubator, I wanted a place for my own section of the incubator
[33:38] where I could host the projects that I was working on, personally.
[33:41] And so that's kind of where I just brought it back and said, we'll just put this code base in this repo
[33:48] just because I don't want it to get lost in the noise of all the other things going on
[33:52] in the incubator. So that's more or less where that came from.
[33:56] I don't know if we could make it bigger or not. Or maybe at some point, I might split off from the incubator
[34:02] and do the Dash Hive thing. I don't know.
[34:05] We'll see. Anthony, what was your experience in Salt Lake City
[34:10] this past week? Was it standard dev stuff?
[34:14] Did you find that there was any sort of particular energy? I'm trying to understand for myself, if nothing else.
[34:19] Yeah. Well, I mean, when you go to a conference,
[34:21] you're kind of just in that conference. So it was very specific to that, which was Remix.
[34:28] And I was going for my job at Edgeo. So we were talking about serverless functions and stuff
[34:36] like that. So Edgeo is one of these numerous platforms that does that.
[34:40] So we integrate with frameworks like Remix. So I was going there to just network with people
[34:46] from that ecosystem. And also, we were kind of like media partners with them.
[34:50] We have our podcast JavaScript Jam. So we were interviewing speakers and doing podcasts and stuff
[34:55] from there. So yeah, I mean, I find it interesting that--
[34:58] and me and Ryan were talking about this when we were there-- is that there's actually quite a large chunk
[35:03] of very visible public React developers and JavaScript developers in Salt Lake City.
[35:11] And yeah, it's hard to kind of put your finger on exactly why. But I remember when I was first getting into this,
[35:18] people like Charles Maxwood, and Kenzie Dodds, and Tyler McGinnis, those very prominent kind of JavaScript
[35:25] people were all Mormons from Salt Lake City. And that was something I always kind of had in the back
[35:31] of my mind. I was like, I should really check out Salt Lake City
[35:33] sometime. The networking is strong here.
[35:36] Yeah. Seems like it.
[35:37] Well, righteous. Well, shoot, if you ever end up here, Anthony,
[35:41] I know that I would be glad about that. And I'm sure a lot of other people would as well.
[35:45] So do either of you have any final comments before we say adieu?
[35:51] Anthony, did you want to say something about Edge.io, a little bit more about what you do there?
[35:58] Yeah. Yeah, so I'm a developer advocate.
[36:00] So I do kind of similar stuff for all the companies I work for in open source projects.
[36:05] And it's going to be similar to what I'll be doing for Dash, which is I build example apps, and I write blog posts,
[36:11] and I interview people for podcasts, and I guest on other people's podcasts.
[36:16] And so just kind of like, I do all this kind of media to hopefully explain the tools and not just kind of like,
[36:23] market them and shill them. So I'm very big on kind of treating this more
[36:28] like an education role than anything else. But Edge.io is a deployment platform
[36:34] that you can kind of think of similar to something like Cloudflare or Fastly, where it's
[36:40] like a very large network with global points of presence all over the world.
[36:46] And we also have a deployment platform that makes it really easy to deploy your JavaScript app.
[36:50] So if you've used something like a Netlify or a Vercel, you are used to just syncing your Git
[36:55] repo to this deployment platform. And then it takes that and pushes it up,
[36:59] and then you're there. So that's kind of the deal with Edge.io.
[37:02] It has a little bit of a confusing history because it was a combination of three different companies
[37:06] that were all like 10 years old. And they combined and rebranded as Edge.io like a year ago.
[37:12] So pretty much no one has ever heard of it. But we're like 4%.
[37:16] We host like 4% of the internet or some absurd amount. Well, that sounds very interesting.
[37:22] Until the point that I would like to get to with Dash platform, where we're actually hosting--
[37:30] where we're providing web server services so you could actually deliver your website and potentially even
[37:41] a JavaScript runtime, that's kind of what I want to see out of Dash platform.
[37:47] But until that point, it might make sense to try to integrate with Edge.io.
[37:55] So we'll talk further about that. But yeah, thanks for coming on, bringing your expertise.
[38:03] And I look forward to watching-- I think I asked you this before.
[38:08] And in my mind, at least, I have an answer that you told me. I don't know if I just made it up or not.
[38:15] But I think that you said that you'd stream some of your work, which I'd love to see.
[38:19] Because I like to have all of our work as public as possible so that other people can learn from the best.
[38:25] So are you going to be streaming some of this work that you're going to be doing for us?
[38:29] Yeah, that's the plan, that I'll kind of stream as I'm building things out and writing documentation,
[38:35] and creating the example apps. And that way, I'll be talking out what I'm doing.
[38:41] So I'll be learning a lot about Dash as I'm going. So obviously, I have all this expertise in JavaScript.
[38:46] And I've worked with other Web3 stuff. But I've never used Dash at all.
[38:49] So I'll be learning all the idiosyncrasies of the specific libraries and stuff.
[38:54] So that's always fun and creates good content for other people who are coming at it
[38:59] from a similar perspective who may know a bunch of JavaScript but have never worked with Dash before.
[39:04] So yeah, and I just, I really love streaming in general. I have a Twitch channel that I do every now and then.
[39:10] And I just like live coding, I think it's super fun. Nice, very much looking forward to that.
[39:16] Did you want to stream that through your site or potentially through this channel right here?
[39:21] We can co-stream it to both. Nice, okay, well, there you have it, people.
[39:28] If you're listening to this, then you might be seeing Anthony streaming.
[39:32] Right now, up until now, AJ has been the only one that has been bold enough to stream over this channel.
[39:40] But hopefully that's going to- - I watched some of those like a year ago.
[39:43] He does so many of them and they go for so long that I wasn't, I can only watch so much of it
[39:48] at a certain point, but they're entertaining. - Yeah, and I have to watch him on two or three X
[39:53] 'cause he goes forever, but I do like it. So yeah, all right.
[39:57] - Yeah, it'll be nice to have some competition among the streamers.
[40:01] It'll be like red team versus blue team, Anthony versus AJ.
[40:04] Let's see who streams better. Very good.
[40:08] - Fortunately, they're very different focused people. Like AJ is very much a library back end.
[40:15] - Almost the exact opposites in a lot of ways. - Very complimentary, so that'll be good.
[40:20] - Yeah, AJ is not a fan of React. - To say the least.
[40:25] - Well, I'm sure he doesn't make any shyness about expressing that.
[40:29] So maybe we'll hear some about that in the future. All right, we're gonna close up here, everybody.
[40:34] Thank you for joining us today, Anthony. Talk to you next time, Ryan.
[40:38] - All right. Bye, folks.
