## Episode Description

Community members discuss whether to fund CrowdNode's MiCA license for ongoing Dash operations and weigh trustless, decentralized solutions for Europe's regulatory future.

## Episode Summary

This conversation centers on CrowdNode’s proposal for MiCA licensing in the European Union, highlighting legal costs, potential KYC requirements, and broader regulatory concerns. The participants examine the intricacies of MiCA, contrasting it with separate anti-money laundering frameworks, while assessing how each might affect Dash-focused projects. They explore CrowdNode’s current custodial model, the possibility of shifting to a fully trustless system, and the potential challenges of maintaining user-friendly features. Throughout, questions arise about balancing openness to regulation with preserving sovereignty and decentralized innovation, emphasizing the importance of transparent interactions with regulatory authorities. As the dialogue unfolds, they address funding logistics, speculate on long-term compliance costs, and discuss how success in securing a MiCA license could establish precedents for other Dash initiatives. By weighing custodial solutions against decentralized alternatives, the discussion underscores the community’s commitment to exploring a regulatory path that upholds both compliance needs and core Dash principles.

## Chapters

### 00:00 - 03:10 Introduction and Overview

In these opening minutes, the host welcomes Andreas to the show and sets the stage for their discussion on CrowdNode’s MiCA proposal. They acknowledge that the clock is ticking toward an important funding deadline, emphasizing the proposal’s short window for voting. Early mention is made of alternative proposals on the table, including one that requests the same amount of Dash but redirects it to a different address. This interplay underlines the competitive environment for Dash’s treasury each month.

The two speakers also briefly revisit CrowdNode’s history, highlighting Andreas’s role in explaining the need for compliance. They note the importance of legal clarity in the European Union and emphasize that looming regulations could have a sizable impact on CrowdNode’s operations. By outlining the context in which the proposal arises, they establish the framework for a thorough conversation on whether or how the community should support CrowdNode’s licensing efforts.

### 03:10 - 08:32 Funding Needs and Alternative Proposals

Here, the participants lay out the cost and scope of CrowdNode’s proposal: 255 Dash for two months, aimed at covering external legal and compliance expenses. They explain that these funds will not suffice to finish the entire process, but represent a significant starting point. Andreas references discussions with lawyers who estimate high hourly fees for crafting legal opinions and overseeing audits, emphasizing how quickly expenses can mount.

Meanwhile, attention shifts to a separate, anonymous proposal requesting the same budget but directing the money to Dash Core Group. The speakers speculate on the motives behind it, noting that this move further complicates CrowdNode’s path to approval. They outline how competition among proposals places additional stress on a limited treasury, setting the stage for deeper analysis of CrowdNode’s compliance strategy and what the community stands to gain or lose by funding it.

### 08:32 - 14:00 MiCA Regulation Basics

During this segment, the conversation delves into MiCA’s foundational aspects and why CrowdNode deems a license necessary. They outline the regulation’s core purpose: standardizing crypto asset services across the EU to improve consumer protection, combat market abuse, and clarify guidelines for businesses. Andreas highlights three main crypto asset categories under MiCA—e-money tokens, asset-reference tokens, and other utility tokens—positioning Dash in the latter category.

They explore MiCA’s phased implementation, explaining the deadlines for registration and full compliance. The group stresses that CrowdNode’s custodial model is what triggers the need for official licensing, as it handles users’ funds and must therefore adhere to specific requirements. This discussion illuminates how MiCA’s extraterritorial reach mirrors New York’s BitLicense approach, raising key questions about whether CrowdNode can fulfill all conditions or consider alternative paths.

### 14:00 - 20:00 AML, KYC, and EU Regulatory Concerns

Shifting focus, they compare MiCA’s scope with separate anti-money laundering directives, notably those influenced by FATF (Financial Action Task Force) guidelines. The conversation highlights that while MiCA addresses registration and operational frameworks, true KYC/AML enforcement usually comes from broader financial regulations. Andreas acknowledges this parallel structure, noting that CrowdNode’s biggest challenge might lie in compliance with AML, rather than MiCA alone.

They discuss the potential for requiring formal identity checks on users depositing or withdrawing Dash through CrowdNode. Andreas mentions the “one address principle” already in place, which could theoretically reduce AML risks by proving consistent ownership. Yet, he also acknowledges that regulators, particularly if pressed by broader geopolitical pressures, might still demand more stringent methods. This segment underscores how multiple legal layers can converge, creating uncertainty around final compliance costs and obligations.

### 20:00 - 26:00 Legal Fees and Proposal Justification

In these minutes, the speakers return to the proposal’s financial underpinnings. Andreas breaks down the estimate of legal fees, explaining that specialized crypto lawyers can charge substantial hourly rates. This drives up the overall budget needed for thorough legal opinions, auditing, and documentation. Although the requested funding covers only part of these anticipated costs, the goal is to signal CrowdNode’s serious commitment to meeting MiCA obligations.

They also address community concerns about paying for legal services instead of channeling funds into direct development. While acknowledging the preference for building open-source tools and trustless solutions, Andreas argues that ensuring the legality of custodial services is equally vital for fostering trust and adoption—particularly in the European market. This emphasis on compliance as an investment sets the scene for an ongoing tension between regulatory needs and grassroots development priorities.

### 26:00 - 32:00 Requirements for MiCA Compliance

Here, the participants detail what MiCA-compliant operations could look like for CrowdNode. They enumerate essential steps such as meticulous documentation, risk assessments, standardized operational procedures, and external auditing. Andreas underscores that meeting these criteria is not just about ticking boxes; it also involves proving to regulators that CrowdNode’s platform is transparent, secure, and poses minimal consumer risk.

The conversation highlights that a fully prepared MiCA application includes multiple phases, each scrutinized by different authorities. Lawyers must first validate CrowdNode’s documentation, then independent auditors confirm that procedures match stated policies. This multifaceted approach reflects how serious and potentially time-consuming MiCA compliance can be. Although daunting, Andreas views it as a path that, if successful, may pave the way for other Dash-related enterprises in the EU.

### 32:00 - 38:30 Considering a Non-Custodial Future

CrowdNode’s trustless option emerges as a key topic in this chapter. Andreas explores the possibility of shifting toward a non-custodial model that could, in theory, circumvent many of MiCA’s licensing requirements. He explains that fully decentralized solutions often fall outside the scope of regulations aimed at custodial service providers, since no intermediary directly handles user funds. However, building a user-friendly version of such a system introduces complexity, from on-chain signing to wallet integrations.

Despite the technical hurdles, the speakers recognize an advantage: a non-custodial architecture would enhance user sovereignty and reduce legal liabilities. Yet they also stress that a trustless approach might deter less technical users, who may favor a simpler, custodial service. This tension between regulatory compliance and decentralized ideals frames the central dilemma: should CrowdNode pivot entirely, maintain both models, or proceed incrementally?

### 38:30 - 45:20 On-Chain Addresses, Identity, and the “One Address Principle”

Attention turns to the specific mechanism CrowdNode already employs—requiring funds to come in and out of a single address. According to Andreas, this practice simplifies record-keeping and could potentially satisfy regulators by ensuring that each deposit and withdrawal can be traced to one identifiable source. However, its ultimate acceptance by authorities remains uncertain, as the broader AML framework might demand more rigorous verification.

They debate whether regulators would see the single-address principle as robust enough to rule out illicit activity. The conversation points to evolving interpretations within government bodies; while some might approve of this controlled yet privacy-oriented approach, others could find it insufficient for full risk mitigation. These discussions reflect broader crypto-world challenges of balancing transparency and user autonomy against official compliance criteria.

### 45:20 - 50:55 The Future of CrowdNode and the 18-Month Window

With a looming legal deadline on the horizon, the talk examines CrowdNode’s next steps. Andreas references MiCA’s grandfather clause, offering an 18-month grace period after official enactment. Within that time, CrowdNode would either secure its license or pivot away from custodial operations altogether. They entertain scenarios ranging from raising user fees to introducing partial KYC, depending on how negotiations with regulators unfold and how quickly new revenue might be generated.

This chapter underscores the importance of clarity and decisive action. If CrowdNode remains uncertain about compliance pathways, it may be forced to shut down custodial aspects in the EU. Conversely, a successful license bid could secure indefinite operations and, perhaps, validate the approach for similar Dash services. This critical turning point motivates the ongoing push for community support and funding.

### 50:55 - 56:20 Regulatory Developments Across Europe

As the dialogue continues, they reflect on the broader European environment, noting that MiCA’s adoption is only one part of the story. National financial authorities in each EU member state must interpret and enforce these regulations, leading to potential variations in how businesses like CrowdNode are treated. Andreas points out that, in Denmark, officials have so far been approachable and open to dialogue, a stark contrast to jurisdictions where regulators may be more adversarial.

The speakers also highlight the interplay between MiCA and separate anti-money-laundering directives, which could shift rapidly based on new international agreements. These changes mean that even if CrowdNode attains a MiCA license, additional obligations might arise later. Nonetheless, Andreas insists that building a channel of communication with regulators is better than avoiding them, emphasizing how constructive engagement can shape more balanced oversight.

### 56:20 - 62:30 Balancing Legal Costs and Community Concerns

Cost remains a defining theme. The conversation circles back to whether attorney fees are a worthwhile investment when the Dash community often prefers directing resources toward development. Andreas justifies the need by pointing out that failing to address compliance could hurt the broader Dash ecosystem if regulators perceive the project as flouting the law. He notes that any official opinion on Dash’s status, obtained through CrowdNode’s legal push, might serve as useful precedent for others.

They also discuss worst-case scenarios, like forced KYC or even asset seizure, should regulations tighten unexpectedly. Andreas concedes that if confronted with legal threats, CrowdNode would have limited recourse. Yet by actively engaging in the licensing process, the company aims to minimize such risks and establish an operational model that regulators can accept without undermining the user experience.

### 62:30 - 68:45 Building Trustless Solutions and Adoption Challenges

In this segment, Andreas provides a more in-depth look at the technical steps needed to create an entirely non-custodial CrowdNode. While feasible, it would require complex wallet integrations to automate multi-signature transactions and collateral locking. The group worries that manual processes would drive away many potential users, calling for significant development effort to smooth out the user journey.

They consider who would lead this engineering push, floating the idea of community-funded development if there is broad support for a trustless approach. Yet the slow adoption of existing CrowdNode features—like an API for voting—demonstrates the gap between building functionalities and seeing them implemented widely. These realities shape a cautious outlook on transitioning to a fully decentralized model unless user demand and wallet developer collaboration align.

### 68:45 - 74:00 KYC Possibilities and European Perspectives

Attention returns to KYC requirements and the possibility that CrowdNode might need to enforce identity checks for custodial services. While Andreas hopes regulators will accept the single-address principle as sufficient, he acknowledges there is no guarantee. Nonetheless, he stresses that if compelled by law, the company must comply, though a trustless setup would avert that issue entirely.

They also weigh how these rules could apply globally. If CrowdNode is forced to comply within Europe, it might still function differently elsewhere. However, extraterritorial provisions could complicate cross-border operations, making it risky for any platform to ignore evolving European standards. This chapter underscores the far-reaching nature of regulatory decisions, reinforcing the argument that community backing is crucial to navigate uncertain terrain.

### 74:00 - 80:00 Viewer Questions: Global Impact and Confiscation Fears

In this section, questions from community members prompt Andreas to clarify what MiCA licensing means for users outside the EU. He explains that CrowdNode aims to maintain uniform service worldwide, highlighting only sanctions-related restrictions as major exceptions. Concerns arise over whether CrowdNode would ever freeze or seize funds to meet regulatory orders. Andreas stresses he has no intention to block legitimate withdrawals but cannot dismiss scenarios where legal pressures might compel unwanted measures.

They also address the timeline for building fully non-custodial systems. Andreas believes a few months of development could theoretically achieve it, but real user adoption hinges on wallet integrations. This interplay between technical feasibility and practical rollout forms a recurring theme: even the best features demand widespread buy-in to have lasting impact.

### 80:00 - 85:23 Closing Remarks and Final Reflections

In the final segment, Andreas reiterates CrowdNode’s dual strategy: seek MiCA compliance to maintain custodial services while simultaneously preparing for a trustless future. He underlines that the proposal’s requested funds will be spent solely on external legal and auditing costs. Looking ahead, he suggests that any successful dialogue with regulators might benefit not just CrowdNode, but also other Dash projects that grapple with European rules.

The participants conclude by urging the Dash community to cast votes before the funding deadline and continue discussing the best path forward. They acknowledge the legitimate unease about channeling treasury funds into legal fees but emphasize how ignoring regulatory developments may ultimately restrict Dash’s market reach. By wrapping up with a call for open communication, they leave listeners with a clear sense of the stakes for both CrowdNode and the broader ecosystem.

## Transcript

[00:00] Welcome, everybody, to our episode of Incubator Weekly this week. We've got Andreas Rudd. Welcome,
[00:10] Andreas. Thanks, Ryan. Thanks for having me. Yep. Appearing for the second time about this
[00:10] topic.
[00:17] First time we had a show with Joelle, and you guys went into some details
[00:17] about your latest
[00:26] proposal for funding assistance for compliance with the MECA regulations coming up for Crowdnode.
[00:35] We will go over that proposal in just a minute and discuss it. I'm going
[00:35] to try to keep the show.
[00:43] I know you've been traveling and you've got very little sleep, so we won't keep
[00:43] you for much longer
[00:50] than an hour. I think we'll probably try to keep it within an hour today
[00:50] and we'll jump right into it.
[00:55] How's that sound? Good. That sounds good, but I can't stay on longer. Yeah. What
[00:55] was it,
[01:01] two and a half hours? It ended up with Joelle the other day, so that
[01:01] was a long one.
[01:05] Yeah. Yeah. We definitely won't go that long, and we will try to get it
[01:05] more condensed. I have several
[01:14] questions about the proposal. We'll share my screen right now, and we will start by
[01:14] reading the proposal
[01:27] itself because it's very short. Then I have some questions about the proposal itself, and
[01:27] then I have
[01:37] some questions that were not addressed in the proposal and we'll just kind of knock
[01:37] those out.
[01:42] And anybody watching, please feel free to ask your own questions. I did get one
[01:42] question from Tanta
[01:50] Safana. So we'll ask that question as well. And yeah, I guess you'll probably be
[01:50] doing most of the talking
[02:02] anyway, but do you want to go ahead and just can you see the screen
[02:02] that I'm sharing and let me bump up the
[02:09] font a little bit. Yay.
[02:13] So this is a proposal for Crowdnode Mika license getting started. The getting started scares
[02:13] me a
[02:22] little bit, but we'll talk about that in a minute. This is for 255 Dash
[02:22] and it's for two months if I'm not
[02:32] mistaken. Is that correct? Correct. Okay. The voting ends for this proposal in three days
[02:44] so everybody please go out and vote one way or another on this proposal and
[02:44] all the others.
[02:50] There are quite a few proposals this month. It's going to be an interesting close
[02:50] to this month.
[02:57] Indeed. I'll just scan through these real quick just for posterity's sake so that people
[02:57] can see
[03:04] what proposals we have on the docket this month. And then I guess I'll go
[03:04] ahead and show this view as well.
[03:12] This is the wonderful MNO Watch site. And it gives a little bit of a
[03:12] breakdown of how the voting is
[03:23] going right now. You can see 152 yes votes, 59 no votes. And interestingly enough,
[03:23] I just saw this
[03:34] this morning there is another proposal to requesting the same amount of funds, 255 Dash,
[03:34] but this is going
[03:43] to Dash Core Group's
[03:46] funding address, but it is not written or I think even prompted by Dash Core
[03:46] Group. It's just this is an
[03:56] anonymous proposal as you can see that this gap here. Somebody's requesting this same amount
[03:56] of funding to
[04:02] go to DCG instead. So if it weren't hard enough to get funding in the
[04:02] DAO, it just got harder because now
[04:12] there's an alternative requesting the exact same funding. Yeah. Any thoughts on that so far?
[04:12] Did you see that?
[04:20] Yeah, I saw it. It's a cheeky move. I actually love it. But it really
[04:20] doesn't help us. And I think,
[04:29] you know, as to the duration and the getting started and the amount that we
[04:29] ended up putting on the proposal.
[04:38] So back in Amsterdam at the ETH DAM, the estimate from a lawyer called Satri
[04:38] Sali, which might be known to
[04:48] the community, might not, but he operates out of Amsterdam. I had a couple of
[04:48] chats with him and his
[04:54] is like raw estimate of just getting the help to do, you know, external stuff.
[04:54] We'll get into some details
[05:04] of what's going to be. His assessment was 20 to 30,000 euros. For that, we
[05:04] obviously need to write
[05:11] the policies ourselves. We need to do a lot of work to prove compliance. But
[05:11] that's just for getting part
[05:19] of the lawyer fees covered to get written statements that what we're doing is sufficient
[05:19] in terms of
[05:27] covering Mika and then obviously external auditors afterwards. And these guys, they know what to
[05:34] charge per hour. And it's really annoying. So what we're asking for here is more,
[05:34] you know,
[05:39] basically symbolic, right? What I told Joel was sharing is caring. And when I did
[05:39] the pre-proposal
[05:46] talk in Discord, I actually said that it was more likely to be 550 for
[05:46] three months to get to that amount.
[05:54] Right. But I could see the list of proposals filling up and some of the
[05:54] other proposals I actually think
[06:00] are really good. Like funding, you know, Platform Explorer. I want that out there as
[06:00] well.
[06:07] Operational. So I'm really biased myself, to be honest. But we are also facing Mika.
[06:07] And let's get
[06:15] into some of those details afterwards. But I really needed to sort of have an
[06:15] opinion from the community
[06:21] as to, you know, Crowdnode or Crowdnode not. Or what can we possibly do to
[06:21] maybe mitigate that
[06:31] that there is, you know, time is running out. But there are things that we
[06:31] could possibly do to ease
[06:42] of everything, you know, you and I have talked about, you know, building on the
[06:42] APIs and, you know,
[06:48] but let's get to touch all those points, I think, in the next couple of
[06:48] hours, hour and a half.
[06:53] Okay. Yeah. The first, I'll have more questions about the cost later. I did notice
[06:53] that
[07:00] you mentioned 30,000 euros just to get started. So this definitely isn't covering all of
[07:00] that. Even
[07:08] doubled is still less than half of that figure. But let's go ahead and read
[07:08] the proposal text. It's
[07:15] not long. I'll read it since you'll be talking most of the time after that.
[07:15] So you say, Hey, M&O's,
[07:22] Crowdnode needs a Mika license to be able to operate going forward after the end
[07:22] of 2024.
[07:29] This is cumbersome and costly license to get. Mika is short for markets and crypto
[07:29] assets and is
[07:34] required by any service provider that operates from EU or any provider that wants to
[07:34] serve a citizen or
[07:41] company within the EU. Mika has an extra territorial application of law comparable to the
[07:41] New York bit
[07:47] license. Headlines of what we have, what needs to be done. So there are four
[07:47] items here. Documentation,
[07:54] detailed processes, procedures, risk assessments need to be written. Technical changes, changes must be
[08:02] implemented to ensure risk minimal one address principle, often referred to as from others by
[08:02] as
[08:09] an exchange type address that links to you. Lawyer, so written legal opinion on what
[08:09] Crowdnode has
[08:16] described in the documentation is good enough to be compliant, possibly also a legal opinion
[08:16] on dash overall.
[08:22] Reports, to prove that we are doing like written in our documentation,
[08:29] and external audits that have that objectively proved it. For many of you, I expect
[08:29] this is enough
[08:36] information. If you want more details, start by watching this video, the dash podcast. That's
[08:36] the
[08:41] two and a half hour podcast with Joelle. There's also been good discussions asked on
[08:41] the pre-proposal
[08:47] channel in the dash discord. I could copy paste, but rather not engage in discord.
[08:47] So that's the whole proposal
[08:53] right there. I have some follow-up questions on all of this. So that's, that's, yeah,
[08:53] I'll just,
[09:01] I have some notes that I have that I'm not sharing on my screen because
[09:01] I get confused when I share my
[09:07] whole screen and I'm not sure what, you know, what I'm sharing. But on the
[09:07] first part here, this,
[09:15] this first sentence, Crowdnode needs a Mika license to be able to operate going forward.
[09:20] Can you expand on that a little bit? I guess the basic question is, if
[09:20] it doesn't, if you don't get a Mika
[09:31] license, what will happen? And furthermore, what are, are there any hard and fast deadlines?
[09:31] I know that in my
[09:42] research for this, I saw December, 2024, a lot. Um, and I also saw June,
[09:42] 2022, a lot. Um, can you tell
[09:52] us more about the, the, the deadlines of what needs to be done and by
[09:52] when?
[09:56] Yeah, I can try at least. And, and, uh, I expect you to sort of
[09:56] keep track on, on the questions,
[10:02] right? If you ask too many questions in one sentence, I, I'm likely to forget
[10:02] some of them.
[10:06] Sure. Uh, all right, look, where to start here. So I'm an engineer by trade.
[10:06] I'm not a lawyer. I don't
[10:12] speak legalese, but I'm trying my best here. Um, so Mika, uh, had a sort
[10:12] of two-step implementation
[10:21] in terms of, uh, what goes live when, right? So there's, there's a couple of,
[10:21] of, um, classifications
[10:28] that, that, that you need to sort of pay attention to. Um, and that's in
[10:28] terms of, of, uh, obviously we,
[10:35] we're considered a crypto asset service provider. Um, that's called, uh, yeah, short for, or
[10:35] was it
[10:42] cast, right? Um, and, uh, and, and that means that, uh, we're governed by the
[10:42] Mika, um, and basically
[10:54] looking at us being a, uh, cast running on dash, uh, we then also need
[10:54] to figure out, uh, how to classify
[11:01] dash. And there was like three different, uh, categories. It's like an asset reference token,
[11:09] which is basically, uh, art for short, right? Which is basically any token or, uh,
[11:09] referenced
[11:16] token, um, assets. So that could be any combinatory assets that are sort of put
[11:16] in all. Another
[11:24] classification is the EMT e-money token, um, which, uh, for, um, for a lot of
[11:24] practical purposes, uh, are
[11:35] different, but stable coins, uh, as, as far as I, I understand, or maybe I'm,
[11:35] I'm mixing the two up,
[11:42] but nonetheless dashes in none of those two categories, as far as I can tell
[11:42] and see and interpret and
[11:49] understand, but in the more, uh, utility, uh, class or what basically referenced as other,
[11:49] um,
[11:56] other asset type, right? So, so, but it's still, it's still there. It's still, uh,
[12:02] you're an element and we need to comply with Mika, but because we're in the
[12:02] utility, it's by December,
[12:08] um, 30th of December, 24, that the, um, the, the, the FSA is open for
[12:08] official applications.
[12:18] That is basically. So what does that mean? That means that if we wanna, you
[12:18] know, look good,
[12:24] be compliant, uh, it's, it's not only hitting that date that's relevant, uh, but at
[12:24] least having a good
[12:32] start, uh, in terms of where to be at that point in time is relevant,
[12:32] but there is an 18 month sort of
[12:40] grace period. I think they call it the grandfather clause or something like that. I'm
[12:40] actually not sure
[12:45] where they got it from, but that's like the time on until, you know, from
[12:45] December 3rd, 13th, uh, 24,
[12:53] where you, after 18 month following that date, you need to have your, your license
[12:53] in, in, uh, in place.
[13:01] Um, so they sort of leave a long period, one and a half years of
[13:01] time to have the local, um, financial
[13:08] super authorities to adapt and ask the right questions and sort of build, build their
[13:08] own, uh,
[13:13] interpretations of what needs to be done and how to do it. And also obviously
[13:13] for, for the companies that
[13:20] needs to comply to build and write the processes and provide documentation and, you know,
[13:20] um, get,
[13:28] get things, um, on track in terms of what it requires. Um, yeah. Okay. So
[13:28] you mentioned,
[13:36] you mentioned the three categories. Um, there's the e-money tokens, which I was saddened to
[13:36] find out
[13:44] doesn't refer to, it refers basically to stable coins. Like I think you mentioned. Yeah.
[13:44] Um, I, I think
[13:53] this is a sneaky move, um, by the regulators to try to suggest that nothing,
[13:53] no kind of crypto tokens or
[14:01] crypto assets can be money unless they're pegged or tied or backed by, uh, a
[14:01] fiat currency. So that's,
[14:10] that's the one classification. Then you have, um, what was the second classification?
[14:15] The asset reference to asset reference tokens. And so my understanding that would be like
[14:15] a USDT that is
[14:25] backed by not just one single fiat currency, but a basket of currencies and maybe
[14:25] even non-currencies
[14:31] assets like gold or treasuries, things like that. Um, so those are asset referenced. And
[14:31] the other third
[14:39] category is utility tokens, which, um, I've heard is Bitcoin is included in that. Um,
[14:39] I would guess
[14:46] that dash is included in that. Um, do you know, have you engaged with any
[14:46] lawyers yet to just, uh, clarify
[14:56] that dash is, or is not in that category, or is this just, uh, your
[14:56] estimation? That's my estimation.
[15:04] Okay. Uh, that, that would, it would make sense. That would be like one of
[15:04] the questions we would
[15:08] really want answered, right? Not only for crowd notes sake, but for all our sake,
[15:08] uh, in, in this community.
[15:15] Um, so, so that would be an obvious one, not only just to, to get
[15:15] a, an opinionated answer on, but
[15:21] possibly even something in writing that we can use going forward. Um, yep. Okay. Um,
[15:21] my second question
[15:31] then, uh, moving, moving on to, let's see, I mean, let me bring us back
[15:31] here. Um, in from the proposal
[15:39] text, actually, let me, uh, let me bring back the proposal. Um, so the documentation
[15:39] have, have this,
[15:54] has this been written, uh, at all, are these all things, the documentation, the technical
[15:54] changes,
[16:00] the, the legal work and the reports, is this all stuff that needs to be
[16:00] done in the future? Or has
[16:05] any of this stuff been done, uh, yet? So, you know, we've been around for
[16:05] six, seven years. We have a lot
[16:15] of good processes in place. Um, a lot is described in PowerPoints and I'm fairly
[16:15] sure, whatever I feel
[16:23] we have, it's not gonna be what the, you know, the Danish FSA is looking
[16:23] for, uh, in, in the formats
[16:29] we have them today. Uh, so, so I'm pretty sure we need to write up
[16:29] something that's more detailed,
[16:35] more. What do I know word heavy, um, than, than what's practically implemented and also
[16:35] practically
[16:42] automated for, for a great part of our platform. Um, what we don't have is
[16:42] sort of, uh, uh, a detailed
[16:50] risk assessment, um, and a risk methods model, uh, you know, and that's particularly important
[16:50] for,
[16:58] for the element of, um, AML need to do cook or not cook, right? Um,
[16:58] so we really need to elaborate on
[17:06] that. Uh, that's, that's one of the things that, that I, that I've learned the
[17:06] past couple of months.
[17:11] That's, that's probably the most important part of everything, uh, to be honest. Okay. And
[17:11] that's
[17:17] because it's, it, you know, if you, if, if you try to search through the,
[17:17] uh, the, the Mika documents,
[17:23] there's practically no reference of, uh, KYC or AML because that's governed by a totally
[17:23] different
[17:29] regulation set. Right. Um, so, so, so, so, so it's, that's why it's, it's also
[17:29] relevant to say,
[17:36] well, Mika change whether, if we have to do AML, KYC of our customers or
[17:36] not, no, it doesn't change.
[17:44] It hasn't changed anything for the past three years, but the overall awareness level on
[17:44] who we are,
[17:51] crowd note, uh, when we do then apply for a license might, you know, call
[17:51] for some extra attention
[17:58] that need, that needs us to be, you know, extra sharp on, on, uh, the
[17:58] risk assessments and, and, uh,
[18:04] and indeed also coming to the technical things we might, uh, need to do, uh,
[18:04] as well.
[18:10] Yeah. That actually hits on another, one of those questions that I have, um, there,
[18:10] there is what I can,
[18:19] from what I've discovered, there are two major things going on in Europe with regards
[18:19] to your, uh,
[18:26] regulation right now. There is, there's Mika. And my understanding of Mika is that it's,
[18:31] it's more of trying to get crypto asset businesses registered. Uh, like you said, it's,
[18:31] it's not
[18:39] dealing with KYC, but there's another separate piece of regulation that seems to be happening
[18:39] in parallel,
[18:46] although they're very separate. And this is, um, regulation regarding the fat F, uh,
[18:56] I'm trying to remember what this, uh, stands for. Financial action task force.
[19:03] So that's actually, I think it was a French initiative, uh, that's actually, you know,
[19:03] decades old,
[19:10] uh, well, at least 10 years old. Right. Uh, but, but what they started to
[19:10] do was seen as, as, um, uh,
[19:17] as, as, as, you know, trying to regulate, um, a lot, uh, some of it
[19:17] basically went into what's,
[19:26] what's today known as the, uh, AMLD. Um, so, so the director for any money
[19:26] laundering, um, and there,
[19:35] there's been like, I think it went into it in the third or fourth edition
[19:35] of it. And we have the
[19:40] sixth edition that sort of being, being rolled out, um, or is, is in effect
[19:40] now basically.
[19:48] Yeah. And this is, this is definitely something that is, is very, uh, KYC heavy,
[19:48] uh, anti Monday,
[19:56] money laundering, all the, the, you know, terrorist financing regulations, know your customer information
[20:03] required. So this is the one that's definitely scarier. Um, absolutely. I'm more afraid of
[20:03] that
[20:09] one than, than Mika, honestly. Yeah. So my, my question regarding that is it, it
[20:09] does seem to be
[20:17] that, that this is happening, even though this is, this is like, uh, uh, it's
[20:17] not a European union
[20:25] regulation. It's like a multinational, um, thing that is very extra. Um, yeah, it's,
[20:37] it's, it's something that's, I guess you said is, was started by the French, but
[20:37] it's an international
[20:42] organization that, that basically is, is not, um, spearheaded or, or officially, uh, official from
[20:42] any
[20:52] specific country. Um, but it does seem like Europe is going to pass this thing.
[20:52] So if that does pass and
[21:01] these KYC regulations come into force, um, even though it doesn't have anything to do
[21:01] with Mika,
[21:07] will Crowdnode be obligated to follow those rules? And if so, does it, does it
[21:07] make sense to get a Mika
[21:17] license if the intent is to, um, try to remain KYC free? So a lot
[21:17] of questions kind of wrapped up in
[21:27] there. Yeah. What what's Crowdnode's essentially what's Crowdnode's commitment to not requiring KYC?
[21:33] Um, and does it make sense to, to get the Mika license if this seems
[21:33] inevitable that KYC will be
[21:44] required? So good questions. Multifaceted answer is obviously called for here. So the, the, uh,
[21:44] um,
[21:55] the FAFT recommendations, uh, were actually incorporated in most European anti-money laundering
[22:00] laws back in 2005 already. So, so it's, it's out there, Ryan. It's not, if
[22:00] this is past it, those are
[22:09] past, right. And we, we opened a business in 2018, started building in 2017. And
[22:09] during 18, we had a long,
[22:18] um, basically we waited for the Danish FSA to reply back to us, whether if
[22:18] by their standards and their
[22:26] understanding of what we did, uh, and I know we'll get into that exchange or
[22:26] single address principle,
[22:33] whether if there was an AML risk in what we did and, and, um, the,
[22:33] uh, reply we got was there doesn't seem
[22:42] to be a risk. So in other words, you cannot, um, take, uh, you know,
[22:42] custody of people's, uh, passport identities
[22:53] and all that, cause that would, uh, in the, in another, uh, directive was the
[22:53] GDPR regulative, right? Um, so the data
[23:01] protection sort of booted our option for doing it, but we launched with KYC. If,
[23:01] if you remember, uh,
[23:08] or at least some in community might remember that, that they had to spend time
[23:08] on doing that. But when
[23:13] we got that reply from the Danish FSA in 18, we removed that cause that
[23:13] was then by accident, something
[23:21] we weren't allowed to keep minimum information, uh, standards would, would then apply. Um, lots
[23:21] has
[23:27] happened since 18. Um, but, but, but, you know, we haven't been, been, you know,
[23:27] dragged through the
[23:35] machinery and there is a risk, obviously there is a risk that we will be,
[23:35] uh, be to some extent forced
[23:41] into doing something else. Uh, and that else would be maybe KYC on custodial or
[23:41] maybe evolve into a
[23:49] completely non-custodial business, you know, um, so, so I don't see as a European company,
[23:49] there's a choice
[23:58] of doing what I know, voluntary KYC for EU citizens only stuff like that. But,
[23:58] but, uh, but I strongly
[24:07] believe that with the right, very strict, you know, blockchain on chain governance, that, that
[24:07] it's easy to
[24:18] justify at least in my mind that there is no AML risk, but, you know,
[24:18] whomever might sit across the
[24:25] desk from me in the Danish FSA might argue that, um, that, that they have
[24:25] a different view on it. Um,
[24:31] but, uh, so will we be forced potentially? Yes. Is it a risk? Yes. Do
[24:31] I believe that we will be able to
[24:40] successfully run proud note without KYC afterwards? Cause there is no risk. I also believe
[24:40] that, but, but
[24:46] that's sort of the paradox, um, that, that we're navigating right now. And we, we
[24:46] won't know for
[24:51] sure unless we test it out and actually, uh, you know, take the dialogue with
[24:51] the Danish FSA, uh, steps
[24:58] further. Um, but we need to have our documentation in order before we, we do
[24:58] that. Okay. Um, quick
[25:06] question on the, the cost of the proposal. What, what is the cost going towards?
[25:06] Is this going towards,
[25:14] um, the, the, you know, the 255 dash for two months, is this going towards
[25:14] lawyers? Uh, is it,
[25:21] is there a specific fee that's required by, um, to, to get them, the Mika
[25:21] license? Is there any actual
[25:31] fee to get, just to get the Mika license or is it strictly lawyers, um,
[25:31] crowd node, uh, staff writing?
[25:39] Not even crowd node staff. So it's, it's purely lawyers and auditors. So, so basically
[25:39] what we need
[25:45] to have someone that's not us, um, verify and, and vet, um, I'm, I'm not
[25:45] even sure that there will be a,
[25:53] a, a, you know, small, um, fee for, for, you know, pushing the application towards
[25:53] the Danish FSA. I
[26:03] haven't, I haven't heard that, uh, there might be, but that's, that's minor. No. So
[26:03] it's, it's strictly
[26:08] the external costs that, that will, uh, incur, um, by, by getting a lawyer to
[26:08] sort of, you know, look at
[26:16] the policies, look at the risk modeling, uh, the risk governance, the compliance things we,
[26:16] we put in
[26:24] writing and say if it's good enough or not good enough. Um, I would love
[26:24] for them to also provide
[26:30] better versions if, if that's possible, but that's also likely to, to be more expensive.
[26:30] Right. Um,
[26:37] and then we need some good, uh, cryptocurrency auditors, um, that are not affiliated with
[26:37] the
[26:44] lawyer either that comes in and provides, you know, oversight into, if we write that
[26:44] we're doing it in a
[26:51] a certain way in the lawyers at tests that it's, uh, compliance, uh, you know,
[26:51] following Mika standards.
[26:59] And then, uh, the verification also, uh, uh, is, is taken care of by, by
[26:59] an auditor that we're actually
[27:05] doing like we, we are writing, we're doing right. So, so, so that's basically what
[27:05] we intend on, on,
[27:13] on using the funds for, um, yeah. So, so what does it mean to actually
[27:13] be compliant to Mika?
[27:22] Yeah. Do we know that? Do we know what it means? First of all, let
[27:22] me ask, have you read the,
[27:28] I think it's like 300 or, or maybe even up to a thousand, I saw
[27:28] pages long, some versions. Have
[27:36] you read the actual Mika license, uh, regulation? I've, I've read, uh, there's, uh, I
[27:36] think it's,
[27:44] it's, uh, referred to as a distilled version of, uh, 170 some pages. I've read
[27:44] that one. Um,
[27:51] and, uh, uh, uh, uh, in all honesty, I didn't like slow read it. I,
[27:51] I skimmed it. Right. Cause there's
[27:58] so much stuff I don't really understand anyways. Um, so for a lot of my
[27:58] knowledge, I, I'm obviously,
[28:04] uh, chat GBT and Googling and, uh, asking friends, right. Yeah. But it's the beast
[28:04] to get it from,
[28:11] from me to see, but it's also a wonderful beast. Cause I see a lot
[28:11] of things that are, um,
[28:17] um, not a necessarily a bad thing for, for us as a small, uh, non-significant,
[28:17] uh, player.
[28:26] Yeah. I'm just, I'm just, I, I'm panning through some of the first pages just
[28:26] to give people, uh,
[28:35] that are watching the video version, uh, an idea of what this looks like. Yeah.
[28:35] I think that this is
[28:42] the actual document from what I could tell. And as you can see, you know,
[28:42] it's, it's, it's many pages.
[28:49] Um, let me just skip down to the bottom. Um, 380 pages on this version,
[28:49] at least. Um, I did,
[29:01] I, I watched some videos related to this stuff. I want to read two statements
[29:01] that, um, that the
[29:11] researchers over at Coin Bureau picked up and see, get your comments on those. Um,
[29:11] and just bring up my
[29:20] notes. So first thing that was text taken out of this document, I believe, and
[29:20] I could probably do a
[29:29] find, uh, to see if it's actually comes up. Um, but it says where crypto
[29:29] asset services are, as defined in
[29:38] this regulation are provided in a fully decentralized manner without any inter intermediary, they do
[29:38] not
[29:45] fall within the scope of this regulation. And that's interesting because it says where crypto
[29:45] asset
[29:53] services are defined in this regulation. Um, so I would understand my, my overall understanding
[29:53] of, of Mika
[30:01] is that they are not trying to go after DeFi. They're explicitly not trying to
[30:01] regulate any kind of
[30:07] DeFi meaning the fully automated smart contract based, um, services. And they're not trying to
[30:07] regulate that.
[30:17] That's what this sentence might say, but it also says, um, crypto asset services. Um,
[30:17] so do you have
[30:26] anything, does that strike you as interesting or, or not? Yeah, very much so. Cause
[30:26] what it actually says,
[30:32] is, uh, is, uh, is, is, is to, to whatever extent something is fully decentralized
[30:32] and done in a trustless
[30:40] manner. Um, uh, and there's also other sentences, like if it's done in a consensus
[30:40] mechanism of, uh, um,
[30:49] of, uh, rewarding, uh, participants of a coin or an asset, um, then it's not
[30:49] in scope for Mika.
[30:56] So, so it's actually a really important statement where, where we haven't seen anything anywhere
[30:56] in
[31:03] the world and that, that basically addresses, uh, that there is something that's known as
[31:03] decentralized
[31:10] finance when it's fully decentralized trustless, not scope for Mika. That's really interesting.
[31:16] Cause that, that, that opens up for, for a lot of good possibilities, uh, for
[31:16] dash it, it's, it's, uh,
[31:24] you have to balance things because dash is also considered a privacy coin. So, so,
[31:24] but again, Mika
[31:30] and dash, I, I don't, I'm not seeing any reason why we should as a
[31:30] dash community fear Mika, uh, at least,
[31:39] but, um, but it also tells me that, that if crowd node, uh, if we
[31:39] build, um, on top of the trustless
[31:47] solution we have now, which is, you know, initially not a trustless solution. Uh, but
[31:47] if we truly build
[31:54] a hundred percent non-custodial way to do what we're doing today, then, and only do
[31:54] that, by the way,
[32:02] then we're good. Then it's irrelevant for us to have a Mika license.
[32:05] Yes. Which would mean we would, you wouldn't have to get it, but the current
[32:05] state of crowd
[32:10] node is that it is a cent is, it is a centralized with intermediaries service.
[32:10] So currently you do
[32:18] need to get the license. Um, I'm just wondering what would be required. And you
[32:18] and I have talked
[32:25] about this before, what kind of technical changes could crowd node make in order to
[32:25] fit within this,
[32:32] uh, this carve out, uh, that so that you're not really, um, required to do
[32:32] Mika at all.
[32:42] Yeah. So, so in all honesty, I can only see that we can achieve the
[32:42] completely non-trustless manner
[32:48] in the current setup. Right. Um, I, I have, I've, I've obviously, uh, crowd node
[32:48] as a company, I would love
[32:56] for crowd node eventually to make some money, but there's all obviously, uh, an element
[32:56] to, to how to
[33:02] decentralize this, um, Ash had, uh, an idea, uh, on whether if we've, you know,
[33:02] put some thought into
[33:11] it and it's been a topic going around the Dow for several years to build
[33:11] something that's, that's basically
[33:17] dash native, um, you know, part of, um, part of the ecosystem by default, um,
[33:17] and not something that,
[33:27] that that's, that I needed service. Um, so if the core team decides to build,
[33:27] what do I know something
[33:34] master node shares, we would, uh, obviously, uh, look at something that is decentralized, uh,
[33:34] and if we
[33:42] can also do it trustlessly, then we can be the matchmaking service of that and
[33:42] have the nodes ready.
[33:47] Um, but as, as crowd node as a, as a service, I think that we
[33:47] can only hit the hammer as a company
[33:54] on, on the trustless path, uh, and we would need help to, to also achieve
[33:54] the decentralization
[34:01] aspects of it. Right. Now the, the trustless side, is it possible technically to not
[34:01] re to not have to
[34:09] receive any kind of funds to not have crowd node to have to receive any
[34:09] kind of funds, uh, for the
[34:18] trustless side? Uh, because currently my understanding is that you do actually have to send
[34:18] in your funds
[34:23] to crowd node, even if you're doing trustless. Can you tell us more about that?
[34:23] Yeah. Uh, and, uh,
[34:31] we did this implementation because it's by far, uh, the simple, um, there was a,
[34:31] uh,
[34:41] a lot of theoretic, uh, deadlock risks, um, that can be mitigated, um, in a
[34:41] 100% non-custodial setup.
[34:54] Um, but it's not going to be very user friendly unless we have wallet integrations
[34:54] handling, uh,
[35:02] everything. So Ryan, let's say you have a hundred dash and I have 900 dash,
[35:02] uh, you know, sending
[35:08] that into crowd node. There's a thousand. There we go. All we need to then
[35:08] worry about is the refund
[35:15] signatures. Um, but if we keep them in our own wallets, uh, while we're doing
[35:15] not only the signatures
[35:25] of actually pro tx funding, a new master node, subsequently, uh, the refunding, um, you've
[35:25] spent,
[35:33] you know, much more time on signing. And what if you spent your 100 dash
[35:33] that's sitting there in,
[35:38] in the UTXO, uh, meanwhile, I mean, we have to restart everything. So building, uh,
[35:38] you know,
[35:44] integrations into wallets that's, that are able to then sort of lock funds, lock transactions,
[35:50] like we're seeing court doing today when there's a thousand or 4,000 in collateral, um,
[35:50] and, and
[35:56] helping to, to sign, uh, to sort of smoothen the, the user experience, um, that,
[35:56] uh, that I think is,
[36:03] is, is needed. Uh, but yeah, there is a way, uh, it's, it's probably, uh,
[36:03] two to three times, uh,
[36:09] more complex than, than the setup we have today, but it's, it's possible. It's doable.
[36:09] Um, uh, but,
[36:16] but I, I personally don't think it's doable without automations also on the, on the
[36:16] wallet side of
[36:22] things. Um, too few people would, would be able to do it. Uh, and, uh,
[36:22] and yeah, looking at the
[36:29] adoption today, uh, of trustless, uh, it's complex enough as it is, right? Yeah. I,
[36:29] I fully agree that
[36:36] the only way to make it feasible would be to automate the whole process, the
[36:36] whole signing process. You'd
[36:41] have to have integrations with wallets. Um, that's something that, um, you know, to, to
[36:41] bring this into the
[36:47] incubator a little bit. We, we do have JavaScript versions of wallets that we have
[36:47] tried to make,
[36:56] we could make automated in that sense. Um, but this is, these are technical questions
[36:56] that would come
[37:04] further down the road, I think. And let me read this other statement real quick.
[37:04] Um, so it says in order
[37:10] to ensure a proportionate approach, no requirements of this regulation should apply to the offering
[37:10] of
[37:16] crypto assets, other than asset reference tokens or money e-money tokens that are offered for
[37:16] free,
[37:22] that are automatically created as a reward for the maintenance of the DLT or the
[37:22] validation of
[37:27] transactions in the context of a consensus mechanism. Yes. Do you have anything to say
[37:27] about this? My
[37:33] understanding of this is that, um, and this is actually, uh, a little bit of
[37:33] a, a revision from
[37:40] the version that I heard. They didn't have this, um, exemption for crypto assets and
[37:40] crypto reference
[37:47] tokens, but, uh, Dash would neither would be neither of those I, I believe. But
[37:47] to me, this kind of says that,
[37:56] um, it's not trying to regulate cryptocurrencies where the issuance is, is basically automatically
[38:04] done through the consensus mechanism for validating transactions. So that would probably be, uh, your,
[38:12] your typical proof of work that, uh, Dash technically is. What, what do you have
[38:12] to say about this? Does this
[38:19] help our case at all? Yeah, I think it does. I mean, I actually just,
[38:19] I think what you're looking at
[38:26] is a year old, uh, they revised the statement a little bit. Um, but, but
[38:26] the, the sounding is still
[38:32] the same, you know, maintenance of distributed layers, uh, or validation of transactions in a,
[38:32] in a concept,
[38:39] uh, consensus mechanism thing is, is, is still there and it's really relevant for Dash
[38:39] at least. Uh, but,
[38:46] you know, adding a, us as a service provider, we're distributing that reward. Um, and,
[38:46] um, and that,
[38:55] that might actually make things a little bit more complex for us, uh, but that's
[38:55] something we need
[39:00] to look at. Um, uh, but, uh, but the good fellows, uh, from the Danish
[39:00] FSA pointed us to, we need to,
[39:07] there's some, there's a concept of what's called alternative investment funds, uh, in Denmark, uh,
[39:13] which basically calls for us to be listed, uh, if we fall under those, those
[39:13] categories,
[39:19] the regulatory requirements at the paradox here is they are not worse for an alternative
[39:19] investment
[39:25] fund, but you actually get a benefit of being listed, especially if, if you also
[39:25] prove compliance.
[39:31] Um, so, so, uh, but at least, you know, we're not in, in, I, I
[39:31] think, uh, in a bad place, uh, cause what
[39:41] we're seeing here from a Dash perspective is funds generated as rewards, um, for a
[39:41] consensus mechanism.
[39:50] Although you, you're absolutely right to argue, is it a proof of work? You could
[39:50] say instant sense,
[39:56] it's a proof of service, right? And we're unique in that sense. So we probably
[39:56] need to educate what's
[40:02] the difference between proof of work, which is what the miners are doing, um, on,
[40:02] on the Dash chain,
[40:08] uh, minting new blocks and the instant sense validations that the master node, the master
[40:08] nodes
[40:15] are doing, uh, they, they still means to the, to the same end goal, right?
[40:15] But, but it's, it's different
[40:21] mechanisms that, that, that makes them, uh, tick. Um, but for the sake of the
[40:21] argument, it's, it would
[40:28] be simple to say that we are still some, some lot of proof of work,
[40:28] um, and, and, and in that sense,
[40:35] in this, in scope of this. Okay. Um, but I don't think it changes anything
[40:35] for crowd node. I think we
[40:40] still need, need to have a license. Uh, I don't think we can add a
[40:40] service on top of a distribution
[40:46] happening on chain and then, Hey Mary, we don't need to do anything. Mm-hmm. Okay.
[40:46] Um,
[40:53] I'm going to go back to my screen share. Uh, just, I wanted to, to
[40:53] bring this up real quick. Uh, people
[40:59] can read through this, this, um, this was just, this was a while ago. This
[40:59] is just referencing two,
[41:06] two reports, the, the Mika and the, uh, the one that we discussed as well,
[41:06] which was the, the fat F's
[41:14] identity, um, identity of those making crypto payments. So this is the KYC fat F
[41:14] version, uh,
[41:22] regulation, which, uh, I believe is, is this one right here. This is the one
[41:22] that would require, um,
[41:29] KYC for all sorts of things. And I'm personally concerned about, because I don't think
[41:29] that,
[41:39] I personally don't think that most of crowd nodes, uh, users are interested in doing
[41:39] KYC. I could be
[41:45] wrong. Um, but, uh, I also wanted to play a short one or two minute
[41:45] clip of, of this guy talking about
[41:55] something similar and get your, get your thoughts on this. So let's see my sharing
[41:55] my screen yet. Yeah.
[42:01] Okay. I see it at least. Can't hear him though. Let me back him up
[42:01] a bit. I'm not hearing anything.
[42:09] Do you hear it? Nope. You don't hear it. I don't hear it. I see
[42:09] him. Oh, okay. Um, hmm. Interesting. Well, um,
[42:26] I think we'll skip that then that was, I was basically just going to, he
[42:26] was, he was just
[42:31] going to talk about how these two different regulations are, are coming in at the
[42:31] same time,
[42:37] essentially. Um, and my concern with that is just overarching concern is, is should we,
[42:44] should we be trying to become a fully decentralized, uh, service? Should crowd node try
[42:44] to become a fully
[42:51] decentralized service or should crowd node try to get, um, this Mika license? Because it
[42:51] seems like
[42:58] these are two paths that, uh, they, they part ways and they're mutually exclusive and
[42:58] crowd node could
[43:04] choose one or the other. If crowd nodes fully decentralized, um, then we don't need
[43:04] to get the
[43:10] Mika license. It's essentially software. Um, and we, if that's the case, then we don't
[43:10] need to do KYC.
[43:18] Um, but if we do go with the Mika approach, then, you know, is it,
[43:18] is it money wasted? Essentially,
[43:27] if you end up going with Mika pot, doing the Mika, uh, regulation, and then
[43:27] also doing the decentralized
[43:35] version, is that money wasted on the lawyers? I'd rather see that money going to
[43:35] crowd node engineers
[43:42] personally to build the decentralized version. So there's a lot of layers to it, honestly.
[43:42] Um,
[43:49] and I, I, I follow you completely. Uh, I'm in tech, uh, I'm an engineer,
[43:49] you know, should we spend money on
[43:58] what's none tech where it might seem as the project is not moving forward? There's
[43:58] crowd node at all. Um,
[44:06] uh, or will we eventually have a dial that is strong enough. So that be
[44:06] the one extreme or have a dial that's
[44:15] strong enough to actually influence, um, what's going on or, um, partake on in good
[44:15] discussions and trying to,
[44:24] to, um, to be, uh, out there for.
[44:29] What's essentially the purpose of Mika and the purpose of Mika and EU is, is
[44:29] really about,
[44:36] you know, showing good, uh, conduct of operating a crypto business or operating a crypto
[44:36] or a token or
[44:43] whatever. Uh, it's there to, to, um, basically protect the users. Um, it's in place
[44:43] to prevent market abuse.
[44:53] Uh, that's, that's all the, at least political or ideological ideas behind Mika itself.
[45:00] Um, and, and, and I really cannot see myself against that in any way. Um,
[45:00] and, uh, not passing
[45:09] on any judgment to, to anyone in the community for being against that and feeling
[45:09] that that might be
[45:15] an overreach, but for what it's worth, it's, it's, it's actually really good. Uh, and,
[45:15] and, and Mika
[45:21] is now, uh, I've heard that on at least, uh, two occasions being referenced as
[45:21] the future gold
[45:26] standard of how to operate, uh, crypto, um, asset services. Um, and that's because again,
[45:26] Mika is
[45:35] not AML KYC. Mika is, is simply there to, um, ensure. But, but Mika might
[45:35] be coupled with something.
[45:43] Yes. Mika. Concern. Exactly. It might be coupled with it, but you know, let me
[45:43] do last week. I
[45:51] went to a conference here in Denmark called, um, uh, tech barbecue. So it's probably
[45:51] the startup, uh,
[45:58] conference in, in, uh, in Copenhagen, possibly even in Scandinavia and Chelsea Manning was there.
[45:58] Uh,
[46:04] and she, and she had a good point that, um, if there's no trust in
[46:04] that, we can normalize these
[46:09] institutions, uh, if we participate and institutions basically mean, meaning, uh, the Danish FSA, uh,
[46:17] in this case for us, at least, then we're really in a, in a bad
[46:17] place in terms of a sort of democratic
[46:23] backslide and paraphrasing what she said. Right. And, and the Danish, uh, FSA, they're really
[46:30] approachable. You know, we've written mails with them. We've talked with them on the phone
[46:30] and they're
[46:36] not like, oh, it's like, okay, so we need to write policies and you, and
[46:36] here's a guideline for that. And
[46:42] you need a, this and that audited. And here's the guideline for that. So they're
[46:42] really forthcoming.
[46:48] They're not just saying that that's my, that's never gonna happen. They're really engaging in
[46:48] dialogue.
[46:53] And if, if what we're doing is just to show an even better good conduct
[46:53] than what Crowdnode is
[47:00] doing already. And I think we have a lot of good, good standards, um, already.
[47:00] Um, and if we can then
[47:07] also, you know, share a good, uh, risk assessment and, and, and show a lot
[47:07] of good things, then I, I cannot see
[47:16] that's money spent badly in any sense. Um, and at least for one DFO or,
[47:16] you know, company using, uh, dash and
[47:28] being so, so sort of, uh, um, in the community, I, I would love to
[47:28] be able to present a Mika license
[47:36] because that could pave the way for other companies to get a license as well.
[47:36] You know, then, then at
[47:41] at least we know it's not dash, um, and it's not Crowdnode cause they have
[47:41] a license and it's on dash.
[47:48] Then it's the concept of whatever, uh, other asset service providers would be doing with
[47:48] dash,
[47:53] but at least it opens the gates towards, you know, different other services on dash
[47:53] within EU.
[48:00] I think that that's, that's, that can only be positive. Um, but playing along with
[48:00] it, what if
[48:06] we don't get it, will it then be money? You know, that that's, you know,
[48:06] hands down, that's a fair
[48:11] argument. Uh, it might be except for what we would have done in terms of
[48:11] building an even better technical
[48:18] platform, having good policies. Uh, and like I also wrote in, in, you know, on
[48:18] the, um, on the proposal,
[48:26] then let's talk about the future for Crowdnode code base and, and whatnot. But if
[48:26] we don't try,
[48:32] we never know if dash and Crowdnode will ever fly within EU. Uh, and I
[48:32] think we have to try.
[48:41] Okay. A couple of things about that. So
[48:46] I'd like to get your idea, your, your most likely outcome. Let's just assume that
[48:46] it does, this
[48:55] proposal does not pass. If we assume that as a, as a given, what does
[48:55] the future look like for Crowdnode?
[49:03] Does, do you have to close up shop immediately, uh, on December 30th or December
[49:03] 31st or whatever the date
[49:12] was on 2020, 2024? Um, is there a, can you tell me more about that
[49:12] grace period? Um, would you have
[49:21] the grace period? Um, or do you have to completely shut down shop? So the
[49:21] grandfather clause with the 18
[49:32] months, uh, has, I love that for a couple of practical purposes, right? Um,
[49:38] I don't see Crowdnode continue in its form after the 18 months without either being
[49:38] completely non-custodial,
[49:50] the trustless, uh, the trustless, uh, version 2.0. Um, starting from December of 2024. So
[49:50] essentially
[50:00] we have to be in process, uh, on, on, you know, in dialogue, uh, possibly
[50:00] even send an application,
[50:08] have some meetings, writing their different, uh, policies, um, and, and doing internal controls
[50:17] by that point in time, uh, it, you know, not sit on our hands and
[50:17] pretend like nothing's happening.
[50:25] You know, we have to start doing something, but obviously we work hard on spending
[50:25] money on lawyers
[50:30] and external auditors because we, we wouldn't have the money for that. And, but we'll
[50:30] see how,
[50:34] how far we can then get by, by doing internal controls. And, and, um, and
[50:34] then, you, you know,
[50:42] one interesting aspect with being on, on Joel's podcast or the Dash podcast the other
[50:42] day was,
[50:48] was, you know, um, talking about Crowdnode fees. We've sort of insisted on keeping them
[50:48] at,
[50:55] at 15%, um, which when we launched, uh, six years ago, correlated with a Dash
[50:55] price of around $1,500.
[51:07] right. But now we're down to 20 ish. Right. And we're still at 15%. Uh,
[51:07] but we insisted on keeping
[51:14] it at that level, possibly because we're idiots. Uh, can't argue against that. Uh,
[51:19] this disillusionated possibly even also, but hoping for Dash to sort of, uh, bounce back
[51:19] on the charts,
[51:26] uh, back in the top 50. Right. Um, and then I have a small hope
[51:26] that platform kicks off nicely.
[51:36] Uh, it builds traction for Dash. Uh, we maybe, uh, you know, double our fees,
[51:36] uh, and then
[51:44] maybe we can fund it within the 18 months of the grandfathering clause. But what
[51:44] if we can't, right?
[51:54] You tell me.
[51:56] Yeah. Okay. One, one, uh, other thing that I saw that you had said to
[51:56] either pasta or somebody else
[52:07] that was commenting on the proposal. And let me just go back to the proposal
[52:07] and, and scroll through
[52:12] the comments section as well. So people can see that. Um, uh, is it the
[52:12] case that I, I think that you've
[52:22] mentioned, and I, again, I don't know where exactly, but you, you basically said if
[52:22] we don't get the Mika
[52:28] license, then it's essentially shutting Europeans out of the Dash market. Um, I did also
[52:28] see something
[52:37] that was related to that idea in my research and it had to do with,
[52:37] uh, again, my audio, my audio is
[52:46] not connected, so I can't play the video, but I'll probably put it in the
[52:46] show notes. Um, it has to do
[52:52] with this so-called reverse solicitation exemption. And my understanding of what that was is that
[52:52] even
[52:59] if a company, let's say outside of Europe, you, you can't operate a company in
[52:59] Europe without a Mika
[53:06] license, a crypto company like flat out. Right. But if somebody else, uh, operated Crowdnode,
[53:06] uh, or you
[53:14] operated it from a different country, I don't know if that's possible, uh, incorporated in
[53:14] a different
[53:18] country, um, even outside of Europe. My understanding is that people can still take, uh,
[53:18] Europeans can still
[53:30] take advantage of any service that is provided, um, by somebody that's outside of the,
[53:30] of the country
[53:39] through this clause, through this reverse solicitation exemption, which basically means,
[53:44] you know, let's say a U S company is, uh, has a service like Crowdnode,
[53:44] um, and they, they're not
[53:51] soliciting, uh, EU members for their clients, but EU members still could take advantage of
[53:51] that service
[54:00] as long as they're not solicited. Um, so they, they basically have to say, Hey,
[54:00] I want this service.
[54:07] Um, and do you know anything about this exemption? Yeah. So, um, I think it's
[54:07] highly speculative and
[54:13] it's going to be very hard to prove that, that you're really not marketing in
[54:13] any sort of direction
[54:18] towards EU for the sake of the thought experiment that, uh, uh, someone would operate
[54:18] a service that
[54:27] resembles Crowdnode from, from U S the U S right. Um, you know, proving that
[54:27] is, uh, uh, in reality, I don't
[54:36] think that will be possible, uh, for Crowdnode sake. Well, we're a registered trademark in
[54:36] EU, right? We that's,
[54:44] we can't do that. Right. We, we, it's too late. Um, and, and for, for,
[54:44] you can't re-register from a
[54:51] different country. No, we wouldn't be able to do that with the same IP and
[54:51] then pretend that we're
[54:56] not. I don't know how these legal things work. I just know that there's a
[54:56] lot of American companies
[55:02] that operate out of Ireland, for example, and they get all sorts of benefits for
[55:02] that. So I, I'm just,
[55:07] I'm more of a tech guy than. Yeah. And you could argue, you know, why
[55:07] not just, you know,
[55:13] move the company to Malta or Switzerland and, and see if we can get something
[55:13] going there ahead of
[55:18] time. Uh, and, and again, I feel that's, that's either, uh, a duck and cover,
[55:18] uh, idea or, um,
[55:26] you know, it doesn't seem right. I'm, I'm a Danish guy. I live in Denmark.
[55:26] I have a Danish company,
[55:32] you know, the Danish FSA seems to be, uh, you know, good to talk with
[55:32] guy guiding us and not giving us any form of,
[55:41] you know, signals that this is, um, this is the end. Right. Um, but, but
[55:41] they do have some requirements
[55:48] towards us. Um, and, and, and by the way, even, even this, um, reverse solicitation,
[55:48] that's even,
[55:56] even more unknown land, uh, than I think the entire mega aspect is at least
[55:56] a lot, a couple of FSAs,
[56:03] uh, in every member states, uh, have an idea on how to, you know, proceed
[56:03] with, uh, these applications
[56:11] and stuff like that. And then actually seeing the application of the regulatory implementations
[56:17] afterwards is, is, uh, yeah, referred to as terror incognito. Right. Uh, so, so it's,
[56:17] it's very
[56:22] speculative for, for the reverse solicitation to ever have a real effect. I think you'll
[56:22] see any serious
[56:31] provider wanting to try to comply. Um, Yeah. Yeah. To be honest. Yeah. Yeah. And
[56:31] I, uh, my questions
[56:41] probably, uh, come across a little bit as like anti crowd node. I hope it
[56:41] doesn't come across that way.
[56:47] I've, I've loved the service. I love the fact that, uh, wallets can integrate with
[56:47] the crowd node API.
[56:54] We've done that in the incubator. We, we have a JavaScript library that, that integrates
[56:54] and, and
[57:00] implements the, uh, the, the on chain transaction API that you've created. I think it's,
[57:00] it's a good,
[57:09] it's a good service. My, uh, you saw, you saw my comments. We've talked about
[57:09] it. I, I just don't
[57:16] support sending a bunch of money to lawyers. Uh, I'd rather see that money going
[57:16] to crowd
[57:21] node specifically to build a fully decentralized service. I would, that's my personal preference,
[57:28] but, uh, I also want, want you to make your best case. Um, and, and
[57:28] so some of the things that I've
[57:34] said have been like, can we figure out a way to, you know, get around
[57:34] this basically is what I'm saying.
[57:41] And I'm trying to, to see if, if European members can still be served through
[57:41] this reverse, uh,
[57:47] solicitation exemption, for example, even if crowd node went away. So I'm just saying those
[57:47] things to
[57:53] see what stones have we not unturned. And is there any way that we can
[57:53] get around this? Because my
[58:01] personal main major concern is that this, uh, this proposal that we have is for
[58:01] 255 dash, uh, for two
[58:10] months, but that's just the beginning. It seems like that's less than half of what's
[58:10] going to be needed
[58:15] to even do what you already know will be required. What's your overall, um, can
[58:15] you summarize again,
[58:23] what you think the costs going forward would be, um, and is what, what would
[58:23] we get out of this proposal?
[58:31] This proposal specifically just these two payments.
[58:37] So I would definitely, uh, just, you know, try to, to highlight a very simple
[58:37] piece of math.
[58:47] If a lawyer costs 700 euros per hour, a good crypto lawyer to assess this,
[58:47] uh, and we, you know, go for
[58:56] 30,000, that's shy of 50 hours of a lawyer's time. And if let's say that
[58:56] a lawyer can maybe only do
[59:04] only need a lawyer 20 hours, and then the rest would be 30, possibly an
[59:04] auditor is a bit less expensive.
[59:12] that's maybe 40 hours of auditing by a, uh, uh, recognized, uh, crypto auditing company
[59:12] from within
[59:20] EU. That's not a lot of hours, uh, to get, you know, externals on board
[59:20] to, to help with that. And that's
[59:28] for the 30,000 euro price. Um, so, but, um, uh, Oh, sorry. So, so.
[59:40] Did you say 700 euros per hour? Yeah. That's the going rate for, for lawyers
[59:40] right now for this,
[59:49] this kind of stuff. Yes. Wouldn't you like to have that instead?
[59:52] Don't we want to pay crowd node that instead? I mean, that's a fun question.
[59:52] Um, that gets us 40
[60:02] hours, right? 30,000, $30,000 at 700 euros per hour. I mean, that's, that's 40 hours
[60:02] of somebody's
[60:09] work. That's it's, does that get us much, right? But you know, your, your, your
[60:09] question actually had
[60:15] a, uh, to, you know, it tickled me twice, right? Uh, uh, the best approach
[60:15] I think is not to sort of
[60:23] avoid the problem here, but work through it. Um, so that's one part, um, and,
[60:23] and doing the compliance
[60:29] and governance stuff and having that, that external expenditure on, on whatever we need. That's
[60:29] one side
[60:35] of things. I'm S I still think it's relevant that we look at building, uh,
[60:35] um, the 100% non-custodial
[60:45] solution on, on top of what we have today as a, as a parallel thing
[60:45] to, uh, compliance and all that help
[60:53] to write things in legalese we need, right? Uh, so it's, I don't see it
[60:53] as either or, um, I see it as,
[61:00] as something we, you know, both, right. Um, and, and I also still firmly believe
[61:00] there is a
[61:08] good and fair probability that we will be allowed not to operate without a media
[61:08] license, but to
[61:15] operate without doing KYC. Um, and, and only looking at, you know, the, you know,
[61:15] the one address,
[61:25] you know, as a member on crowd note, you always deposit from one address and
[61:25] that's the same
[61:32] address the funds go back onto. And the only difference with, of what you deposited
[61:32] to what
[61:38] you get back is the distributed rewards. And that's, that, that is something we can
[61:38] prove and an external
[61:47] auditor will be able to prove. How's that more risky than just, you know, signing
[61:47] over your private keys to
[61:54] someone else in terms of AML, right? So, so I think it's, it's a fair
[61:54] argument that I really need to
[62:00] try. Uh, and, and, um, and, you know, I can only speculate as to why
[62:00] exchanges are not, you know,
[62:08] taking this approach either, but now they're looking at, uh, instead, instead of, uh, one
[62:08] address
[62:13] principle, like I call it, they're looking at having to prove ownership of an address
[62:13] for a user, you know,
[62:20] so you can deposit from one address, but you then need to prove you own
[62:20] the address you wish, which
[62:26] to, you know, withdraw to. Why is that not just the same address? That's inarguably
[62:26] then an implicit
[62:33] proof to me that it's the same person. Um, and nobody's making that case except
[62:33] us. And I think we
[62:40] have to make that case. Um, and in terms of, you know, if, if we,
[62:40] if we then tighten the grip a little
[62:48] bit around this one address principle and also, you know, tell our members that when
[62:48] you have an address
[62:56] with crowd node, you know, don't use this address to, uh, to, uh, pay for,
[62:56] you know, basically do anything
[63:03] else. This address is only used for you to send funds into, then to crowd
[63:03] node, then back, and then
[63:11] move elsewhere again. Then within our grasp of at least one or two transactions chain
[63:11] span, there's,
[63:18] there's not going to be anything for us to see report on, or, you know,
[63:25] I can't, I can't really find the good argument for, for not getting that, but
[63:25] obviously, uh, I, I might
[63:35] be disillusioned here and, and someone presents a good argument. That's, uh, something not in
[63:35] the lines
[63:41] of government overreach, but actually explaining to me why, why that can be seen as
[63:41] a risk because I can't
[63:47] see it. Um, so, so I, I would want to build on, uh, the trustless
[63:47] and I would want to
[63:55] build on further reducing risk, um, on this based on this one address principle that
[63:55] we've had right
[64:02] from the get-go that I think still rocks in terms of the transparency it provides.
[64:02] Um,
[64:08] but, um, but yeah, there's been a lot of good comments on the, uh, on
[64:08] the proposal side, right?
[64:17] Yeah. Okay. I want to, I want to, um, mention a question for you to
[64:17] answer from Tanta Stefana.
[64:25] I will, um, post it here. Let's see if I can show it on the
[64:25] screen. I understand Mika is for European
[64:33] countries, but how does this affect people in other parts of the world who may
[64:33] want to use your services
[64:38] and how is it different from the services you're currently provide? Um, and then she
[64:38] also says
[64:46] that didn't come through with the text. She also says, what extra KYC requirements do
[64:46] you have, um,
[64:52] have you required in the past? So I think you covered that. Um, but if
[64:52] you want to say anything more about it,
[64:59] um, I think the, the palette of services will be, uh, the same for all
[64:59] of our members, regarding of,
[65:13] regardless of where you live in the world, basically. Um, I don't think that they're
[65:13] sort of going to be,
[65:21] we offer something to, uh, people who live in the U S and something to
[65:21] people who live in China and
[65:27] something to people who live elsewhere. Um, the only thing that sort of governs our
[65:27] services from rat,
[65:34] from that perspective, um, is sanctions. Right. Um, so, so, so those we need to
[65:34] be, uh, to be aware of,
[65:45] uh, and, and make sure we, we also, we, we follow and how can we
[65:45] follow sanctions if we're not,
[65:51] you know, at least registering where people are, uh, coming from country rise. Um, so
[65:51] that,
[65:56] that's a paradoxical thing. And what extra KYC do we then need to require? Uh,
[65:56] hopefully none because
[66:04] there will be found a zero risk. Um, but, um, there is, there is a
[66:04] risk that at least for the custodial
[66:11] part of what we're doing, we, we, we will, we will have to re-implement or
[66:11] reactivate the KYC part. Um,
[66:20] but there's a chance that we won't have to, um, but then again, mostly on
[66:20] the, the, the financial
[66:28] action, action task force regulations. Yes. Exactly. But what if we built the 100% non-custodial
[66:28] and make
[66:36] that, uh, you know, blockchain API wise easy or at least, uh, possible for, for,
[66:36] yeah, let's say you guys,
[66:44] the incubators, uh, to, to build, um, a easy wallet integration on, um,
[66:52] you know, then it's never in our custody. And one of the requirements, uh, related
[66:52] to all of this,
[67:00] uh, both AML, uh, KYC, um, one of the, the articles that activates that you
[67:00] need to be compliant is that
[67:08] it's, it's a custodial. So if we can remove the custodial aspect, we're, we'll be
[67:08] in a much better
[67:13] place. That's for sure. So that's how it will be different. Uh, just to touch
[67:13] on Tante Stefana's
[67:19] question. Um, if we, um, if we then start to build, and I think I
[67:19] showed a roadmap, um, on, uh, on Joel's
[67:27] part on the dash podcast, right. That, that I think we should, we should, you
[67:27] know, have that, uh, Q1 next
[67:33] year, if not even sooner, but that requires you to maybe chip in and say,
[67:33] you want to build the other
[67:41] end of it or, uh, the mobile team, uh, or, um, Electrum or into call
[67:41] even a quick question on,
[67:55] do you, do you actually do the, the hosting, uh, and operating of the nodes
[67:55] and crowd node, or do you
[68:01] outsource that? We outsource that. Uh, so we have, uh, sit and all notes. Okay.
[68:01] Um, one time has a
[68:09] question. He says, how many months of 255 dash funding will be needed for Mika
[68:09] ever in the future?
[68:15] Ever in the future. That's a good question. I think he just means like how
[68:15] much more funding beyond this
[68:25] 255, two payments of 255, we've talked about it a little bit. I don't think
[68:25] it's known, but I'm just
[68:32] asking the questions so that, um, you can answer however you'd like. Yeah. Yeah. So,
[68:32] so, um,
[68:39] I'm leaning very much on what Satri told me in Amsterdam. Um, and, uh, that
[68:39] doesn't mean that I'm not looking at
[68:49] other options or cheaper options. Um, it doesn't mean that, uh, we will not try
[68:49] to save money. Uh, and,
[68:59] and, uh, you know, we're, I'm basically looking for the MVP here, the minimal viable
[68:59] product, you know,
[69:06] the minimal viable way to get to the point we need, and that's getting a,
[69:06] uh, getting a Michael license. Um,
[69:13] and, uh, for all practical purposes, maybe these two months will be enough to get
[69:13] us over the threshold,
[69:21] at least of showing that we're in, in process. Um, and, you know, if, if
[69:21] we're with the raised fees and
[69:30] fingers crossed dash price increasing again, uh, then we wouldn't ask for another dime. Why
[69:30] should we?
[69:36] We're, if we're showing profits, why would we ask for more? It's basically because we
[69:36] don't have any
[69:43] money, don't have any funds, no wiggle room. Um, but we want to get started
[69:43] on it. Right. Okay. Crowd,
[69:51] uh, one time has another question. He says, would crowd another question, then he's two
[69:51] time, right?
[69:58] Oh yeah. Uh, would crowd not ever confiscate users funds if they don't do KYC?
[70:03] I foresee that if we don't manage to get a Mika license, we'll be damn
[70:03] sure to eject everything
[70:10] before the end of the grandfathering period of 18 months. No. Okay. So if in
[70:10] the worst case scenario,
[70:18] um, the financial task action task force comes out with regulations that say tomorrow you
[70:18] need to,
[70:26] um, uh, perform, know your customer requirements on all of your customers and you will
[70:26] not give them,
[70:34] you may not give them the funds back until they do KYC. What does crowd
[70:34] no do in this case?
[70:40] I'm no hero. If they threaten me with jail time, I will, uh, have to
[70:40] abide by their silly rules, which is
[70:50] also, I think why, uh, everyone should pestering to be pestering all chats with go
[70:50] trustless,
[70:57] go trustless. Cause then it's, it's basically just broadcasting the refund transaction. You have your
[71:02] funds back. Right. Um, you know, I don't, I don't foresee a situation where the
[71:02] Danish FSA is gonna,
[71:09] you know, do that. I don't either, but, um, I, but it's trying to hypothesize
[71:09] on it and, and I'm not gonna
[71:17] look at jail time or, uh, you know, a fine of, I don't know how
[71:17] many years of my life it will take to
[71:23] not recover. Right. Um, so, so we won't, uh, but go trustless. Right. Uh, okay.
[71:23] And speaking of trustless,
[71:35] one time has one more question, so he's now three times, he says, um,
[71:40] would it take years to make crowd no totally non-custodial? How long would it take?
[71:52] A couple of months, but, but again, uh, that's providing, uh, the API, um, the
[71:52] mechanisms,
[72:04] you know, the process, what does it, you know, but, and then someone needs to
[72:04] implement the other side of
[72:10] things, the wallet side. Um, right. And, and what I've. It's not gonna fly if
[72:10] it's not fully automated.
[72:18] If, if, if users have to manually do signatures and stuff like that, it wouldn't,
[72:18] it wouldn't, I don't
[72:24] think that you'd get much, uh, adoption. Exactly. Yeah. And my point is really, we
[72:24] have, you know,
[72:30] with the API, it's also possible to, uh, to completely as an API user with
[72:30] all the anonymity,
[72:36] privacy that comes with that to vote. Um, but I haven't seen anyone that's implement,
[72:36] uh, the voting
[72:44] capabilities we have on our platform. It's been sitting there for, for over two years.
[72:44] Right.
[72:49] So I'm, my fear is that I'm built that we're building even more on, uh,
[72:49] some of the excellent
[72:55] capabilities that crowd node as a service, uh, has an, and even better in the
[72:55] future. Right. And
[73:02] nobody picks it up in the other end. Uh, I think you, you did really
[73:02] well and I actually enjoyed, uh,
[73:08] I think I've seen two presentations on, on the implementation of, of utilizing the, uh,
[73:08] the API, um,
[73:15] from, from your end, right. Facilitated by you. Um, and, and, and picking up on
[73:15] a capability to,
[73:23] you know, build voting, uh, in a, um, incubator wallet, uh, or the mobile wallet,
[73:23] uh, would be
[73:32] amazing, but also picking up on when we then do an API for trustless, um,
[73:32] which would be a different
[73:38] API than what we need for a hundred percent non-custodial. Um, but, but I think,
[73:38] I think both
[73:46] would be doable, uh, within, you know, a couple of months, you know, Q1 was,
[73:46] uh, was what I put on the
[73:52] roadmap, uh, at least for, for the technical deliveries to be done on crowd notes.
[73:52] And.
[73:59] Okay. Well, um, with that, I think that's all the questions that I had. Um,
[73:59] let me just double check.
[74:08] I, I, I've, I've asked most of my questions. Um, I think everybody else has
[74:08] asked, asked their questions.
[74:19] Um, there, I did have one question that I didn't ask that's related to coin
[74:19] joins. Um, my, uh, it's a bit
[74:30] of a, I don't know if you can answer the question because we don't yet
[74:30] know what kind of KYC regulations,
[74:39] the financial action task force will come up with. Yeah. But if they do, my
[74:39] assumption is that they,
[74:45] they will not, you know, if they require KYC, then it doesn't matter that you
[74:45] have coin joined funds,
[74:53] but if they don't require KYC, um, what, how do you deal with coin joined
[74:53] funds? Uh, is it okay?
[75:05] Maybe you could speak to that just real briefly. Um, can, would you allow coin
[75:05] joined funds to transfer
[75:14] into crowd node, the single crowd node address? Um, and do you have anything to
[75:14] say about that without
[75:20] knowing what kind of regulations might be in the future? Yeah, sure. Uh, also I
[75:20] think let me draw a
[75:30] reference. I heard, uh, and I'm not gonna mention them, uh, by name, but some
[75:30] of the larger, uh, wallet
[75:37] apps out there that are, uh, basically building self custody wallets. Um, they, they have
[75:37] spent a lot of
[75:49] time and money looking at, will they be required to do KYC when they're even
[75:49] just providing, you know,
[75:56] a self custody wallet software. Um, and the speculative, uh, answer was no, it doesn't
[75:56] make sense, but what
[76:06] if, um, and the idea would then be that if you use this sort of
[76:06] one address principle that's then in their
[76:17] your case, uh, referred to as a, um, exchange address. So an address that an
[76:17] exchange has verified, uh,
[76:28] ownership for. So you provided, what do I know the full KYC charade to cotton
[76:28] and they know that that's
[76:36] your address. Then the wallet provider could piggyback on that being a known address and
[76:36] then not do KYC.
[76:46] Right. So if we, if we take that, um, uh, and extend that a little
[76:46] bit, then, then I, I don't see why we
[76:53] shouldn't be able to sort of do, do, do apply the same principles. Um, but
[76:53] back to the, the complete mixed
[77:02] funds into a crowd node address and then onto the platform. Um, uh, it's, it's
[77:02] not the same, but it, it can
[77:11] correlate a little bit, I suppose. Um, and you know, for all practical purposes, uh,
[77:11] I don't see why we
[77:20] wouldn't allow it. Um, because it's still the one address that is verifiable where the
[77:20] funds are coming
[77:27] from and going back to. Right. Okay. Anything else that you want to say, uh,
[77:27] before we wrap up again,
[77:35] there's, uh, there's three days left to vote for this proposal. Um, yeah. What's true
[77:35] for a lot of tough
[77:45] questions. Yeah. Um, no, I, you know, I just saw that one time put in
[77:45] another, you know, another question.
[77:55] Would you, would we consider asking for funds to, to, you know, build the non-custodial,
[77:55] um, part, um,
[78:02] and, and, you know, it's, it's an interesting question. Cause I think I did, I
[78:02] laid out that,
[78:09] you know, the money we're asking for is not for us to get paid. Right.
[78:09] Uh, and I intend to continue
[78:17] spending my free time, um, on, on proud note. Uh, it's, it's a hobby. I
[78:17] love the project. I think dash
[78:25] is a very interesting, uh, project as well, especially these days with platform. Um, would
[78:25] I mind
[78:32] getting paid? Not at all, but this proposal is basically just covering external cost. Yeah.
[78:32] Right.
[78:41] And that's, that's something else entirely. And I do see this can benefit, you know,
[78:41] the, the community
[78:47] as a whole, if we write policies, if we get a, you know, con contextually
[78:47] write something that makes
[78:54] sense for crowd note, but at least some of what we write up, um, and
[78:54] get lawyers to sign off on and get
[79:02] auditors to validate, um, I'll be happy to share with, with any DFO. Uh, uh,
[79:02] so, so, you know,
[79:10] Joel is interested in that, that aspect of it, um, because he has to, he
[79:10] has, he has the hard job of,
[79:17] of trying to get, you know, dash into as many venues as possible here in
[79:17] the United States. So this,
[79:26] these funds could be used and reused in other contexts as well. If, um, so
[79:26] I, even though I don't personally
[79:38] support this proposal, I do want that to be made known that this, getting this
[79:38] Mika license could
[79:48] have, uh, benefits, not just for you in crowd node, but also for Joel and
[79:48] what he's doing and maybe even
[79:56] DCG. Um, so I just wanted to throw that out as well, but I also
[79:56] wanted to say that, um, I kind of wish that
[80:05] crowd node had and, and did, and, and maybe even in the future would ask
[80:05] for funds for, for you personally
[80:12] to be paid, because that is the, the way that we can, uh, best retain
[80:12] our sovereignty in the,
[80:22] in the, in a certain sense of the term. Like I, I, I go on
[80:22] Twitter as, as Ryan sovereign for a reason.
[80:30] I think that everybody deserves their personal sovereignty and not that sovereignty should not
[80:36] lay in nation states. It's not nation states that should be sovereign. It should be
[80:36] individuals.
[80:43] And, um, in terms of dash, uh, I think that the best way that we
[80:43] can remain sovereign as a project,
[80:50] uh, as the dash project itself is that we pay our own people to build
[80:50] open source tooling.
[80:57] And we don't get captured by, um, other, other sources of funding, because I know
[80:57] that you guys
[81:06] haven't received any venture funding. I, at least I don't think you're doing this out
[81:06] of the goodness
[81:11] of your own hearts. And so that's another way.
[81:14] It's all 12% equity to diff and got, you know, sharing a couple of years
[81:14] back, right?
[81:20] That's an internal funding still though. Yeah. Yeah. I just see so many projects,
[81:27] so many projects in the crypto space, they get captured by, um, this outside funding.
[81:27] And I don't
[81:34] want to see that happen with any of our projects so far. We've been good
[81:34] with not letting that happen
[81:40] because we pay our own developers, but, um, yeah, I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
[81:40] aware of the financial
[81:50] issue. I've, you're obviously a for-profit company. So you hopefully want to make money at
[81:50] some point
[81:56] in the future. Um, but right now you're essentially operating as a nonprofit because
[82:01] we're also outsourcing the note operation probably is more than the revenue that you're getting
[82:01] from
[82:09] the 15% share, right? Yeah. And for those that want some detailed calculations in size,
[82:15] they can watch the two and a half hour podcast dash podcast, right? It, you
[82:15] know, right. To me, this is,
[82:21] um, you know, work through the problem, uh, get in dialogue with, uh, the people,
[82:21] the regulators, the
[82:29] Danish FSA, um, possibly get a license, possibly at least get a lot more clever
[82:29] on what's up and down,
[82:36] what's possible and what's not, um, and all this as opposed to duck and cover,
[82:36] um, not try to get a hold
[82:47] of, uh, the opinions of those regulating us, having the, the oversight, uh, with an
[82:47] extreme risk. I know
[82:56] it's, it's, it's way out there of dash developers being the next tornado cash guys,
[82:56] right? You know,
[83:03] I, I, I, I'd rather engage in dialogue and make sure that, that it's, unless
[83:03] you works, you know,
[83:09] with a pseudonym in front of you, right? You should, you know, it's, it should
[83:09] still be safe to be
[83:14] whomever in DCG that's on, on the payroll there to work officially for the project
[83:14] and not live in fear
[83:23] of regulatory overreach, right? And I, I see, I see that, that extreme scares me
[83:23] much more than not
[83:30] getting a license, but we have to take the dialogue, uh, and we have to
[83:30] take a fight, take a stance,
[83:36] work through the problem. I'm repeating myself. I know, but I really think this is
[83:36] imperative and not
[83:42] do this, you know, there's, there's other projects that, that can fly below the radar.
[83:42] Uh, and if you
[83:49] want to stay more dark, you can do so. And again, I totally agree with
[83:49] the sovereignty that, that, that,
[83:54] that you're, um, bringing forward, but that's again, not the same as hiding and not
[83:54] talking with regulators
[84:00] and not engaging. I think those two coexist fine, but hiding and not trying to
[84:00] engage in dialogue and not
[84:08] trying to push and persuade, um, that's, that's going to be a more certain end
[84:08] for, for a, a, a wonderful
[84:19] community such as, as I fear out in the, at this end of the scale,
[84:19] right? So let's take the fight, let's try it
[84:27] out. Uh, that's all I'm motivating for, but we need a bit of hope. Uh,
[84:27] you know, I don't speak
[84:33] legalese. I need someone to write at least a valid statement on, on, uh, on
[84:33] what we have is good enough
[84:39] or, you know, help us to improve on it. Um, and, um, at least we're
[84:39] going to get smarter on everything
[84:47] in terms of what it takes and what it doesn't take. And maybe CrowdNode's future
[84:47] is only, uh, non-custodial and
[84:53] trustless. Okay. I think we'll leave it at that. Thank you for your time. I,
[84:53] I kept you a little
[85:00] bit longer. You, you mentioned 90 minutes. So I, I, so I think, uh, yeah,
[85:00] I appreciate, I appreciate all
[85:10] the work you've done. I appreciate you putting in this proposal and, uh, coming on
[85:10] the show twice now,
[85:16] two shows, uh, you're welcome and everybody else go out and vote and, uh, we'll,
[85:16] we'll leave it there.
[85:23] Thank you very much, everyone.
