## Chapters

### 00:00 - Introduction and Overview

In these opening minutes, the host sets the stage by welcoming Taha and Calvin, introducing them as contributors to a visual blockchain explorer known as TXCity.io. They highlight how this platform transforms seemingly abstract technical data into a user-friendly interface. Through whimsical characters, buses, and themed “houses,” the tool visually represents different transaction types and blockchain operations in real time. The conversation aims to showcase how these graphics engage users by removing the intimidating complexity of raw data.

They also reflect on prior guests, offering context for how different proposals and topics relate to the broader Dash ecosystem. The host underscores this episode’s more lighthearted angle, contrasting the previous deep-dive into governance decisions with a more hands-on demonstration of practical blockchain applications. Taha and Calvin’s enthusiasm sets the tone for a session that blends both education and interactive elements.

### 03:00 - 09:00 History of TXCity.io and Forking TX Street

Taha recounts how TX Street, the original project, gained popularity in the crypto community thanks to tweets from high-profile figures like Vitalik Buterin. When TX Street’s founder decided to open-source and eventually discontinue that platform, Taha saw an opportunity to keep the concept alive. By forking the code and rebranding the project as TXCity.io, the development team expanded the number of supported chains from five to ten, broadening the tool’s reach.

Calvin shares how his own background in game development aligned perfectly with TXCity.io’s vision for data visualization. He describes the excitement of transforming blockchain transactions into lively, animated scenarios that make sense even to newcomers. The conversation highlights how the open-source ethos enabled them to pick up where TX Street left off, ensuring that a valuable educational resource remains publicly accessible.

### 09:00 - 15:00 Dash Visualization and Multi-Chain Comparisons

Attention shifts to the Dash-specific interface, where Taha and Calvin demonstrate how TXCity.io visualizes Dash transactions side by side with other chains like Bitcoin Cash. The bus size variations offer a direct comparison of block sizes, emphasizing how Dash’s faster speeds and low fees create a notably different user experience. They explain that each “house” on the display represents a distinct category of transaction, such as CoinJoin and PrivateSend for Dash.

Within this conversation, they also highlight the capacity to track and compare mempool activity in real time. This allows users to follow various on-chain events, from normal transactions to specialized operations like mixing. By contrasting Dash with Bitcoin Cash, viewers see how different blockchains handle throughput and time-to-finality, all while maintaining a visually consistent style. This segment underscores the power of animated demonstrations for clarifying technical metrics.

### 15:00 - 21:00 Enhancing On-Chain Literacy Through Visualization

Calvin points out how visual metaphors can make blockchain technology less intimidating to everyday users. Characters walking into buses—representing transaction batching and block production—offer an inviting way to learn how consensus mechanisms work. The conversation touches on how on-chain data can be contextualized, helping users understand fees, confirmations, and block sizes at a glance.

Taha adds that the long-term goal is to push TXCity.io beyond mere visualization. They plan to incorporate interactive elements, such as the ability for users to interact with animated wallets directly, reducing the risks of sending funds to incorrect addresses. This vision emphasizes a user-friendly approach that could help novices build confidence in handling crypto assets, illustrating how seemingly complex processes can be explained through intuitive graphics and gamified elements.

### 21:00 - 27:00 CoinJoin Demonstration and Practical Setup

The talk becomes more hands-on as the host opens a Dash Core wallet to walk through CoinJoin mixing. They show the audience how to activate the feature, explaining the parallel sessions, rounds of mixing, and the minor fees associated. By configuring the wallet for increased anonymity, the demonstration highlights a key balance between convenience and enhanced privacy.

In real time, attendees see how multiple Dash inputs are broken into smaller, standardized denominations. These uniform transaction sizes obscure the link between senders and recipients, showcasing the coin-mixing principle. The seamless interplay between TXCity.io’s visual interface and the wallet’s technical aspects helps clarify what happens on-chain whenever someone opts for privacy features. This tangible example cements the idea that privacy can be straightforward, even for less technical users.

### 27:00 - 33:00 Exploring the Transaction Explorer and Block Details

With mixing in progress, the host reveals how individual transactions appear in Dash’s explorer, connecting the behind-the-scenes mechanics to TXCity.io’s animated dashboard. By clicking on buses in the visualizer, users can see a detailed list of transactions waiting for confirmation. This reinforces how real-time mempool data can be converted into an approachable, colorful narrative.

They also discuss other transaction types, such as op-return messages and specialized commands related to Dash Platform or other integrated protocols. While many transactions remain standard transfers, some contain extra metadata or bridging operations. By illustrating how each operation becomes a recognizable character or icon on TXCity.io, the presenters show the versatility of using visual labels. This segment underlines the potential for even more customized displays of diverse blockchain activities.

### 33:00 - 38:00 PrivateSend Transactions and User Experience

Having shown CoinJoin mixing, the host proceeds to execute a PrivateSend transaction in the Dash wallet, distinguishing it from standard sends. They illustrate how once coins have reached a specified number of mixing rounds, users can transfer them privately to one or more addresses. Viewers see the transaction appear in TXCity.io as a distinct character type, proving that privacy needn’t be overly complex or purely abstract.

Throughout this part of the demonstration, Calvin’s character designs take center stage. From color-coded outfits to subtle animations, the visual cues quickly indicate which transactions are private or purely standard. This approach offers a refreshing alternative to text-heavy block explorers. By walking through each step on screen, the presenters confirm how straightforward it is to add meaningful layers of anonymity without sacrificing user-friendliness.

### 38:00 - 41:25 Future Plans, Community Involvement, and Closing

Concluding the session, Taha and Calvin outline their roadmap for expanding TXCity.io. Beyond adding more transaction types and houses for Dash, they envision integrating cross-chain bridges and Dash Platform operations. The ability to move characters across bridges would make inter-network transactions equally vivid, offering an even more comprehensive educational tool.

They invite the Dash community to use TXCity.io, suggesting it as both an alternative block explorer and a way to follow personal addresses in a visually engaging manner. The host praises the project’s open-source roots and encourages Taha and Calvin to propose future work on the Dash network. The episode closes with gratitude for the collaboration, reflecting the overall excitement about TXCity.io’s potential to enhance on-chain literacy and simplify complex crypto processes for everyone.

## Transcript

[00:00] Welcome, everybody, to another week of Incubator Weekly. Today, we've got on the show Taha
[00:00] and
[00:09] Calvin from TX City, Transaction City. How's it going, guys?
[00:14] Good, good. Yeah, it's going great. It's going great.
[00:18] Good. Yeah, this week is going to be a little bit more fun than last
[00:18] week. Last week, we had
[00:27] we had the the guys on from Crowdnode and we're talking about their proposal that
[00:27] ended up
[00:33] passing. But it was a little bit of a well, I thought it was going
[00:33] to be more controversial
[00:38] than it actually ended up being. But yeah, I was glad to see that that
[00:38] happen, even though I didn't
[00:45] support it. It's always good to see. I don't support paying regulators in general, but
[00:45] I understood their
[00:52] situation. And yeah, I just I love to have the Dow vote for whatever the
[00:52] Dow wants. And that's what
[01:00] happened. So that was it's always good to have an informed decision. So today, yeah,
[01:00] like I said,
[01:05] we've got a funner show. We've got Transaction City. I'm going to bring that up,
[01:05] bring up the site in just a
[01:12] moment. But why don't you guys talk about what the history is? Because Transaction City,
[01:19] from my memory, I'm one of these guys that's been around in the crypto scene
[01:19] for over 10 years,
[01:26] and I seem to remember it being called Transaction Street at some point. So can
[01:26] you tell us what
[01:31] Transaction City is and a little bit about about the history and about how you
[01:31] two are working together on
[01:37] this? Yeah, sure. So definitely Transaction Street, TX Street was very popular in the Web3
[01:37] community way
[01:50] back in 2020, especially even Vitalik and other popular founders tweeted about it. And so
[01:50] I tried
[01:59] to connect with the TX Street founder and I was able to connect with him.
[01:59] And we were in connection for
[02:06] like almost three years from from 2020 2023. And I think last year he was
[02:06] saying that he wants to shut
[02:15] down TX Street. So I was like, okay, why are you trying to shut it
[02:15] down? So right now he has open source the
[02:23] code and we are running the fork version of our own fork version and we
[02:23] called it TX City. So we have expanded
[02:31] a lot. TX Street had, I think, five chains. So right now we have 10
[02:31] chains running on TX City with 15,000
[02:42] monthly users, visitors coming to the website. So yeah, that's the history we have at
[02:42] TX City. Kelvin is
[02:51] working with us as a game developer. Yeah. Kelvin, if you want to share your
[02:51] journey in TX City.
[02:57] Oh, okay. My journey in TX City has been awesome. I reached out, I actually
[02:57] even knew TX Street before
[03:07] joining TX City. So it was quite coincidental. And it was, it's a fun project.
[03:07] And it's,
[03:14] uh, I really enjoyed it because it really helped demystify the blockchain coming from a
[03:14] game developer
[03:21] background. I really enjoyed it. So visualizing stuff, visualizing this data, just like database,
[03:27] which was, uh, quite something that I would enjoy doing. And I thought about it.
[03:27] And, uh, about like,
[03:34] uh, last year in the end, uh, we hooked up with Taha and he brought
[03:34] me on board. And ever since,
[03:40] we've been having great ideas on how to grow TX City. Yeah, that's the, that's
[03:40] the power of open source.
[03:48] Uh, I'm glad that that worked out, uh, so that transaction city could, uh, live
[03:48] a new life and,
[03:54] uh, we are going to, let's go ahead and show that right now. Um, we
[03:54] have, uh, you've done a little work
[04:02] for the, for the dash incubator, um, getting some of the basic functionality working. So
[04:02] tell me, um,
[04:09] tell me if what I'm showing is, is good in just a minute here. Um,
[04:09] let's see. I think I just have
[04:20] to change the view here, I guess. Okay. And then, um, so y'all see transaction
[04:20] city website right now.
[04:30] Yeah. Okay. And do you see, you see the, uh, the dash, uh, core wallet
[04:30] now as well?
[04:36] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we're going to go ahead and, um,
[04:41] actually I'm just going to see the URL again. I don't want Ethereum and Bitcoin.
[04:41] I want dash.
[04:48] So we're going to go ahead and say dash here. And, uh, we're going to
[04:48] say Bitcoin cash on this other side,
[04:56] and then we'll launch this. Uh, this will give us an idea of, um, what's
[04:56] going on in the,
[05:03] the two blockchains. So we're not going to show the two blockchains side to side
[05:03] the whole time here,
[05:07] just, uh, initially. Um, so you can see, why don't you guys show us, uh,
[05:07] tell, tell us what we're
[05:15] looking at here. Yeah, sure. So what you are looking at right now is there
[05:15] are two different
[05:22] blockchains, uh, at the, on the same screen on the left, you can see dash
[05:22] and on the right,
[05:29] you can see Bitcoin cash. So apparently you can see the difference between dash. The
[05:29] first difference
[05:35] itself you can see is, uh, the block size. So Bitcoin cash has a larger
[05:35] block size than dash.
[05:42] But if you see the transaction speed, uh, sorry, I'm switching views just real quick
[05:42] here so that I can,
[05:50] I can show you guys as well. Cause I, I forgot to bring up us
[05:50] as well. So go ahead and keep going.
[05:55] Yeah. So, uh, yeah. So, uh, yeah. So the first apparent, uh, apparent, uh, visual
[05:55] is that Bitcoin
[06:03] cash has larger block size than dash, but you can see dash has faster transaction,
[06:03] faster transaction
[06:10] speed and even less transaction fees. So what we are doing here is we have
[06:10] contextualized on-chain data
[06:17] and demystified for any user, uh, to understand how blockchain works. So every character is
[06:17] shown as a
[06:27] transaction and every bus is shown as a block. Uh, the houses you see on
[06:27] the left side on the green
[06:34] lanes, uh, they are dApps running on the blockchain. So dash has two dApps, two
[06:34] houses. One is if you click
[06:44] on it, you can even click on the houses. Uh, you can see if we
[06:44] have coin join as a house, um, where you
[06:52] can see live transactions coming out of, uh, the coin join house. And also you
[06:52] get to see the recent
[06:59] transactions. Uh, for the same, we also have private send, uh, private send house. Private
[06:59] send house
[07:07] will show private send transactions and the, the, it has different character, a character for
[07:07] private
[07:13] sent is like, uh, hidden ninja, which was made by Kelvin. And for coin join,
[07:13] it is something like a bit
[07:21] flashy. So, so yeah, so this is what you are seeing. And you can also
[07:21] check, uh, the entire blockchain
[07:27] statistics, uh, on the bottom left, uh, for dash, like at the bottom. Yeah. Uh,
[07:27] if you click, yeah. Yeah.
[07:35] So you can get more, a bit more detailed info of, uh, a chain. Um,
[07:35] you can also, uh, click on the bus
[07:44] to get the block details. Uh, if, if you, yeah, you can click on the
[07:44] bus to get all the block details. Uh,
[07:52] you can do show list to check the transactions, which are pending in the block.
[07:52] So, uh, so this is
[08:00] basically, uh, you can call it a mempool, uh, visualizer to be more specific and
[08:00] you can also
[08:06] search a transactions. You can follow a transaction. You can search a transaction. So if
[08:06] you click on dash
[08:12] or at top on the top menu, yeah, dash, and if you click there and
[08:12] yeah, you can, you can see a search
[08:18] bar so you can search or follow some specific addresses. Uh, if you'd like to
[08:18] see them moving
[08:25] in real time across the street to the bus and the transaction sitting there and
[08:25] waiting to cross the
[08:32] signal. Okay. Yeah. This is, this is what you see. I'm actually gonna, um, cause
[08:32] I know you have this
[08:39] little banner, uh, that you can, people can contribute to transaction city here. This is
[08:39] your
[08:44] address. This is also the address that you've been using to claim incubator tasks as
[08:44] well. I noticed.
[08:50] So we'll, we'll use that as a, as an example here for the search that
[08:50] you mentioned and see a little
[08:57] bit. Uh, so no recent activity was found, but if we follow this, what happens?
[08:57] Okay. Okay. Or click on it,
[09:05] I guess, um, that just brings up the block chair, uh, history and whatnot. Explorer.
[09:05] Explorer. Yep.
[09:14] Okay. Um, and then also, uh, we can bring up, um,
[09:23] we can bring up the stats for Bitcoin cash, for example, Bitcoin cash, just using
[09:23] this as an example,
[09:32] because it's one of the closest, uh, chains to what we're trying to accomplish as
[09:32] well.
[09:37] Um, and the bus is bigger. You said, because the block size is, is bigger
[09:37] now. I don't know if people
[09:45] have noticed, but when the bus goes off, that's when, when it goes to the
[09:45] blockchain, uh, down the street,
[09:52] uh, it shrinks to a size that is actually, um, the size of the block.
[09:52] So it's not like there's eight
[09:59] megabyte blocks for Bitcoin cash every, every, uh, 10 minutes or so. And it just,
[09:59] you know, that's not
[10:07] exactly how it works. So when you look at Bitcoin cash block bus, it looks
[10:07] big and, you know, it looks a
[10:13] little oversized there, what they're using right now, but blocks are the size of the
[10:13] blocks regardless
[10:19] of how much the capacity is. Uh, but people will also remember that, that dash
[10:19] actually increased the
[10:25] block size from one megabyte to two megabytes in one of our first governance decisions,
[10:25] uh, just as a sign
[10:31] of like, we can make this decision very easily if, if, and whenever we need
[10:31] to. So, uh, technically,
[10:37] I don't know if each of, uh, it looks like each of these segments is
[10:37] probably one megabyte, uh,
[10:43] in this case. So technically dashes bus would be the two, two segments long. We
[10:43] could change that if we
[10:52] wanted to, but, uh, not something that's, uh, critical anyway, to, to what's going on.
[10:52] Um, but I do want
[10:58] to, I'm going to bring in the, um, actually Calvin, I want to talk to
[10:58] you a little bit about, are you the
[11:05] one that's designing these characters? Is that what I heard? Yeah. Yeah, sure.
[11:09] Yeah, cool. Um, just a minute here. Um, so you mentioned, uh, Taha, you mentioned
[11:09] that each of these
[11:20] houses are dApps and in, in our case, uh, we customized this a little bit.
[11:20] Uh, these, these blocks
[11:27] aren't necessarily dApps on our block, on our, uh, on our base proof of proof
[11:27] of work chain, they're
[11:34] types of transactions. So you can do fully customized, whatever you want, any kind of
[11:40] transaction that has any kind of characteristics you can represent as one of these houses.
[11:45] And so we have this, the, the coin join, uh, what we're calling coin join
[11:45] transactions. And then
[11:50] what I'm calling, um, uh, private send transactions. I did want to explain that a
[11:50] little bit because
[11:58] people might not know the difference, uh, of those, uh, even in the dash community,
[12:03] sometimes we use these terms synonymously, but, um, I, uh, I'm making a clear distinction
[12:03] between these
[12:11] two. Uh, I think in the, in the core wallet, which we'll look at in
[12:11] a minute here, we'll, we'll actually
[12:17] do some live testing here in a minute. Um, in the core wallet, these are
[12:17] called coin join, um,
[12:24] mix and coin join send transactions. But, uh, for the sake of some people in
[12:24] the dash community,
[12:32] um, like the term private send still. And so, uh, the coin join send is
[12:32] synonymous with a private
[12:38] transaction, just for anybody that's wondering how we've named those. And, um, did you guys
[12:38] have something
[12:44] to say? I think I might've cut you off. No, no. No, no. I think
[12:44] that. Yeah. So it's, it's just that,
[12:53] uh, we are trying, we are filtering out specific transactions. So, uh, from the houses.
[12:53] So coin
[13:00] join and, uh, private send transactions are those right now you can see, uh, coming
[13:00] out of from the house.
[13:07] Yep. And, and we will, um, we will show one of those right now, I
[13:07] think. So you can see just
[13:15] generally speaking, you can see there's a lot more coin join transactions happening. The mixing
[13:20] transactions happening. This, uh, this light blue guy that goes in every now and then
[13:20] we haven't seen
[13:26] any private send transactions. They're more rare. So we're going to make one on our
[13:26] own. And I've got,
[13:33] I've got a wallet that's basically got a clear history other than the fact that
[13:33] I sent two dash
[13:39] to it. So, um, in real time, we're going to, we're going to just do
[13:39] some coin joining. We'll start this
[13:45] coin join process right here. And we'll look at this transactions tab a little bit.
[13:45] I, I want to use this
[13:52] as an, Oh, somebody just did a private send. It looks like, um, uh, that
[13:52] one wasn't me. So that
[13:57] was just some network participant. Um, if you look in the bus here, you can
[13:57] kind of see him hiding in
[14:04] there. You see the, all the other transactions that are just normal, um, not special
[14:04] transactions.
[14:10] Those are, uh, guys that look like me, blonde hair. Um, they're all the same.
[14:10] And, um, in the future,
[14:19] we'll have different transaction types. Uh, we'll talk about that a little bit at the
[14:19] end of the show,
[14:24] what our hopeful plans are, uh, going forward. But, uh, like I said, these are
[14:24] transactions.
[14:31] Uh, the, the yellow haired guys are just normal transactions that aren't coin join or
[14:31] private send.
[14:36] Uh, they could be special in other senses. For example, uh, there are a lot
[14:36] of op return transactions.
[14:43] If I click on this bus here, uh, like you were saying earlier, and I
[14:43] show the list,
[14:48] we'll probably see some of these, uh, op return transactions. I'll just click on this
[14:48] one right
[14:53] now. Just curious to see what this might be. It's a normal transaction, but it
[14:53] has an op return message
[14:58] on it. And so if you click in here, um, our, uh, our old, uh,
[14:58] insight explorer doesn't parse this, uh,
[15:10] properly. So this one's not going to show anything, but I'm guessing this may be
[15:10] a dash platform
[15:17] transaction, uh, uh, for topping up, uh, an identity. So we'll talk about that a
[15:17] little bit
[15:22] in the future. Uh, that's, we do want to, um, open, open this transaction city,
[15:22] uh, up to dash platform
[15:30] as well. So, um, this way, instead of being a normal transaction, this would have
[15:30] a new house
[15:36] and, uh, it would show the data that's associated with this transaction. Now there might
[15:36] not be any data.
[15:43] This, this is probably a top up, uh, identity create transaction is what I'm guessing
[15:43] based
[15:47] on this amount here, 0.0001 dash. Um, so anyway, we'll, uh, we'll talk about that
[15:47] a little bit more
[15:55] later. Uh, I wanna look, you might also, we might also just get lucky and
[15:55] find some kind of a Maya
[16:01] transaction here. So I'm gonna click on this one as well and see if we
[16:01] can't find one that, that looks
[16:07] to be the same, a dash platform one as well. I'm gonna keep looking down
[16:07] this list.
[16:13] Uh, but anyway, if you saw a Maya transaction, what you'd see is when you
[16:13] click on it,
[16:17] here's that private send transaction, by the way. Um, if you click on it and
[16:17] you'd see actual message,
[16:23] in that op return field, and then we could decode it, uh, and see if,
[16:23] see what that op return message
[16:31] was. Now on the Bitcoin cash side, you can kind of see that as an
[16:31] example. I think some of these,
[16:37] um, memo ones show actual op return data. Does it not? Um, these also have
[16:37] op return data.
[16:46] So anyway, um, we're hoping to, to build out this houses, these houses more to
[16:46] have like Maya
[16:53] transactions dash platform transactions, and ultimately having a whole other street for dash
[17:00] platform and have dash platform transactions on this side. So you could see him going
[17:00] from one,
[17:05] one side to the other. Um, and that would be a good, like in general,
[17:05] this is a good educational,
[17:13] um, educational tool. Like, like you were saying, Calvin, I think one of you were
[17:13] saying, uh, you
[17:18] know, it takes a little bit to wrap your head around what blockchains are. And
[17:18] this is, is a great
[17:24] educational tool, if nothing else, even if you don't use it, you know, as a
[17:24] functional block explorer,
[17:30] it's, it's great to educate people and, and show visually what kind of things are
[17:30] happening on different
[17:37] blockchains. Have you, um, just, just curious, have you, these are the chains that you
[17:37] support. Have you, um,
[17:46] have you had anybody else use this as some kind of educational tool in any
[17:46] setting that you, that you
[17:53] know of, or, uh, what about these other chains done? Uh, yeah, recently, uh, during
[17:53] the, uh, token for 2049
[18:04] event at Singapore. Uh, so, uh, uh, uh, at the art and science museum that
[18:04] they had displayed transaction
[18:12] city, uh, especially the Bitcoin, the Bitcoin chain to, to educate users, uh, or any,
[18:12] anyone, uh, at the
[18:22] museum coming at the museum and show like this, how a block looks and this
[18:22] is how transaction process happens
[18:29] Yeah. So, uh, at the, at the chain level. So, so yeah, I mean, our
[18:29] idea, the whole idea behind TXCT
[18:35] is to promote on-chain literacy and at the core, we are definitely visualizers, but, uh,
[18:35] uh, eventually we
[18:44] are also going to add more on-chain interactivity, uh, on TXCT. So you see the,
[18:44] the, you see the characters,
[18:52] right. The characters will be represented as wallets in future. So instead of giving user
[18:59] addresses with complex numbers, we give them a character. So, and with that character, they
[18:59] can
[19:06] create tags on the wallet. They can, uh, transfer stake, uh, swap or do whatever
[19:06] on-chain activity they
[19:15] like to. And then the reason behind this is to distinguish between addresses and contracts.
[19:21] That's the primary reason. And to make sure a user doesn't transfer it, uh, to
[19:21] a wrong address, uh, to
[19:29] minimize the door, to mitigate the risk of transferring in to, uh, incorrect address, which
[19:29] has caused a lot of,
[19:38] loss of funds, uh, previously. So, so yeah, uh, this is what we are trying
[19:38] to do. We are trying to
[19:44] entirely, uh, change the UI UX dynamics for blockchain, uh, instead of numbers and complex
[19:53] explorers. We just want to make it simple, demystify, contextualize, uh, to promote the on-chain
[20:00] with addresses. Okay. Well, that will, that will be very interesting with our upcoming, uh,
[20:00] username
[20:07] feature that that's on dash platform. So that, that's good to, uh, good to hear.
[20:07] All right. So
[20:12] let's jump right into, uh, oh, go ahead. All right. You had mentioned something about,
[20:12] uh, going from one
[20:19] street to the other, uh, that's actually a feature that is in the works and
[20:19] it's working for some, some
[20:25] chains. We are calling it a bridge is that there's actually a bridge where, uh,
[20:25] character drops out
[20:31] and then traverses the bridge onto the other side, uh, visualizing a bridge transaction from
[20:31] one chain
[20:36] to another. Okay. Very cool. Yeah. I, I think I've seen something about that and
[20:36] we'll, uh, look forward
[20:42] to that for, uh, potential dash platform integration. Um, I've, I'm encouraging you, you all
[20:42] to actually
[20:50] submit your own proposal. I'll just get right into that part. And so, so I
[20:50] don't forget it, but, um,
[20:55] the hope is that we've in the incubator, we've got, um, we want to incubate
[20:55] projects and, and kind of
[21:02] push them to be, uh, having their own proposals as soon as possible. So, um,
[21:02] this is a, I think,
[21:10] perfect example of what we're trying to go for in the incubator is, uh, we've,
[21:10] we've taken you from
[21:16] step zero to one by having you, uh, do some of this work through the
[21:16] incubator, doing the, the coin join, the
[21:23] private send, just getting up to speed on what dashes, uh, all together. And, um,
[21:29] yeah, I'm encouraging you to, to put in your own proposal, to continue this work,
[21:29] um, doing more
[21:36] houses for transaction types, putting in, uh, uh, doing dash platform. So we're not ready
[21:36] with that
[21:44] yet, but that's, that's the hope in the future. So if you like what you're
[21:44] seeing here, um, you can,
[21:49] uh, look forward to the, the proposal, the network independent network proposal for transaction city
[21:49] on
[21:55] that. Um, but let's go ahead and, uh, let's do some transactions here. Let's, um,
[21:55] let's start the coin
[22:02] join process. And when we do that, we're probably going to see a bunch of
[22:02] coin join transactions because
[22:08] this wallet has not been denominated yet even. Um, so that's the first thing that
[22:08] we'll see in this
[22:13] transaction tab is when we send, uh, when we click start coin join, the first
[22:13] thing that we'll do is
[22:20] it will take this two dash and it will say, let's break that down into,
[22:20] let's say, uh, nine,
[22:27] nine point ones. Maybe it will have a one and nine point ones and then
[22:27] 9.00 ones. And let's just see what
[22:36] happens. So start coin join. Um, okay. So this is the first time I'm using
[22:36] this. I hope I remember
[22:44] this, uh, simple password because, uh, this is just kind of a demo wallet. So
[22:44] let's, uh,
[22:49] yeah, it's, I gotta, I gotta guess a few things here. This is my, my
[22:49] easy passwords. Okay. Uh, got it.
[23:00] So we're going to start, uh, it's, it's starting now. So we should start seeing
[23:00] some transactions
[23:05] here on the transactions tab. That was probably the create denominations transaction right there that
[23:12] just went in. Um, and I guess, uh, ah, we probably should have started this
[23:12] right at the beginning of
[23:24] the show. Cause we're not going to have, it might take too long to, to
[23:24] actually get a balance big enough
[23:29] for, uh, with enough mixes to, to do the, to do the private send, but
[23:29] I wanted to make this show a
[23:36] little bit, uh, of an educational tool as well, not just for transaction city, but
[23:36] also for the,
[23:41] for the mixing process and coin join and private send, uh, just for the dash
[23:41] community as well. So
[23:49] if we go into, um, the settings here, you can see, and actually before I
[23:49] do that, I'm going to,
[23:57] I'm going to mix the, the Bitcoin cash side for a minute here. So if
[23:57] we go here and just go single
[24:02] view, that will be fewer things to, to keep track of on the, on the
[24:02] site here.
[24:14] I'm going to go back to just to give a disclaimer. We, we, uh, we
[24:14] finished a development
[24:21] yesterday. Yeah. Forgive us if there is some issue with, with transaction filter.
[24:27] Yeah. Yep. Yeah. There, there, there are still a couple known, known issues. Um, but
[24:27] I have tested this.
[24:35] It has worked in the past. You've tested it. It's worked. Um, so we're going
[24:35] to go ahead and go down
[24:41] to, we're going to do, uh, we're going to bump up the parallel sessions to
[24:41] 10 and we're going to go,
[24:46] uh, we're going to bump the mixing rounds down to the minimum of just two.
[24:46] So, so that way it says that
[24:54] two mixes, two rounds of mixes is sufficient for doing a private send is what
[24:54] that means.
[25:00] And we'll just keep the target balance there, even though we don't have anywhere near
[25:00] that
[25:04] amount. And I like to bump these targets down to the minimum as well. This
[25:04] is just a perfect personal
[25:10] preference. Um, I've found that it works better for my use cases. Okay. So, and
[25:10] then we'll enable multi
[25:20] session as well. So we'll click okay there. And then if we go to the
[25:20] coin join tab and look at the inputs
[25:34] and then toggle show all coin join coins, this will show all of our coins,
[25:34] uh, in the denominations
[25:43] that it's trying to do and the mixing rounds, the confirmations and so forth. So
[25:43] you can see when I
[25:49] first did the coin join, I started the coin join process. It did a, let
[25:49] me go out of here for just a
[25:57] minute. It did a, um, um, create coin join, create denominations transaction where it just,
[25:57] uh, took that
[26:08] to, and it went down into those denominations that you just saw. Okay. And, and
[26:08] then it, it, there's
[26:16] making collateral inputs. So there, there are these different types and we, we haven't broken
[26:16] down the
[26:21] transaction view to, to show all these different types. I don't think that's necessary even,
[26:21] especially
[26:27] when we get into other transaction types, you don't want it to be too cluttered.
[26:27] Uh,
[26:31] but here's a mixing transaction. This, this would be picked up in those coin join,
[26:31] uh, coin join
[26:37] transactions from this house right here. And then, um, okay. So going back to the
[26:37] coin join tab inputs,
[26:48] show all coins. You can see here, this one has one mixing round. So once
[26:48] that number gets up to two,
[26:55] it will be eligible for a private send. Um, and some of these other coins
[26:55] are, you can see the,
[27:05] the point zero zero ones, the wallet creates a new address for every, I don't
[27:05] mind showing this by the
[27:11] way, cause I created a whole new profile just, just to be able to show
[27:11] this stuff online. Cause I think
[27:17] it's, it's good to have people see the actual process. This isn't my personal balance
[27:17] in my personal
[27:24] wallet. Um, here are the point ones. And we'll just go click okay on this.
[27:24] Let's see.
[27:36] And then we'll go back to the overview tab for just a minute. And I'm
[27:36] not, I usually see, okay,
[27:44] coin join balance is still zero. And I usually see a progress bar somewhere here.
[27:44] So I'm not sure why
[27:54] that hasn't shown up yet. Let me go back into my, my settings. And I
[27:54] think, I think I know what I need
[28:01] to do on, uh, coin join enable advanced interface. And these are still my settings.
[28:01] So those are good.
[28:11] So now when I go to the overview, I'll see this completion bar and I'll
[28:11] see the submitted
[28:16] denominations that's currently happening in the wallet and you can see as we're talking, there's
[28:22] coin join transactions happening. Um, you can also see that my total balance has gone
[28:22] down a little bit.
[28:29] So this does, this process does cost a little money, um, to, uh, to do,
[28:29] I mean, you, you, you pay
[28:38] for private transactions and that, that makes sense. It's not much though.
[28:43] So, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so I think I can ask one question here,
[28:43] right? Uh, so to do, to do a private
[28:51] send transaction, we have to first do a coin join transaction. Is that correct?
[28:56] Yes, yes, exactly. So coin join coin join is the process of the mixing. And
[28:56] I'm going to actually,
[29:03] I'll, I'll just take the time since we're waiting for this anyway, to, to get
[29:03] to two
[29:07] mixing rounds. There are some that have two already. Uh, this one, for example, has,
[29:12] has two rounds of mixing done. And because in my settings, I said that I
[29:12] am considering two rounds
[29:18] of mixing sufficient for my privacy needs, then I would be able to, to send
[29:18] that coin as a private
[29:25] send transaction. Typically what you want to do is you want that to be, you
[29:25] want to, in your settings,
[29:31] that to be higher. So, um, in coin join, let's see in settings, I have
[29:31] a keyboard shortcut that I'm using
[29:40] for that. But if you wanted to know how to, to get there, you just
[29:40] go up to the dash core menu and then
[29:47] Go coin join. And, um, um, these mixing rounds, you, you'd probably want this. I
[29:47] think this goes up to
[30:05] 16, no 12. Yeah. 16, 16 is the maximum rounds. Like that's, you, nobody's gonna
[30:05] be able to trace
[30:15] back 16 rounds. Uh, it's mathematically not very, uh, likely that you'll ever be able
[30:15] to trace that back.
[30:23] Um, you can, anyway, I won't get into the details of that, but I'm gonna,
[30:23] I'm gonna bump it back down
[30:28] to two, just so that we can demo what we're trying to demo here in
[30:28] a minute. Uh, so did that answer
[30:36] your question? Um, so yes, you have to, when you start the mixing transactions, um,
[30:36] you have to have
[30:45] mixed coins before you can send those mixed coins. So that's the distinction that we're
[30:45] making between
[30:50] coin join transactions and private send transactions, uh, or what the wallet, what this wallet
[30:50] calls coin
[30:58] join mixing versus coin join send, which we don't have any of yet, uh, because
[30:58] we're still in the
[31:04] process here, but you can see all these transactions happening. Um, I do want to
[31:04] take a look at one of
[31:09] those. So let's go ahead and click on this, uh, right here. A lot of
[31:09] these are probably associated with our
[31:17] wallet. So DB five actually probably be easier to just go this way coin join
[31:17] mixing in process. Uh,
[31:24] let's see coin join mixing. Let's do this one right here. Cause it's already confirmed.
[31:28] And we'll take a look at this transaction ID right here, six, six, four, eight,
[31:28] zero,
[31:36] close that. And then we'll do a find on the page for that six, four,
[31:36] eight, zero. I saw it pop up for
[31:42] a second. Um, there it is six, four, eight, zero. So let's click on that.
[31:42] It identifies it as a coin
[31:52] join transaction. We'll click on the details here. And this is what a coin join
[31:52] transaction looks like,
[31:57] where you have, uh, coins on the left side as your inputs and here on
[31:57] your, here are your outputs.
[32:05] And this one has one confirmation and part, some of these inputs are my wallet.
[32:05] And some of these are,
[32:15] uh, other people's wallets. And, uh, some of the outputs are my wallet and some
[32:15] of the outputs are other
[32:23] people's wallets. So, but because they're the same amount, that's what gives you, that's what
[32:23] obfuscates
[32:29] the, the transaction history there. So people don't know which wallets, uh, belong to other
[32:29] people,
[32:35] obviously, uh, only I know that as this, as the wallet owner, only the wallet
[32:35] owner knows those things.
[32:41] Okay. So that's what the coin join, uh, transaction looks like. Now let's check our,
[32:41] um, our status again
[32:50] and see in the wallet, if we have two rounds sufficient to make a private
[32:50] send transaction
[32:56] or coin join send. So let's go to coin join inputs. We do have, uh,
[32:56] plenty of inputs that have two or more
[33:06] rounds of mixing. So this is going to be fine. Uh, let's go. Okay. Let's
[33:06] close this one for now
[33:15] and go back to the wallet and then let's do a coin join mix. So
[33:15] I'm going to go to the receive
[33:21] and I'm just going to put in a label called, um, uh, internal, internal wallet.
[33:29] And then, uh, I'll create that receiving address. So I'm going to send to myself,
[33:29] but I'm going to do a,
[33:38] uh, coin join send or a private send transaction. Uh, so let's say, uh, let's
[33:38] copy this address
[33:53] and then we'll go to the coin join tab and we'll put that as our
[33:53] destination. It pulls up the label
[33:59] that I gave and let's send 0.12 as one output. And we'll do another recipient.
[33:59] Um, actually we'll need
[34:09] another, uh, we'll need another internal wallet and say internal wallet two and create a
[34:09] new receiving
[34:21] address. Copy this. Okay. Going join. We'll put that in here and we'll say 0.23
[34:21] or 0.34, something like that.
[34:35] These could be any numbers. Um, Cause when you're doing a, when you're doing a
[34:35] send, when you're,
[34:41] when you're sending money to somebody, you need to send what they are expecting. So
[34:41] it might, this might
[34:45] be an invoice or something for, um, uh, a spritz invoice or, or something. Uh,
[34:45] so they're going to have
[34:52] an exact amount that you need to send. And so you would just put that
[34:52] as, as your destination, whether
[34:58] you have multiple recipients or one recipient, the concept is the same. Uh, it's going
[34:58] to look much
[35:05] different on the blockchain than a coin join transaction. Cause it's, it is just a
[35:05] different
[35:10] kind of thing. So we're going to, we're going to choose to do these two
[35:10] and we're going to send mixed
[35:14] funds. It's going to ask me for my passphrase. Do I remember it? Uh, okay.
[35:14] And then it's going to
[35:19] come up with a confirmation dialogue and it's going to say, uh, and by the
[35:19] way, this 0.12 plus 0.34 would be
[35:27] 0.46 total. Um, and so we do have that balance right here. You see our,
[35:27] our, our balance able to
[35:37] our coin join balance. That's just specific to the coin join balance. We have more
[35:37] in that are not mixed
[35:44] as well. Obviously we had two to start with. Um, so we're going to have,
[35:44] go ahead and click send. And
[35:49] when, when we were, we're going to click send, and then hopefully before I do
[35:49] that, I'm just going to
[35:56] actually refresh this, um, just to make sure that everything's good. Um, so we had,
[35:56] we have three in
[36:07] the list now and when we click send, we should have four soon. Okay. So
[36:07] I just, there it went, uh, I
[36:16] don't know if people saw it, but it's video. So you can find it. And
[36:16] then it should be in the bus now.
[36:21] It's right there. And if we click on this house, it's up here. Uh, let's
[36:21] look at what address it was.
[36:29] You see in the transactions tab of the wallet that we have this coin join
[36:29] send transaction
[36:36] to our internal wallet. I'm going to click on that and point, uh, let's see
[36:36] one, six, two, three.
[36:42] And here's that one, six, two, three transaction and click on that. And this is
[36:42] what the transaction
[36:52] looks like on the blockchain. So you got these 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1 and so
[36:52] forth. Uh, I think that, um,
[37:00] let's see 0.4, four, six, one, two, three, four. Okay. So it just, it rounded
[37:00] up, um, it sent 0.5 and
[37:12] that's how it works is you don't get dirty change back. Um, you end up
[37:12] spending a little bit more on
[37:17] that than, uh, than you typically would. So the, the transaction was a total of
[37:17] 0.04. Um, but yeah, again,
[37:28] that's the price you pay for privacy a little bit. Um, so anyway, yeah, that's,
[37:28] uh, there, you saw it,
[37:33] everything's working on the visualizer and, um, hopefully that was somewhat educational, uh, for,
[37:41] for people, both, uh, inside the dash, uh, you guys and, uh, people inside the
[37:41] dash community as well.
[37:48] For sure. Uh, and you saw that just confirm real quick there. Um, so yeah,
[37:48] anything else to say
[37:54] about this guys? I know, um, I know that it's, it's late where, where you
[37:54] are Taha, it's after midnight,
[37:59] so I won't keep you too late, but, um, any other, uh, comments or questions
[37:59] or anything from you guys?
[38:07] Yeah, right now we, we are very excited to visualize dash transactions and it's, it's
[38:07] really a fun to
[38:18] watch, especially coin join and private transactions happening in real time. So I, I really
[38:18] would like
[38:24] to suggest the community dash community to use a TXCT more often follow, follow your
[38:24] own addresses, uh,
[38:32] follow transactions. So you can just, uh, go to the, uh, search menu, enter your
[38:32] address and just keep
[38:38] following your transactions, uh, instead of watching boring explore explorers. So, so yeah, uh, and
[38:38] you'll see
[38:48] more, more amazing features, more, uh, coming up on TXCT for dash community and for
[38:55] uh, yeah, for, for, for the dash platform as well. So yeah, that, that's it.
[39:00] Yeah. And I also just wanted to say it's, it's, it's kind of nice having
[39:00] these stats right here.
[39:07] Uh, I, I find that I, I often need to remember like, what's the size
[39:07] of the blockchain? And this
[39:14] is a real fast way to just figure that out. Like the blockchain size is
[39:14] 39 gigabytes right now,
[39:20] close to 40 gigabytes. Um, and yeah, I find this to be a good, not
[39:20] only a good visualizer, but just,
[39:29] yeah, good for this little stats page. You can see also see the halving countdown.
[39:29] It's not exactly a
[39:33] halving in our case, but it, it looks like it's still accurate. I'm not sure
[39:33] where you're getting that
[39:38] data from, but it looks accurate to me. Um, and, uh, yeah, this is, this
[39:38] is great.
[39:46] We are getting that, we are getting that data from the dash node itself. I
[39:46] think we're calculating the
[39:52] block, uh, uh, yeah, the block average time to get that data.
[39:57] Well, I know that Joel is going to like, um, like this for, for that,
[39:57] um, educational, uh,
[40:05] that educational aspect as well. He's, he's the one that kind of, uh, got this,
[40:11] got this project started in the incubator. So, um, thanks to him for that. I
[40:11] think this is,
[40:17] this is good. And yeah, let's, uh, let's look forward to, we'll look forward to
[40:17] your proposal
[40:23] coming up to, to add more features. I personally would love to see a Maya
[40:23] house, um, just to see
[40:29] all the Maya transactions happening as well. Um, and, uh, platform obviously is, is going
[40:29] to be,
[40:37] cause we're going to get it, uh, going to be very cool to, to see
[40:37] that bridging between one blockchain
[40:43] to the other blockchain, uh, and be able to track your transactions like that. So,
[40:43] um, yeah, Calvin,
[40:51] you're going to have to create some, some cool new, uh, images for, for all
[40:51] of our other purposes,
[40:57] hopefully in the future. Awesome. All right. Thanks guys. Um, you're going to see the
[40:57] internet
[41:03] thing here for a minute here. Um, thanks for joining in, uh, on incubator weekly,
[41:03] let me just check and see
[41:10] if there are any other questions from, from people. Uh, people said definitely cool to
[41:10] watch. Um, thanks.
[41:18] Yeah. I haven't seen one punch saga here before. So thanks for joining in there.
[41:21] And, uh, we'll see you next time.
[41:24] Awesome.
[41:25] Yeah.
