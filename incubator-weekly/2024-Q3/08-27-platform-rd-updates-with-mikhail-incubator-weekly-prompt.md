## Transcript

[00:00] we're live welcome everyone uh it's a big day today we have platform launching onto
[00:11] mainnet uh soon so um we've got today with us anthony say that again it
[00:22] hasn't happened yet uh nope um the the packages have been released they're being adopted
[00:31] and i guess the longer version is that we do need a certain number of
[00:39] people to adopt the latest package which is platform version 1.1.1 um and if so
[00:51] within the next 20 something hours so actually i think the request is to do it within the next seven hours um so that the quorums can start forming properly
[00:59] and make sure that you don't get uh service banned that is the uh that's
[01:08] the that's the goal in the next seven or eight hours uh there is a
[01:14] little bit more time i think before the window uh the snapshot hits uh and if everything if if we've got enough nodes updated evo nodes specifically then uh platform
[01:23] will activate on mainnet uh if it doesn't within that time then i believe it's
[01:32] just a waiting game until until they do um but i think that there's a
[01:38] little bit of a question whether that will be successful or not do you know
[01:45] anything about this mikhail um yeah basically we need some amount of uh a decent amount of network upgraded to the dash platform to activate it and yeah we need
[01:54] to wait for certain quorums okay to happen okay um but today i think we
[02:04] have a little bit of a different topic in general we're going to be discussing
[02:12] just general updates from mikhail and team uh from the past month and i think looking forward into the next month uh do you want to go ahead and tell
[02:18] us what you're going to be discussing as a as a brief overview and then
[02:24] we'll jump into your screen share um uh let me check yeah uh let me
[02:35] let me get to the screen share actually okay that'll be easier um so uh yeah uh in the last month there there was a lot of updates a lot
[02:48] of a lot of research is being done um there are not there are not
[02:56] many changes uh on the ui ui side of the platform floor or any projects but there were quite researches uh as we as we get to the platform release
[03:06] we start we started uh trying some more low level uh functions of the dash
[03:12] platform and realizing how to how to put them together together um yeah so um
[03:25] so when you say researches uh research what what exactly um a lot of times so we we titled this uh platform r d research and development development a lot
[03:34] of times that uh the focus seems to be on r d with research but
[03:42] um what kind of research are you doing in platform and and and why yeah uh so let me let me show you so uh for certain platform explorer features
[03:52] for certain sdk uh sdk uh sdk's we need uh uh some functions uh from
[04:02] the platform that we execute and return data but uh there are different ways to retrieve the data and uh for example let me just show you an example um
[04:14] we have another entities and there is a balance um right now platform explorer uh
[04:21] calculates balances from the uh like itself with it it's recalculated it's it's not acquiring
[04:30] uh the uh network itself like the dapi and uh yeah so we've been searching
[04:42] uh a way to execute those that those grpc queries on the dapi and uh how to interact with them uh because it's not really uh it's not quite uh
[04:53] easy to work with jrpc because uh uh it is a library from google uh
[05:04] which basically makes some pre-generated uh clients and uh yeah um so why isn't that why isn't that easy to work with if if if the so my understanding is
[05:12] with grpc you have a bunch of so-called proto files they're text files that describe
[05:19] the interface um that you can interact with in a generic way so that different
[05:26] languages can then use that same uh protocol file and then generate clients like you
[05:33] said so you can generate a javascript client or a rust client or whatever different
[05:40] client uh for your for the language that you're using so if these are auto-generated
[05:47] um clients what's difficult about it and are you talking specifically about a browser environment or what what part of it is difficult uh well um no not really much
[06:02] people uh have already tried that like uh there are no uh code examples to
[06:10] like there are content examples but uh when i'm doing it uh on the backend on the backend side uh like it's it's kind of different because uh there are
[06:20] maybe some missing queries uh for example we needed a query for total credits on
[06:28] the platform but uh it wasn't there in the uh in the platform code source
[06:38] uh like in the jrpc uh some recently edited uh yeah but there are were some years that we also been fixing up and uh trying to integrate it uh
[06:46] in the proper way uh yeah we also uh tested the package called jrpc url
[06:58] this is something uh very similar to c url uh aka curl uh which allows you to send some requests to http service so it's the same tool but it
[07:05] allows you to fire requests to jrpc interface just like uh we have a dapi
[07:14] it's a command it's a command line uh tool that uh does the same thing
[07:23] as curl does for normal urls but instead of sending um json data for for example in the payload in the body uh you're sending yeah something like that okay
[07:32] so it's okay so do you have do you want to show us that or
[07:36] is that something that you plan to show or just um i can show um but i need to uh change my share screen and so this would be this
[07:46] would make it possible for you to um do these grpc calls um so the
[07:57] evo nodes are running a grpc back-end service and to interact with that you have
[08:09] these different clients the grpc curl uh or grp curl however uh that's spoken is one of those clients but you wouldn't use that from a web browser for example
[08:16] um you'd use that from just a normal terminal right you anthony have you had
[08:28] much experience while he's looking that up do you have much experience with using grpc uh or particularly in the in the web world no no i've never i mean
[08:36] like i'm i'm aware of it and when my first job at stepzen i was
[08:45] working with a bunch of like old school google api devs so they all spoke grpc in their sleep i'm sure but um yeah i mean i came up through
[08:54] rest and then this whole like trpc thing happened but grpc is one thing that
[09:00] i've never really worked with directly yeah okay um michael do you know why because
[09:09] i know that um i know that platform and evo node master nodes in general
[09:21] they they expose both grpc endpoints and um json rpc endpoints do you know why they don't expose all of it or more of it through normal um rpc uh
[09:35] normal g json rpc um yeah i think that not all um dapy methods were
[09:47] like tested uh in all the way and i think platform team just aware that there could be bugs or some security flaws so they disabled uh all of the
[09:54] queries except those that are really required for platform to work so yeah i think
[10:03] they will enable it later after finalize sdk and stuff okay all right did you
[10:11] uh we haven't let me put your yeah one second yeah one second back on
[10:16] okay i'll wait for you for a minute yeah once yeah one second i will
[10:20] copy here some sample trying to find you pull up the docs while you're doing
[10:32] that um i guess um yeah right proof falls uh i remember that so basically basically you need to prepare a proper uh request param which comes uh from the
[11:13] grpc protocol file okay should i share your screen now um yeah sure okay okay
[11:25] zoom in a little bit and then you use it something like that oh i'm
[11:42] seeing uh your terminal is that what you're trying to share because i don't see
[11:50] anything yet yeah yeah so uh it's basically missing the protocol file let me see if you can just copy it up and just copy it up i'm seeing a
[12:01] screen that looks to be frozen really yeah same um okay let me just and we can uh we don't have to necessarily go into this part i i just
[12:19] thought uh we could show it if you had it ready but um we can um we could go on to some of the other things that you had to
[12:28] discuss if you wanted to it's got a new picture going i'll add this to
[12:35] the stage yeah i believe uh i don't know uh i don't think it will work because uh i'm seeing your screen now yeah so okay anyway uh yeah so
[12:43] there was quite research around jrpc around sdk how the platform works um and we
[12:55] also uh digged into the way how different platform works and uh uh and also
[13:13] we think about dashmetless setup as well i checked how to deploy um the platform uh without the dashmate it's kind of possible um there are few steps that needed
[13:24] to could be done in order to have those dashmetless set up um so there
[13:34] are some templates uh which uh right now in the dashmate uh hardcoded and yeah
[13:46] it makes it harder to uh to use them without the dashmate yeah so i made the first part uh like this research um but i think like combining these
[13:56] things together shouldn't take much and i'm going to test it uh on my own
[14:00] infrastructure um yeah so people can read the config files and they can always repeat
[14:10] it uh on their setups so this is um a setup without dashmate using config
[14:18] files on your own infrastructure yeah yeah uh it will probably use some uh dashmate
[14:25] files uh to generate the templates but it will be always separate like uh all
[14:34] of the platform components will be run separately like from the without dashmate okay uh yeah so um uh we also did some urgent work uh which uh which was
[14:47] needed uh for example we fixed uh the inside ui uh our developer owl before
[14:58] you want he managed to fix this fix this issue there was a year in
[15:07] the client library uh on the client side yeah and uh we also worked uh like oh me myself i worked on the dashmate uh during the platform really release
[15:19] uh like when it uh finally came up came out i was supporting the dashmate
[15:26] uh fixing some bugs we also added one very important comment which called uh dashmate
[15:34] doctor which basically just pulls out everything about your master node and puts it into
[15:43] into the tar archive uh archive or i don't know okay so yeah it contains everything it contains logs it contains all the conflicts uh but we also remove some
[15:53] sensitive data like uh api keys private keys and stuff like that we only keep
[16:03] like external ip uh protex uh and some public stuff yeah but in the future
[16:12] we want to make it completely anonymous so that you can send it and nobody can discuss discuss um the master node owners so that's uh that would be like
[16:23] log files that you're generating and filtering for privacy um and yeah how would this
[16:30] can how does this command compare to just something like the status command isn't that
[16:36] isn't the status command supposed to yeah yeah the status command uh it just returns
[16:44] to you the overall data uh it doesn't perform any checks uh like initially we thought that uh would be good idea to make a comment like dashmate doctor it
[16:51] will uh show you the most generic errors which uh cannot be caught by dashmate
[16:59] status for example you don't have some port open or you you don't have actually
[17:06] this means how status shows that but there could be different areas like uh you're
[17:15] missing some indexes for example or you're i don't know some errors in the log so initially we thought that it would be good idea to make some make a
[17:22] comment that will just make some health check um of your note yeah and show
[17:33] you some info uh in the first version we uh with like agreed to just put everything in logs uh so that master and donors can send the log file
[17:42] to the dcg support team and they help this in some in case some urgent
[17:50] actions like uh network stall and stuff like that uh let me show you how
[18:03] this uh uh stuff looks like um great um okay i will do the entire
[18:15] screen for this time um yeah so basically uh archive looks like that it's just a tar um tar package uh compressed with a gun zip uh if we unpack
[18:27] it uh we see folders for each of the service and also we have dashmate
[18:37] conflict which as you can see uh hides even your home home folder so so just let me back up a little bit you're in a folder called dashmate report
[18:45] 2024 with the date is this something that the that the docker command outputs does
[18:54] it yeah folder yeah uh let me check if i have my node running and i can actually can just run the comment yarn dashmate doctor yeah yeah you will
[19:02] you will tap it without yarn because it's my development uh okay so uh you
[19:11] see uh it just uh asks you if you want to make a report and
[19:19] also uh tells you about every information that that we collect and that web update some sensitive data and where the tar i have will be saved into if we
[19:26] make if we do yes it will pull some data and make a where i was uh and dashmate the area it's it's here so we should get into dashmate
[19:45] yeah here it is okay so yeah let me unpack it real quick just check
[20:00] it live uh yeah so when we step into the this folder we can see uh each folder for each service and uh we also can see the the conflict
[20:12] uh with obfuscated info like users uh users uh are not shown obfuscated all but
[20:19] all the passwords obfuscated and stuff like that there is also a dashmate version and
[20:29] uh the system uh the system info about operating system which is running uh on this machine where you're running they even know it contains some info about uh cpu
[20:36] about the memory about docker uh host machine um yeah so we limited uh the
[20:49] info that we extract from from from your machine so yeah because the library that
[20:59] we used a really fbi library fbi yes yeah yeah because there are so many
[21:06] many infos uh every serial keys uh of your hardware every like everything when we
[21:12] saw that we was kind of kind of amazed of it yeah so if we go into the each folder you we can see uh some important data uh for
[21:22] example for core we have all the logs uh from the docker container uh we
[21:33] have worms uh quorum's information uh information about uh connected peers we also have in
[21:41] docker um docker like info about docker container for the each of the sir for the each service uh yeah blockchaining for best chain log basically this uh info needed
[21:49] for debugging uh yeah yeah when you know if something really bad happens uh in
[21:56] the network this is will be very very important okay that'd be happy for the
[22:04] tender dash there are same set of the rpcs that we also pull like consensus state peers also and stuff like that yeah now is this is this docker uh
[22:13] doctor not docker but um dashmate doctor command is this already packaged in the 1.1
[22:22] version yes yes yes we already merged it in and is the output that it that it gives right now is it private enough that somebody could say send this
[22:30] uh archived folder uh zip folder to dcg to have them diagnose a problem without
[22:39] any privacy concerns or not yet um yeah i think so there are only public
[22:46] info like external your expert external ip your protex hash which is already available in in the blockchain in the sml um in the master note list um so i
[22:54] think it's fine uh so we we had like there was like uh sensitive information
[23:07] like your username um your private keys you know uh sure but of course you know if if if you have a discord handle and you're sending it to dc
[23:16] yeah dcg will know which node you operate uh people should be aware of that
[23:24] and then if they combine that with something like a service like mno watch if
[23:30] you have multiple nodes they might be able to connect to those as well just through cluster analysis just yeah just so that people know uh what makes sense yeah
[23:37] we will improve that in the future version yeah but we will keep it like
[23:44] it's it's like minimal viable product um yeah so very cool comment that should help
[23:56] us uh really a lot especially in the discord when people i don't know if
[24:02] people are going to put it into discord but yeah anyway just a question about one of the things that you mentioned before did you um do you know if
[24:10] if the insight ui has been redeployed um at the dcgs um insight.dash.org yes i
[24:22] did i did it today uh so i released yeah yeah i did a release
[24:28] today of inside ui i haven't tested it yet and so for the same reason i haven't pinged latte yet so i want to ensure that it is running uh
[24:36] in my infrastructure yeah okay so i will make i will test it today i
[24:47] think and we will see if it's working maybe some another change will be needed
[24:54] but we will figure this out as well and so the the api and what what caught what the impetus was for this whole thing was dash central needed um
[25:01] a bug fixed on the api i i don't know i don't know what the
[25:09] central needed but i know that a new version uh wasn't working and i was actually uh releasing it last time um so basically there are there were changes in
[25:19] the network like uh when they edit the master nodes and stuff like that there
[25:26] was a dashboard leap uh there was changes in dashboard which needed to be depleted
[25:33] and they have a new version in the dashboard but it wasn't updated in the inside so updated uh the dashboard loop inside the inside but inside ui stopped working
[25:40] for some reason uh yeah so and it was like that for like maybe half
[25:52] a year okay all right well uh what other what other what other things have
[25:58] you been working on then outside of uh dashmate and insight um yeah let's get
[26:06] to the most interesting part the platform explorer there were really really quite work um
[26:08] one second i will share my screen so how many um how many developers do
[26:23] you have working on this now um pretty much pretty much we have i would say three uh three to five uh active developers working with me some of them
[26:31] working partially some of them uh work uh full time uh yeah so we increase
[26:43] team on the platform so right now we have two front-end developer uh and we
[26:55] have one back-end guy which really really helps us um i already mentioned him uh when he fixed the inside ui uh very good guy very talented uh and yeah
[27:05] he's doing very very well um yeah so this is all open source right the
[27:13] the front end the back end the indexers all of it's open source so anybody can run this infrastructure if they sure private explorer um that you know you're not
[27:20] doing any logs i'm guessing but um if somebody wants to have their own instance
[27:27] so just a couple questions before you get started on this i see actually i've
[27:33] actually um missed one guy and there is also a new ux new ux designer
[27:41] which uh works on the ux interface of the platform explorer and he did very very great work uh about refining this ui interface into more modern so there is
[27:50] a new design um uh sorry i interrupted you this is not the design that
[27:56] you're talking about you're saying there is a new one coming yeah yeah i see
[28:05] that you have it says platform version 1.1.0 does that mean that the infrastructure that
[28:10] you're running is running platform version 1.1 or that's the work version that um most of testnet is on or what what is that because i know we have a
[28:18] yeah yeah 1.1 now yeah this version is the version uh is the version that
[28:22] running the platform explorer i haven't updated it yet to what to v 1.1.1 okay
[28:32] so it's compatible but you know it's not uh like maybe it's better but i think it's mostly contains some dashboard stuff and um so it's the version that you're
[28:40] running got it yeah yeah yeah it's the version that that uh platform explorer is
[28:46] running on okay and then dash and then the dash testnet 51 that's um where's
[28:55] that uh that's the latest uh testnet it is coming from the tender dash uh rpc so it's up to date uh with my uh dashmate full node full full
[29:05] eva node okay so i have my own node yeah so let me show you
[29:16] what we what we've got uh we totally redesigned all of the pages uh what we have now we we have pretty good uh homepage but we like really really
[29:32] a lot of info on other pages for example in blocks we have just just
[29:41] a table uh if we go for example for some transactions yeah uh it is
[29:51] not clear what was sent uh in this transaction and yeah it's like not matching
[30:01] uh the homepage that uh we have right now so and we like thought about
[30:11] this with designer he came up uh with a new fresh design uh which personally i think uh more modern that we have now and can attract more users uh
[30:19] like it's more easy that was great it's it looks looks looks like much good
[30:31] much better um yeah the status page was uh reworked uh uh we thought about this trending list we added uh the buttons so that you can uh check more
[30:41] data right away uh uh on the data contracts pages we added a slider which
[30:53] will show different uh data contracts submitted in the network uh these uh system ones
[31:02] which are hard coded in the platform code uh this one is uh data contract of my platform store but i really want to add also dash money applications and
[31:10] maybe people will start uh will start uh doing some other just released that sorry
[31:19] uh that's uh development so yeah yes um and just by the way i as soon as this gets onto mainnet and is stable i i would really like to
[31:33] have a dash incubator uh data model and make our incubator claims process um sure
[31:42] sure i thought about that yeah i have some sort of some topic uh related to that uh uh we will get into it okay uh yeah also mobile um
[31:53] on our data pages we uh edit some top which is it looks like some
[32:03] game ranking yeah you know uh yeah uh yeah also there is now a copy
[32:14] button which allows you to easily uh copy the data and you don't need to select it and like it's easier uh uh what we have else uh on the
[32:26] validators pages yeah we we left it as uh kind of this but we also
[32:32] like we worked it uh uh to watch the new design in case anybody's wondering
[32:39] about the term validators um do you want that that is synonymous with uh evolution
[32:47] master nodes or evo nodes and it's just the term that typical proof of stake
[32:55] uh blockchains use is the term validators um but it is synonymous with evo nodes yeah if it might make sense to put that in parentheses or something i don't
[33:01] know yeah quiz already raised this question or maybe we want to into the proof of stake world by just calling them validators i don't know what what do you
[33:12] think i partially partially agree with that because yeah it makes sense for the users
[33:21] uh that goes to this website but on the other hand in the on the
[33:27] platform level it's called validators on the tender dash level and what i'm doing here is i'm just parsing what put that what what what's in the code you know
[33:35] so it's like on more low lower level than than users see yeah so yeah
[33:46] it it's it's a good idea i don't know we will think about that uh okay for sure for sure so yeah uh i think what we left to do
[33:56] uh regarding this new design is uh construct a better transaction details interface so when
[34:04] you get to the particular transaction page uh it could be seen like straight right
[34:11] away all the info just like we have you know on the other scan when we uh get to the come on i'm not i'm not a bot uh yeah
[34:22] when you get to the transaction hash you can see all the data right away
[34:28] and then you can see the details of your transactions what's the function so i think it should be something like that when we get to the specific uh transaction
[34:36] we should see all of the data happening we should see for for some transactions
[34:44] like top up like deposits uh we should see a transaction leading to the l1
[34:52] blockchain to the core chain and stuff like that you know i was hoping for that myself so yeah and we also need uh some debug data like the signatures
[34:58] the set log proof so if you're a developer you just copy that and just
[35:07] test it in your with your code yeah uh actually homepage i think uh alexei
[35:17] already uh made uh implemented the new design of the home page uh yeah so all we'll have to do is just complete the other you can see it's already
[35:27] live nice but it's not it but it's not merged yet i don't know but
[35:36] i think this will be oh yeah also the other pages also was a bit
[35:41] and not all of the changes are there but but the basic the basic design is already on all of the pages this is so cool yeah it looks like
[35:50] great progress yeah i like the little light up in the top left corner yeah
[35:57] let's see we work so hard uh so i would like to thank you i would like to thank you uh um before i forget to ask do you know
[36:07] what your plans are what your timeline is as far as getting the mainnet uh
[36:14] network supported on this because right now it's just testnet as far as i know yeah uh there is already a switch uh so as long like as far as
[36:21] as as as soon as uh platform will be live and working in the bayonet
[36:29] i will just edit straight right away okay so that shouldn't take too long no
[36:37] no we will we will have a platform for com uh connected to the mainnet and then we will have testnet.platformexplorer.com which will serve the testnet data we will also
[36:47] have some different devnets i believe uh uh then it will be also listed here
[36:54] so they'll be on different urls then yeah yeah each each one uh yeah so there were also a lot of a lot of backend work um our backend developer
[37:10] owl really really work hard and he already finished 23 tasks uh in the dash
[37:19] incubator and he started just oh i think it was in in june yeah middle of the june so he's very very pure performance uh so keep working bro yeah
[37:31] i see him yeah so what he did he he was working on the backend
[37:39] side of the project uh he implemented some important uh postgre postgreSQL queries like uh
[37:47] average transactions per seconds uh for alexei to show on the front end he also shown the validator proposer proposed blocks by the way if you didn't see if you
[37:55] get to the validator you can now see a transaction or sorry a chart which
[38:02] shows you activity of your validator uh amount of proposed blocks for the timeline that
[38:11] you can choose so you can see if you know this offline you can see when when it went offline and stuff like that so he implemented this thing and
[38:25] then we also um worked on the release workflow and he prepared uh git action
[38:34] workflows to make a releases so right now we have a releases uh in the
[38:41] platform explorer repository where you can see all of the changes that is happening this is the first release and this contains all of the changes that uh this git
[38:49] action git action could find uh so but next releases will already only show the
[38:57] differences between the versions you know um yeah i saw those the first three releases
[39:03] come in yesterday or something really quickly yeah how how quickly do you plan on
[39:11] doing what's your release cadence plans um sorry what you mean um how often do you plan to do releases in the future um i don't know that i think
[39:20] depends uh on the major features actually uh we did uh release uh like this
[39:29] workflow in such way that if we merge something to the master uh it goes
[39:36] straight like it's just the back end changes you know or some front end changes if we merge it to master it just goes straight like that but if we
[39:43] need uh some breaking changes if there are there were some breaking changes like some
[39:49] changes in the schema which requires re-indexing on the platform explorer um then we do
[39:57] it while the releasing of the new version so then when deployment is going and dropping the database and we're thinking so it will be a fast i think development
[40:06] uh workflow but if there are breaking changes we will just push a new version
[40:12] but maybe we will do more frequent so we just uh implemented it uh haven't
[40:18] really played a lot of with it we will see how it works basically uh the versions that you see here uh released you can also see on the platform
[40:25] floor uh so it goes straight from the package version so you can always see
[40:34] which version is live uh maybe it's good idea also is show the git hash
[40:45] uh but we didn't do this here okay um yeah i have a question before i forget again um joel was wondering if there's any update on wallet connect do
[40:53] you want to speak to that uh yeah uh we've been talking with joel about
[41:03] that and uh i've seen that they made some some changes to each utx you uh you take so coins and actually i think joel also said that uh one
[41:13] wallet already implemented some bitcoin protocols yeah but uh we didn't really think about that
[41:22] yet because there was a platform release we will get into that after the platform
[41:28] release where there is a lot of first stuff that we need to do in
[41:35] different projects so yeah um so have we done have we done the work that's needed on our side and we're just waiting for them to merge something in or
[41:41] what's what's the status i think uh we're waiting for for us uh like i
[41:52] see there are some code uh i need just open the pull request as far as i know there are not much changes that needs to be done like one
[41:58] day work uh as joel said um okay it shouldn't take really much time like
[42:06] but something like adding the different it's just yeah it's just sorry yeah it's just it just requires attention okay yeah so yeah we will do it uh after the
[42:15] platform release okay and speaking of that do you have any do you have any
[42:23] tips for people who are setting up their evo nodes because that is like a
[42:31] time critical thing do you have any kind of uh tutorial that they can that you can refer them to if they don't already know um um um um yeah
[42:39] we actually made a one um uh cool uh yeah so there is another guy
[42:57] called uh his name is lexel his nickname is lexel um he he experienced developer oh yeah and he likes trying out some new stuff and he also uh he
[43:08] also likes to write articles and i asked him if he wanted just decompose all
[43:17] of the dashmate stuff and just made a proper full article which uh full guide
[43:26] like tutorial which lets you just spin up a dashmate with all of the comments and install the comments is this a guy is this a guy that's like in
[43:31] the dash community or is this a guy that's in the broader crypto community and
[43:36] and you like recruited him this is the first thing that he's done with dash
[43:44] or what do you know yeah actually um all of the people that right now in my team they were all invited by our eux designer i would like to
[43:52] thank him very much he really helped me like doing things uh he's not just
[44:02] like doing designs he also knew he also know some contacts he also he's very
[44:09] motivated he always like come on bro it's like yeah and what's it what's his uh his handle is black mirror designer okay so black mirror designer thank you for
[44:18] um building out the team there yeah so he suggested me all of the guys
[44:28] that uh like it's uh it's the owl it's uh lexel it's uh dan craft shoe which is the second uh front-end developer um so yeah three guys i think
[44:36] okay let's scroll through this slowly so that people can see the so basically what
[44:44] it shows you is uh first is this is in the production like what is
[44:52] master note and how what is the sections in this article uh it's basically uh
[44:58] it's basically was broken down into four parts first it's just installing your local wallet
[45:04] and securing it then preparing and configuring the server then installing the dashmate and then finally running it yeah so if you go through it you can see that there
[45:12] are screenshots and all of the steps that need to be done um uh this
[45:21] is this was uh written on ubuntu but i think it's uh doesn't really matter uh it should work for any system uh yeah so it shows you that you
[45:30] need to save some wallet and make a backups uh how to get your projects
[45:38] hash when also you send a collateral uh how to create a your server your vps um that you need to do ssh key uh need to do proper public
[45:47] key authentication because we already seen that uh quizzes note i think was hacked because
[45:57] some people use uh passwords but there are a lot of people really doing a
[46:07] lot of brute forces and yeah so it's very important i think uh that you
[46:12] said the public pubkey authentication because it's basically yeah turning down brain like this vector
[46:21] of attack uh also for the windows what you should do uh essentially uh configuring
[46:32] the firewall enabling swap reboot and then we go to the installing dashmate step uh which uh which yeah it links to the packages which are available in the platform
[46:41] releases section so to install you can just install this that package yeah uh then
[46:56] goes the section about starting here dashmate setup uh making a transaction a transaction it shows you how to go through all of the steps and how to make a
[47:02] transaction here you insert your collateral transaction in for your your addresses which are in
[47:10] your local wallet and not in the server that is private key uh yeah here
[47:19] we see yes dashmate composes a registration command that you need to put into dash
[47:22] core wallet uh once we get it uh once we get it uh we can
[47:36] go through the rest of uh the stuff also we explained it the zero ssl step because it is very important for people uh also i would like to mention
[47:43] that zero ssl is not working for the for some restricted subnets uh for example
[47:50] for russian subnets uh you will not be able to set up a zero ssl
[47:58] but you can always yeah that seems like a big problem because zero ssl is
[48:05] the only option for getting a certificate from a of course of course best certificate authority uh for an ip address for sure but you can always uh create this
[48:14] certificate in some somewhere else like uh separately from the dashmate and then use file
[48:22] on disk we also describe this that this section how to do that um instead
[48:30] of zero ssl so you either use zero ssl or either you either you either you use file on disk okay yeah in the end uh dashmate will tell you
[48:38] that everything set up uh successfully then you just launch it it will start all
[48:46] of the services and then you can see that everything is all good also everything
[48:56] can see in the end uh you can see dashmate uh your dashmate content in
[49:05] your dashboard wallet or on the platform explorer website yeah this looks very comprehensive um have you tried this was this tested on testnet or how how did he um
[49:12] how did he come up with all this all these steps uh has he been he learned of the stuff okay yeah he learned of the stuff uh how the
[49:22] dashmate work how network works uh so he he has a lot of background in
[49:32] his yeah not that type young type of guys but he he he's not he may be not not that like experience but he has a lot of uh knowledge
[49:41] in his mind uh yeah so he he also okay with the terminal you know
[49:50] that all of the stuff linux uh his linux user itself himself sorry and yeah so he dug up all of the stuff basically broken down every part of this
[49:58] process and yeah and composed uh this article he also willing to work uh on
[50:08] some next articles just like for um for example we want to do uh article
[50:16] about dash platform how dash platform works how how you how to use it how to submit documents how to submit data contracts how to work with it um these
[50:24] uh articles exist in two languages in the english and in russian so we cover
[50:33] like two communities at least uh which is good uh which is good uh yeah
[50:41] we also receive some traffic uh by the way when we posted it into some russian uh blog website there will be some comments so it also increasing uh the
[50:52] appearance of dash um yeah so yeah uh what else uh um yeah actually we
[51:15] still doing a lot of researches for example i've been researching stuff about uh um
[51:30] about dash platform and how to like not exactly this platform but uh we right now we have kind of limited functionality to to use this sdk which is uh
[51:42] like like the official dash sdk on the front end because of their bundle size
[51:49] bundle size it's pretty big it's it was reduced uh in the recently in the recent builds yeah it was reduced to 36 megabytes which is still too much for
[52:00] the front end yeah i was i was noticing that we were talking about that
[52:10] um before the show uh so by the way i don't know i don't know
[52:14] if this is actually technically the official sdk anymore i think the rust sdk has taken over official uh sdk but uh yeah but but the front but for the
[52:24] front end you can always you can only use uh the dash 36 megabyte i
[52:36] know yeah i i know that um 36 megabytes uh 4.1.4 uh 4.1.1 that's unpacked
[52:42] size yeah i'm actually seeing it so if you go if you go to bundle
[52:50] phobia it's actually smaller if you go to uh yeah we got a question in the chat what are some of the potential solutions to the ssl issue over the
[53:05] coming years wasn't there something related to ipfs but only worked on chromium browsers maybe getting things mixed up yeah he's talking about um he's talking about lib s uh
[53:22] lib what's it called uh lib p2p that's the ipfs library that um we've looked
[53:30] into a little bit in the past about how to yeah part of it yeah
[53:39] but i think he is mixing up things a little bit that's not the ssl issue that was that's connecting directly to master nodes uh to get um network data
[53:49] but yeah yeah i can see okay uh let's get if you want to say
[53:58] anything more about that um michael you might have some more knowledge about halawi's question
[54:01] um or or did you want to move on um could you repeat the question
[54:10] is it about the cell on the dapi potential solutions for the ssl issue over
[54:19] the coming years so that the the ssl issue is that um it's there's only
[54:27] one provider zero ssl that gives certificate authority um certs that are recognized by typical browsers um and there's only one service that does that for ip addresses but um
[54:37] then there was some then he says there wasn't there something related to ipfs but
[54:43] it works only in chromium browsers i think those are okay okay let me let
[54:50] me answer that question real quick yeah it's there is i think there is one one way to avoid those ssl searches but uh that is dapi https interface is
[55:02] just a transfer that can be switched with uh anything else later and i know
[55:12] i know a protocol called web transfer which was uh just recently just recently like
[55:21] uh implemented in uh in major browsers it's kind of new protocol which is made over http free um i believe yeah uh and it basically allows you to put
[55:31] your certificate hatches when you are connecting to the servers instead of public infrastructure that
[55:36] we have like all with this ssl stuff uh i think there should be a
[55:44] research towards towards this protocol and just check how can we wait i think it's
[55:53] it should be possible to you know use uh platform note pub public keys uh as uh you know um as a as a trusted source like you know you
[56:01] can get uh something from this sml to check the public uh public keys and
[56:10] and make uh a connection a secure connection without involving the ssl certificates so i think it should be possible we just like the platform team just made the first
[56:18] version with the ssl yes yeah okay well we'll look forward to that in the
[56:23] future sounds like something that uh we can continue to okay yeah so basically the
[56:29] problem with the dash sdk on the front end that it's still too big it's still too big 13 megabytes it also not like it's stable but for example the
[56:38] extension environment uh i've been trying to put it into the extension environment it doesn't
[56:43] work reliably uh for example it downloads really a lot of data so it syncs
[56:55] uh to the network uh from the block one and uh it requires all of
[57:01] the transactions happening on your wallet and all of the like block headers which i think overall takes from 15 megabytes to 100 megabytes when you're working in extension you
[57:09] cannot save that uh much amount of data yeah and stuff like that so i
[57:21] think we need a better sdk to work with the platform transactions yeah yep we
[57:29] have actually um we've started on that um on on my side we have a library that we're trying to get the very first basic identity registration done and we
[57:39] were looking into wasm dpp we had a long conversation with you as well mikhail
[57:43] so thanks for that um if you open a new tab uh on the bundle
[57:56] phobia site and go to um or just not that one so just just open
[58:05] a new bundle phobia tab yeah yep and then and then type in at dash
[58:10] evo slash wasm hyphen dpp nope not that one yep this seems to be most of the size of the sdk and it's come down significantly i'm not sure how
[58:28] but from the last version that i was looking at which was 1.1.0 um i
[58:33] was looking this morning and it's come come down significantly from there so you we
[58:39] talked a little bit before the stream not sure exactly what was removed from these
[58:47] packages that made them almost half as big they're still bigger than they need to
[58:55] be obviously but a significant improvement so did you figure out we were talking maybe
[59:02] about source maps being they maybe having removed source maps or something like that but something to look into we have to last time we tested this wasm dpp library
[59:08] that wasn't working for us so that was yeah i think they removed it i
[59:15] think they removed it because i remember seeing it uh in this directory removed source
[59:22] maps yeah source maps i think that uh reduced the size uh okay of the
[59:26] final wasm dpp bundle um we'll have to test this again um see if it
[59:35] works for us but yeah that's that's the main package that we need in order
[59:38] to yeah so yeah yeah and to make new decentralized applications we need that because
[59:50] uh putting that that into the client side like if you're just a regular user
[59:56] and to run platform queries you just wait for syncing code to the platform network
[60:04] and uh that just not that efficient yeah you don't you don't want people waiting for it for a minute you know depending on their connection so to just to
[60:11] research that like the way to interact uh with dash platform dash platform functions uh
[60:18] dash platform features from the front end so i picked up my existing uh project
[60:29] called uh trend make dot dev uh website and uh we talked with our devs uh for a little bit and we decided to move some data from it uh
[60:37] to the dash platform oh no something was broken i i did i didn't know
[60:44] that like i don't know what what happened i think with it's pretty ah what
[60:53] uh i think that was connection problem yeah um so yeah what we thought is that we could put potentially all of the new updates that that we have all
[60:59] of the updates that we have uh into the dash platform we can also put
[61:07] the team and stuff like that all of all of this stuff and i want to do it like a playground uh for interacting with the dash platform at least
[61:15] uh we have something uh so that we already can like make some and like
[61:26] it will it will uh like it will require this dash sdk research stuff because
[61:35] yeah here on the front end we wanna for regular users we wanna just show people villages data from the network uh if you're for example admin uh you want
[61:44] to create some updates uh you need to push it somehow into the network we
[61:53] also want to do a separate page like called tasks uh yeah so if people
[62:04] so it's something so my idea so if some cool developers come to my website and he just leads through the through the sections he gets to the task list
[62:10] and he can see some available tasks available tasks to just start doing right away
[62:17] yeah so i think i think it's a good idea uh to put everything in
[62:24] the dash platform because it will it will be there forever nobody could just delete all of all of my info that i uh been posted like uh from a
[62:34] website for example you know and it will work basically forever so yeah and yeah okay cool um yep i think we we're both kind of on the same page
[62:48] there be very cool we need we need to have some real world um applications
[62:56] on dash platform before i can recommend anybody else using dash platform i wouldn't i
[63:02] would like to make sure that it's working for my own use case in real
[63:09] production and that we're relying on that we're relying on it to never be wiped for example that's the kind of thing that um will give me the confidence to
[63:16] share this for other people like like for example the people that we've introduced it
[63:22] to already briefly anthony um we've got to get going soon you said you you've
[63:29] got a time uh you've got a a schedule to to get to so did you have anything else to add anthony and then we'll wrap it up nope this
[63:35] is um great stuff michael and just keep it up killing the game over here
[63:44] yep cool all right well um thank you everybody for tuning in and thanks michael
[63:49] for giving us this uh update on what you've been working on what you plan to be doing in the near future here and uh everybody else get those nodes
[63:55] up and running and let's get this hopefully next week we'll be on mainnet um
[64:01] if if not you know i guess we'll we'll figure that out but that's the plan thanks everybody more eminent yep more eminent yeah bye everyone
