## Chapters

### 00:00 – 05:00 | Opening Remarks and Incubator Goals

In these first minutes, the hosts welcome everyone back after a break and set the stage for the conversation. They clarify the purpose of the Dash Incubator, explaining how it offers a place for new developers to become involved in Dash through smaller, manageable tasks. By providing guidance and modest bounties, the Incubator helps contributors learn the ropes before making larger commitments. This collaborative environment allows them to refine skills while gradually taking on more responsibility in the Dash ecosystem.

They also highlight their main focus: creating tools that empower web developers to integrate Dash efficiently. The discussion moves toward the challenge of getting important low-level solutions into a user-friendly format. The speakers note that traditionally, essential Dash features have been tucked away, requiring full nodes or specialized knowledge to access. By sketching out the overarching mission of the Incubator, they introduce how the RPC Proxy tool can address these concerns and further the project's goals.

### 05:00 – 10:00 | Developer Onboarding and Proposal Experiences

Here, the conversation shifts to the complexities developers face when they first experiment with Dash. The speakers recall how daunting it once was to set up proposals or interact with Dash Core functionality, especially for those who lack direct involvement with major teams like the Dash Core Group. They underline that the Incubator aims to bridge this gap, welcoming newer contributors who want to work on smaller tasks before committing to larger roles or proposals.

By sharing personal experiences, they emphasize the importance of accessible tooling. The hosts recount times when lacking a straightforward interface led to abandoned projects or stalled integrations. Despite solid libraries and thorough documentation, new developers still needed a friendlier path to ramp up quickly. They convey their vision that improved resources, combined with an iterative approach, will enable more robust and successful proposals that can gain community support.

### 10:00 – 15:00 | Incubator Deliverables and Emerging Dash Libraries

During this segment, the hosts reflect on the various libraries and frameworks emerging from the Incubator. While several of these initiatives—like DIP-based solutions and merchant tooling—are powerful, they mention how many remain hidden without a user interface or wider adoption. They acknowledge that it takes considerable effort to translate back-end achievements into polished front-end applications, which is why ongoing development can seem slow or incomplete.

The conversation highlights the importance of aligning developer incentives with Dash network priorities. The hosts explain how they revamped the Incubator's structure to grant each strategist their own proposal, ensuring clearer accountability and alignment with the Masternode owners' wishes. This evolution reflects lessons learned from previous efforts that stalled due to funding or strategic shifts. As a result, they see the RPC Proxy project as an example of how individual initiative can expedite progress toward more user-friendly Dash tools.

### 15:00 – 20:00 | Introduction to RPC Concepts and Use Cases

Shifting focus, the speakers introduce the concept of Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) and how they underpin blockchain interactions. They illustrate how developers typically call Dash Core functions for tasks like fetching balances, retrieving transaction details, or submitting proposals. Historically, this required running a full node or using command-line interfaces, posing a barrier for web developers who prefer lightweight solutions.

They discuss the industry trend of outsourcing node infrastructure to companies like QuickNode or Infura. While that model offers convenience, they caution that it can centralize services and potentially undermine the spirit of decentralized networks. Their new RPC Proxy seeks to offer an alternative by letting people host or access a Dash node through a simplified browser interface. By outlining real-world scenarios where a direct RPC approach is more transparent and flexible, they underscore the broader relevance of this emerging tool.

### 20:00 – 25:00 | The Path to Submitting a Standalone Proposal

Around this time, they explore the need for a standalone proposal distinct from the Incubator’s overall funding. The hosts mention previous attempts at building similar solutions on smaller scales—piecemeal experiments that never achieved wide usage. They recognize a pattern: too often, a particular project’s momentum slows due to shifting community priorities or unforeseen resource constraints.

To break this cycle, one contributor decided to submit an official proposal for the RPC Proxy. They argue that seeing it on the voting platform would signal community endorsement, motivating broader adoption among developers and even influencing Dash’s core roadmap. By aligning their work with direct Masternode-owner support, they hope the project’s long-term viability increases. This proposal structure may also guide future initiatives seeking a similar path to legitimacy.

### 25:00 – 30:00 | Web Developer Tooling and the Role of Infrastructure

Next, the hosts talk about how the RPC Proxy stands to improve the developer experience by eliminating the need for specialized software. They recall instances where essential features existed behind command-line interactions, forcing anyone who wanted to create proposals, test coin joins, or verify transactions to grapple with full-node complexities. For part-time contributors or web-focused developers, this overhead created a disincentive to experiment with Dash.

Drawing parallels to commercial API services, they emphasize the value of open solutions. Much like major infrastructure providers, the RPC Proxy can be deployed as a simple endpoint, but crucially, it remains under the community’s control. The speakers highlight the benefit of avoiding the reliance on a single corporate provider, thus ensuring greater autonomy for Dash developers and end-users alike.

### 30:00 – 35:00 | Demonstration of the New RPC Proxy

At this point, the conversation turns practical, offering a walkthrough of the new RPC Proxy tool. The hosts describe how a user can send HTTP calls directly from the browser, specifying methods and parameters in a straightforward interface. The solution even adapts to different use cases by automatically generating example commands in popular formats like cURL and fetch.

They illustrate how a command like `getaddressbalance` can be tested live in a web environment, returning data in a structured, readable format. With such an interactive setup, developers can rapidly test endpoints without resorting to command-line terminals or heavyweight scripts. This opens doors for faster debugging, clearer communication, and more accessible tutorials, ultimately lowering the learning curve for new entrants to the Dash ecosystem.

### 35:00 – 40:00 | Explorer Functionality and Linking Proposals

Moving on, they highlight an additional feature integrated into the tool: a web-based Explorer component. Users can generate links that, when clicked, automatically populate the RPC interface with specific methods and parameters. This streamlines cross-referencing data, such as proposals or transactions, for anyone researching them.

The hosts emphasize how this functionality helps unify various pieces of the Dash ecosystem. By embedding these links in documentation or discussion forums, developers and Masternode owners can instantly verify details on proposals or block information without switching tools. The conversation underscores that such interactivity can foster greater transparency and collaboration, reinforcing the importance of building highly shareable, open-source platforms.

### 40:00 – 45:00 | Public vs. Private RPC Calls and Security

In these minutes, they address security considerations, especially around public and private RPC calls. The speakers note that not all node commands should be exposed on a publicly facing tool, as certain commands relate to wallet functions or masternode operations. They describe their approach of segregating commands so critical actions remain locked behind proper authentication.

This leads to a broader point about running these services responsibly. The team acknowledges that communities need to define best practices for hosting an RPC Proxy, whether on personal infrastructure or shared masternodes. By maintaining a distinction between fully open methods and restricted capabilities, users can rely on standard security measures without compromising the convenience of a single, browser-friendly endpoint.

### 45:00 – 50:00 | Comparing Old Libraries to the New Approach

During this segment, the speakers talk about older Dash libraries—some of which had deeper abstractions that might confuse developers. Instead of simplifying usage, these layers sometimes obscured the underlying HTTP calls. By stripping back to minimal code, they hope to offer a more intuitive approach that is easier for seasoned web developers to adopt.

They recount challenges in navigating and maintaining large, legacy codebases, which often grew out of more complex programming styles from other languages. The presenters emphasize that by focusing on a straightforward and well-documented approach, the new RPC Proxy avoids many pitfalls. This evolution reflects a mindset geared toward speed, clarity, and long-term maintainability, ideally appealing to contributors keen on transparent solutions.

### 50:00 – 55:00 | Infrastructure, Deployment, and AI Assistance

Here, they detail how quickly a developer can deploy and manage their own node using straightforward commands. With only a few lines of code and minimal configuration, the entire RPC Proxy and Explorer setup becomes operational, enabling immediate exploration of Dash’s core functions. This stands in contrast to labor-intensive methods where developers must install multiple components manually.

They also touch on how AI tools, like GPT-4, played a role in generating boilerplate code for this project. While recognizing that manual oversight remains essential, they credit AI assistance for speeding up repetitive aspects. This hybrid approach of human expertise supported by AI highlights a future where standard web technologies and advanced tools combine to deliver robust, community-driven solutions for Dash.

### 55:00 – 60:00 | Future Proposals and Expanded Objectives

Looking ahead, the hosts describe their vision for the RPC Proxy: they see it as a starting point that could expand into wider functionalities, such as a direct browser-based proposal creation tool or improved coin join integrations. They explain how smaller tasks often feed into larger initiatives, revealing a roadmap for iterative progress in the Dash ecosystem.

Key to this progress is sustained backing from Masternode owners. By allowing developers to submit their own proposals, the network gains clarity on which projects are most needed. The speakers express optimism that official endorsements encourage more robust adoption, while acknowledging that forging consensus can be a gradual process. This reliance on open participation and incremental updates underscores the practical ethos driving the team.

### 60:00 – 65:00 | Hosting on Masternodes and Building Trust

During these minutes, they focus on the notion of hosting the RPC Proxy directly on masternodes. By distributing this service throughout the network, developers and everyday users alike can enjoy reliable, decentralized access to crucial Dash data. They argue that if Masternode operators see the advantage of running such an interface, it might prompt an even higher level of community engagement.

They reiterate their hope that these steps will shift perspective within the Dash ecosystem, encouraging teams like Dash Core Group to recognize the growing demand for web-accessible tools. Drawing parallels to daily life, the hosts stress that while grand projects can be inspiring, reliable, easily adoptable solutions often deliver the real-world impact that fosters steady user growth.

### 65:00 – 70:00 | Closing Thoughts and Looking Forward

In the final stretch, the speakers summarize their journey toward making Dash more accessible to a wide range of developers. They reiterate that alignment with Masternode votes is central to validating work and ensuring it meets broader community needs. Balancing personal passion projects with official endorsement, they remain confident that this new RPC Proxy and Explorer can serve as a valuable stepping stone.

They wrap up by acknowledging the collaborative efforts involved, from earlier library work in the Dash Incubator to the final stand-alone proposal. With the hope of continued improvements, they plan to refine user interfaces and push toward real adoption, both by novices and seasoned developers. Their ultimate goal is a thriving environment where essential tools are easy to find, straightforward to use, and reflective of the network’s shared vision.

[00:00] and we're live welcome everybody uh it's been two weeks we didn't have a show
[00:09] last week but we're back and i let my spritz card lapse um i ran
[00:22] out of dash funds so i've got to get that uh funded again that's why we have our friend the the stream yard duck up here in the corner so
[00:29] we'll get that taken care of for next time but um yeah welcome uh we're
[00:37] going to be talking today about rpcs remote procedure calls hopefully uh yeah that's now
[00:47] that i've said it we don't have to worry about not having that defined remote
[00:56] procedure calls rpcs uh we have with us aj welcome aj back i think it's been a while it's been like months i guess um and uh yeah let's uh
[01:04] let's get started so today i want to talk about some high level stuff before
[01:14] we get into the rpc stuff i want to talk about dash incubator what we
[01:22] uh are trying to accomplish in the incubator in general and i think that what we have here is kind of a uh yeah a little bit of a a
[01:34] move toward that goal so uh this is this is good good good news um
[01:42] in the incubator what we're trying to do is we're trying to help people and get into the uh and projects get off the ground from zero to one so
[01:48] what i found in dash many many years ago was that it was pretty difficult
[01:57] to get started with compared to other development teams such teams such as dcg who
[02:03] um have been working on stuff for years and years and years they have all the background um and so incubator was a place to say hey developers you might
[02:12] not be able to have like a successful proposal coming out of nowhere coming out
[02:18] of left field but if you want to work on dash stuff and you don't
[02:26] want to have to make the full jump through a arduous um interview process to
[02:33] work for dcg because it's basically full-time work i think they do some contract work as well but um i thought that the the the jump was too much but
[02:42] if we can just have a place to for people to come and do five
[02:51] dash tasks here 10 dash tasks there or even 100 dash tasks or even you know a longer term uh stay at the dash incubator that would be a great
[02:57] place for people to get from zero to one so aj was you were one
[03:06] of the first people that i wanted to uh have work in the incubator because i saw your work many many years ago like we live in the same town
[03:12] i went to your meetups um i saw your skill set you were very um
[03:24] very good at documentation very good at um low-level javascript stuff and focusing on web
[03:31] developers getting web developers uh the skills that they need with your beyond code boot camp stuff uh i consumed a lot of that and so i thought like this
[03:38] is the guy of all the all the guys that i know even tangentially in
[03:44] utah you were the guy that i wanted to work with um and so yeah we brought you into the incubator you've done a bunch of work for us and
[03:51] a lot of the work that you've done is kind of lower lower level stuff
[03:57] that doesn't unfortunately see the light of day until there's a web user interface that
[04:06] bring that to light and so you've been working on like libraries for dash payments
[04:17] and merchant tooling and uh honestly some of that has not really risen to the the light of day that we had hoped for but uh because it needs web
[04:26] user interfaces on it and you know getting that is not an easy task we've
[04:31] had jojo bite helping us with a little bit of that but for a variety of reasons we haven't been able to to get all of those uh things done
[04:40] uh so a little bit more about the the path and the arc of the
[04:48] incubator is that i saw that people work better and um just more motivated in general when they have their own proposals and so i i mean i felt that
[04:58] personally like i felt the the weight of the proposal on me to to have
[05:07] to uh perform and deliver value and things like that but it wasn't being carried
[05:17] out to the degree that i wanted to it to for other strategists or back in the day they were called admins there is a little bit of a distinction
[05:23] between those roles even today but um at a certain point we we changed our
[05:31] rule set and we said we're going to have strategists have their own proposals so
[05:39] that they have more a tighter alignment with the mno's and uh just delivering their
[05:46] own proposals so we did that jojo bite you've been working for a couple months under jojo bites uh proposal but also continue to work under my proposal as well
[05:53] this rpc stuff was one of those where i just really wanted it done so
[06:00] i pulled you back and said hey i'll i'll fund this under my proposal if you can get it done uh not the rpc stuff i'm sorry we were working
[06:06] on proposal stuff getting proposals uh delivered through the through a web interface and rpc
[06:14] happened to be one of those things that a required component of that um why
[06:21] don't you just talk a little bit about that process so that i can stop talking um what was what was that general process of you know i had you
[06:30] doing work on building a library to have proposals be able to be submitted through
[06:37] web interface um but then there were some things that that needed to be done
[06:44] before that and yeah how was that process let me let me circle back around to that so i have been paid a lot of money by the dash incubator
[06:52] by the dash voters over the last three years or so um and and that's
[07:02] so much so that it's i understand that it's ruffled a few feathers and one
[07:12] of the things that has been frustrating for me is i would 100% believe that the value that that the dash community is is getting out of what i've done
[07:21] is far more than what the payment has been other than that it's unrealized so
[07:30] the potential is far more yeah but it's been unrealized because for various reasons when
[07:39] i've wrapped up a project there's i don't want to say time after time but kind of in a way time after time there's been some sort of situational thing
[07:45] you know somebody raises a stir in the community about an issue and um the
[07:51] you know favor goes from the thing the thing that we were working towards to
[07:59] support favor shifts or or a key resource that was going to be providing a connecting integration or a partner that this was going to be helping drops the project
[08:06] that they're working on or you know there's just been a lot of that unfortunate
[08:12] type of business going on and i really want recognition for the work that i'm
[08:25] doing in a sense that i want people to know that their dash has gone
[08:32] towards a good cause and and that the cost of good software simply isn't isn't
[08:38] cheap but but this isn't something where there's not been deliverables month after month after
[08:43] month there have been deliverables month after month after month but those deliverables have been you know they're documented they're tested uh they are they are production ready but they're
[08:50] also they're not in products that are currently popular i think a good example of
[09:02] that is the work that you did on the dips that you uh proposed but
[09:10] they never really got anywhere other than being dips on a screen we didn't talk much about them um so is that is that kind of what you're talking about
[09:16] or well there's libraries as well i would say the libraries that implement the dips
[09:22] would be more important so the the algorithm for doing the cash send is actually
[09:31] implemented yeah there is not a it's not implemented on the mobile devices it's not
[09:40] implemented in the desktop wallet it's it's uh not implemented in a web wall so
[09:47] it's implemented it's available i have used it i have been using it to send money to kraken uh when i cash out i i've used it with jojo in
[09:56] a command line tool to test but there's a number of things like that where
[10:02] i'm i'm using it because i'm using it in the ugly way because i i the web development that i do is not user interface i do user experience which
[10:10] is essentially wireframing and i do software engineering because both of those are types of
[10:14] engineering user experience is often misconstrued as ui but user experience is actually about its
[10:20] engineering it's understanding the path the user is going to take what roadblocks they're going
[10:25] to hit it's not about what color are they going to like or what psychological
[10:29] effect is a circle or square going to have but it's about the the critical
[10:35] path is what it's called in the old school textbooks and that sort of thing and then the software engineering is not just can we put some code together but
[10:42] how do we how do we uh create these functions in basically the most flat
[10:48] way possible the least abstractions but with the necessary abstractions in place so that they're
[10:54] that they'll be accessible to developers that want to use them and and one great
[10:59] thing that has come out of this is as i have had the opportunity to see some of the other developers use these tools and get the feedback on it
[11:04] to see that that those design decisions have been validated uh yeah but it's more
[11:11] the library code that i'm that i'm talking about like that is code that can
[11:17] be used that has it has value that is readily accessible it's not raw or
[11:23] it's the refined gold yeah and i think what you're talking about with user experience is you you need to figure out how is the user going to use this
[11:30] product and then that's how you architect the product it's not uh so it's a
[11:37] question of architecture and that's what a lot of software engineers probably get wrong is
[11:43] they get the architecture wrong because they don't consider how the product is supposed to
[11:47] be used well i think that most software engineers aren't software engineers they're software developers
[11:51] and we used to distinguish between those two terms and engineering you know just like
[11:56] in civil engineering engineering has a particular meaning uh and we've kind of you know
[12:02] in recent years with the rise of boot camps and people you know wanting lots of cool titles and all that i think that the the meaning of engineering has
[12:07] been lost in the software industry but i don't know what else to call it
[12:14] so i'm gonna die on that hill okay all right so um yeah we're we're still in the little abstract land we are going to get to the rpc stuff
[12:21] but there is some there is there's reason why we're talking about some of this
[12:28] background because uh well aj you you have a new proposal up um i failed to get that on my screen but let me just bring this up uh dash
[12:36] central.org and i'll go ahead and share my screen let's see i think we've already
[12:50] added it oh thank you anthony and let me bump up the font here i
[13:01] wanted to get that's a little too far okay i'm gonna refresh okay so this is your proposal right now dcd digital cache dev rpc remote procedure call web proxy
[13:13] and explorer 2024 q3 um this has been claimed by you recently i just moments
[13:23] ago just moments ago you said that you know you have you had an old
[13:29] account cool aj86 that was on dash central and for a variety of reasons you haven't been able to uh get the support needed from dash central to claim that
[13:38] account again um so let's but you have claimed it as a new account digital
[13:44] cash dev that's kind of like your new brand going forward here um and so far you've got 63 yes votes and no no votes you're asking for four dash
[13:53] per month tell us about this project and why you submitted your own proposal for
[14:04] it okay so now we get to circle back to this while i answer the
[14:12] previous question as the start so there's been a number of times that first of all i did not understand all of the rpc stuff until until doing this and
[14:21] and then also so before i was i was getting the the uh there is
[14:30] a javascript uh node library that i was porting over to the browser and that
[14:36] library i believe was ported from c plus plus because it's it's not written in a typical javascript way it doesn't look like javascript code and there's a bunch of
[14:41] abstractions in there that look like they come from a c plus plus style of
[14:49] abstraction not from a typical uh programming style and so i actually did not understand
[14:59] for the longest time that this was just a simple very very simple http call because of all of the if you try to follow the code around it is
[15:07] just like so many places it just it was very yeah so when i finally
[15:19] figured out what the rpc call actually was which it turns out was also in
[15:26] some of the help for the rpc calls that i hadn't seen um previously in part possibly because it was it was down at the bottom and so my pager
[15:30] may have omitted that it was like one of the final lines was this example
[15:36] of curl which is exactly what i need to see but anyway so there's been a number of times that i've needed to use the rpcs and i've been using
[15:41] insight insight as people have used it are probably aware there's some artificial limitations in
[15:46] it as well as some bugs that just haven't been fixed because it's kind of
[15:50] in this you know been in this limbo state at least the the dash fork of insight and uh so insight is is actually it's it's great for having the
[15:59] ui but i would not recommend it to anyone in contrast to using the rpcs
[16:04] directly for development because the rpcs are they are law they are canon they are
[16:11] they are the the dash primitives uh and the abstractions that some of these other
[16:18] tools provide don't they don't add value on top of it they just make it
[16:24] different but not not significantly better like calling it v out versus calling it output index it's different but it's not it is a little more clear to call it
[16:31] output index but i think that output index is actually what the rpc calls it
[16:36] regardless point being i've had to deal with the rpcs on a number of occasions
[16:42] and i thought well every time why don't we just have a tool like this that's available for us to do the development and so i'd kind of do a
[16:46] little hack job on it every time that i needed to to make it accessible
[16:52] and then when i was doing the coin join work and the proposal work both of them needed access to the rpcs and i i did a little hack job
[16:58] again and then i thought well no this needs to be and you and i
[17:06] talked about this before you know i've said well we need a way to get stuff on dash.org like insight.dash.org we need a way to get stuff so that it
[17:14] is official for as much as someone may love or hate that term insight.dash.org is
[17:22] official it's on dash.org right yes and and the dcg proposals anything that people vote
[17:29] on is official that is law what the voters decide mnos decide what's official and so just kind of some thoughts all coalesced and came together and um you know
[17:39] just having it off of dash incubator i just don't think i'm sorry i just
[17:44] don't think it's it's taken seriously if we had rpc.dashincubator.org if it came out of
[17:53] the incubator i i could be wrong and and i hope i'm wrong but i think that there's some some level of of not taking it it seriously that these
[17:59] these are real tools for development at least i just don't see that that level
[18:06] of respect and i thought that having it on i wanted to have it on dash.org there doesn't seem to be a path forward to work with dcg on these
[18:14] things dcg seems to be a very closed ecosystem and it's just not easy to
[18:21] open those channels of communication i tried in the past and got kind of stonewalled
[18:29] with well dcg just can't take on the the concern of security and every possible
[18:35] imaginable thing that would have to be done so just no and that's that's not
[18:41] workable dash incubator just doesn't feel like the right brand and happenstantially i came across
[18:51] digitalcash.dev and i thought this this that that seeing that domain just kind of put
[18:57] more ideas in my head this is something that looks legit right it's digital cash that's what dash is that's what dash really is dash is the short term digital
[19:04] cash is the real thing and so i decided to put rpc.digitalcash.dev together and it
[19:14] needs to be on the leaderboard it needs to be something that the mnos vote
[19:23] for that this is an official tool that mnos cast their vote in support of web developers being able to work with digital cash so i know there's you know
[19:31] rambling my typical rambling but uh we need to have tools for web developers on
[19:41] the leaderboard and and so this is what you're talking about with the leaderboard one
[19:48] one view of it anyway yeah meaning that it's high up in the voting rank right and so i am not claiming any of this work that i did for
[19:57] the rpcs via dash incubator or or anything like this this is it was a significant amount of time that i did very very quickly to put this together as
[20:14] best as i could to meet my needs and i know what the needs of
[20:21] incubator are i know the frustrations i've met and even as i was doing the proposal i added more things so for example i wanted to link to hey why
[20:30] is this not up on the leaderboard and so well how do i link to
[20:37] it well i need to link to the g object how do i link to the g object if if it's not on the leaderboard where can i link to
[20:41] a g object so so then i i updated the rpc tool so that i
[20:50] could link to my specific g object as a proposal and so when somebody clicks on that link it opens up and they can see my my g object that
[20:56] represents my proposal so even as i was building it i was using it as
[21:02] part of building it so everything that i've done around this proposal none of it was done except for running a full node none of it was done except with
[21:09] tools that either have been built as part of dash incubator or that i built
[21:16] during the proposal process so i i signed the message to get it claimed on
[21:24] das central using the the signing tool that we built three years ago when we
[21:31] were building voting tools um i submitted the transactions with the tools that we built a couple of years ago that are web web ready transactions they're what are uh
[21:38] being used in the wallet that jojo's been developing um the proposal was submitted with
[21:46] the tools that were commissioned by dash incubator so everything that's been done has been
[21:52] done primarily with javascript there were a couple of things that are written in go
[21:58] but everything that's been done has been done with web friendly tools none of it has been done with uh desktop only or mobile only tools yeah this this is
[22:06] a goal that you and i very much share we want dash tooling to be
[22:15] accessible for web developers not people who have the dedication already to spin up a
[22:21] full dash node and run their own full node and syncing blocks and everything like that so these things should be accessible from the web from people who aren't yet
[22:29] dedicated to full dash tooling um and so i know that this this show we've
[22:39] we've been in lots of different places already um there's a lot to talk about i do want to bring you in anthony um to just give us an introduction
[22:47] about um rpcs themselves because in a former life of yours in a former uh
[22:56] job of yours you were working at quick node which is an rpc provider so now as we we haven't even really talked about the tool yet that that you've
[23:05] built aj so but um i i want to for the audience give us a
[23:14] give us a brief recap of a summary of what what an rpc is what you did at quick node uh i'm going to share my uh this is the
[23:22] website for quick node let's see where is it here we are what did you
[23:31] do there um this is one of your products um tell us about quick node and um the rpc service that you provided yeah so what quick dome provided was
[23:41] a really easy way to get spun up with a bunch of different chains so
[23:49] the you know flagship was ethereum and what the rpc provides you is an interface
[24:00] into the blockchain but while giving you kind of your own dedicated um like end
[24:09] point so that if you you don't need to necessarily use like a dedicated test net that is being run by the main team you can kind of spin up
[24:14] your own you can do this for main net or test net you could do
[24:19] it with a bunch of different chains they also gave you different apis that kind of do like higher level functionality but the the main thing is that it allowed
[24:28] you to kind of skip the step of having to run any of this stuff
[24:33] on your own computer like actually have like all the stuff we've been talking about in terms of how do you you know do dashmate or master nodes or any
[24:38] of that kind of stuff that is being run on someone else's infrastructure and so
[24:44] it's kind of just like a cloud provider if you think about it similar to
[24:54] aws or anything like that and the nice thing is that it just gives you
[24:57] reliability and you don't have to worry about the devops angle yeah i did want to say a little bit about that as well because this is one of the
[25:05] big issues in blockchain right now is in any of these blockchains is that it
[25:14] it's difficult for web developers to want to or even just go ahead and do
[25:21] uh putting up your own infrastructure and so this whole there's been a whole industry of api rpc api providers that do the infrastructure for you they run a node
[25:29] they set up an ethereum node for example um i don't think that uh quick
[25:37] node ever supported dash we talked about it maybe asking them to do it at
[25:43] one point but um the idea is the same with any of these chains is that instead of running your own node you have somebody like a quick node or
[25:50] somebody like an infura or um uh what's the other big one alchemy um they
[26:00] run your node and then you call an api that then calls the rpc of
[26:08] the node itself and then spits back the answer to you so you're essentially outsourcing your infrastructure provision to these companies this is something uh it's kind of a big
[26:14] problem in a sense um but it's also yeah um i just wanted to mention
[26:24] real briefly that uh this this blog blog right here moxie.org um first impressions of
[26:34] web3 he talks about this um this concept of nobody's really in blockchains nobody's really
[26:43] running your own node uh themselves nobody's running their own nodes and so you get this situation where the whole value proposition of blockchains kind of loses its uh luster
[26:52] because instead of people running their own nodes they're just doing posts to infura for
[27:00] example right jason rpc um they just do a call and and they they call
[27:08] into infuras infrastructure that hopefully is running their their nodes properly and and the way
[27:13] that you want them to and in the case of the fork you know it
[27:21] would be these infrastructure providers that are defining literally defining what the code uh what the project is like if there were ever a hard fork and people had to
[27:31] choose it wouldn't be the consumers of these apis it would be these node providers
[27:38] so that's just one thing i'm not going to go into detail about that i
[27:42] talked a little bit about that on our last twitter um but let's see where was i going um we were back here anyway um so that's that's what rpcs
[27:55] are so um if you're not running your own node you might want to be
[28:04] able to access the data from the node and and that's what the rpc these
[28:11] uh commercialized companies are doing for people now aj what you've done is you're saying
[28:17] hey you don't need one of these companies quick don't doesn't uh doesn't uh support dash but there are several that do like um like um now right node now
[28:29] i have a list of these yesterday that i didn't i forgot to bring up
[28:34] but there are several um now nodes i think that's what i was thinking of let's see now nodes yeah i checked out this this service i was curious about
[28:43] this and um their search for dash so so if you wanted something like this
[28:54] if you wanted like an rpc provider for for dash if you were one of
[29:02] these web developers who doesn't necessarily want to spin up your own node and maintain that you could pay now nodes to turn on a note to have to access
[29:10] the node for you so you could just you basically get all the data from
[29:20] the node uh from from this company now i think this is a problem i i don't like the idea of infrastructure being dominated by corporations uh and so that's
[29:29] why i think the work that you've done aj is is very important i'm going
[29:36] to come back to that um with this rpc web proxy because it basically lets
[29:45] any developer very easily access or spin up their own node if they want to
[29:54] and the rpc proxy for it so you could basically become your own um now nodes if you wanted to but if you don't want to you can for free
[30:02] uh essentially well that comes into the proposal of your uh your maintenance costs here
[30:10] uh it's not exactly for free but it's paid for by the treasury by the
[30:22] um yeah by by the stakeholders of dash so there are a few reasons why that's important uh but without i i don't want to get into the the philosophical
[30:32] and and uh kind of political side of it too much i want to get
[30:38] more into the the technical side of it so aj can you can you uh kind of take the wheel i'm going to share your screen now um so that
[30:45] you can just like present what you've built here and why you think it's important
[30:51] all right go ahead okay let me make this a bit bigger again i see
[30:58] trying to manage two screens at the same time here i'll make it a little
[31:04] bigger again all right so there's there's two components to this software and there's kind of three ways to run it i i do want to say this is something
[31:09] else that i i don't think has gotten very much uh publicity you can run
[31:19] a full node either on testnet or on mainnet in two commands so if you set up your well technically three if you set up your uh your you provision
[31:31] your container or your virtual environment or your computer whatever it is you can on
[31:37] mac and linux you can just copy and paste this command for the installer and
[31:42] you can see the source for the installer here what it's what it's doing and
[31:48] then it'll print out on the screen to run this command here to to start
[31:57] up the volume and you need to supply the storage volume so you probably need to make a directory and mount your your storage volume uh but that that's it
[32:04] that's that's how i set up the nodes for this rpc tool is as i
[32:15] i just copied and pasted and run this and then and then you wait for the sync time and that's it so and we can do that for master nodes
[32:20] too that was another one of the projects that kind of fell fell by the
[32:28] wayside um but to finish up being able to do this process for master nodes well is it i think that that will come into play shortly but in any
[32:35] case so you have to have the full node either testnet mainnet whatever and then
[32:43] there's the rpc proxy which is server software which basically just needs to know what's
[32:49] the username password and ip address of that full node and then driving the process
[32:56] of if you wanted to run all of this infrastructure yourself and not use it as a service right so right so there's as a service is number one because
[33:02] if somebody's coming into dash they need to experiment with this so i'm just going
[33:08] to go ahead and select what the example shows get address balance you can see
[33:14] that it updates here with the help if i click on curl it updates everything updates live as as i put it in and then i'm just going to copy
[33:21] and paste in this testnet address here you can see that the example updates curl
[33:28] and fetch those are the those are the universal languages for understanding http requests regardless
[33:35] of what language you develop in so whether you're a javascript developer or a go
[33:43] developer or a python developer um any developer that is a non first year is
[33:53] and and hopefully most first years because hopefully most first years would have had this
[33:57] covered in their their boot camp as the basic training but they're they're going to understand how to translate either curl or fetch into their language of choice fetch is
[34:03] javascript native curl is unix native so mac linux etc and then there's and then
[34:10] there's the help so you've got all the information that you need right here and
[34:18] then if you click on try it well here's the output there's what the balance
[34:23] looks like the immature balance the spendable balance received and we can do that with anything and in fact how about this one which one nick says uh like like
[34:32] a get block he's asking uh we could do get block sure so let's do
[34:41] get block whoops uh i don't have that one white listed or that's not one of them oh actually no here's the context oh there is there is get block
[34:47] something perhaps because of the screen share something's going weird and it's um oh actually
[34:54] might be the on the on key up handler i might need to fix something
[35:00] um but okay so i can do get block but then i'd have to i'd
[35:05] have to put in whatever you'd have to put in a block but anyway is
[35:09] that a number is that like i just put in the number one i don't know if it works with heights or if it has to have the block hash
[35:16] well we'll find out you have the arguments right there block hash so you do
[35:21] need the hash okay there is there is one that gets i think is a
[35:22] good block height anyway you can see there we go okay so get get block hash you can put in the number and then you get out the hash and
[35:36] then we could take that hash and we could put that hash into here and
[35:41] we could run get block and this is the raw data well without any abstractions
[35:50] and an abstraction in order to be useful needs to provide like a 2x or
[35:59] a 10x in value and honestly i think that most of the abstractions that exist out in the wild are for the purpose of capturing people's dollars not for the
[36:05] purpose of making it easier to interact with the blockchain well that's what a lot
[36:10] of these corporations are doing yes it is a big business um because yeah it
[36:17] it becomes a gatekeeping or what's the right word when you it makes it proprietary
[36:22] it makes it proprietary to them so once you're using their tooling you have to keep using their tooling if you use rpcs directly there is it is it this
[36:29] is dash official anyway so another thing that i wanted to point out about this
[36:35] if i can um if i can actually find it real quick was i i
[36:44] think that it'll be right here in a chat okay yes yes it is so we have here nope not that one uh i i want to bring up my
[36:52] proposal so i have a link that i can click and clicking the link will
[36:59] bring up the proposal i'll i'll add it to my if you want to look at the the screen i i will find it okay okay so i may have
[37:08] also put it in the leaderboard and you click on your proposal and then in
[37:17] your proposal you go to the external information because i don't know if people know
[37:23] this but when you submit a proposal to the network tools like mno watch and dash central they'll pick it up like you don't you don't submit it through mno
[37:28] watch you don't submit it through um uh dash central dash central is looking at
[37:37] the chain as the as the uh as the source of truth and in that
[37:46] chain in that source of truth the external information this is what's going on the peer-to-peer network that you have submitted a proposal with this url as your proposal url
[37:53] now a lot of people will put a dash central url in here but and
[37:59] you can put any any url in here and so you've you've put this digitalcache.dev/proposals/dcd
[38:10] da da da da so here's your actual proposal url and you have a video about it then you link to the actual sites for the tool itself the mainnet
[38:18] and the testnet we just looked at that you you went over that is this
[38:23] the proposal that you're you're talking about uh no i meant the g object but
[38:30] yes it is that proposal but i can't post it in the chat but i will post it in the discord and maybe you're allowed to post it in the
[38:35] chat so and and i'll just bring this up momentarily so everybody can see what
[38:40] i'm talking about so this i'm going to click a link and then if you
[38:47] share my screen i'm going to click a link and then this is going to appear already filled out so are you on my screen i am now okay so
[38:55] i just clicked the link and the link has the rpc call in the url
[39:04] and so you can see here it fills out the rpc call and then there's the outputs it auto populates and also auto executes do you want to do it
[39:10] again just i wasn't quite on your screen when you first started it'll be so
[39:15] fast with the frame rate that they capture it probably won't work but i'll do
[39:20] it again so i i don't know if you could see that it just blinked oh you're you're clicking it from somewhere else i see i see yeah i'm clicking
[39:24] i'm clicking it on the other window okay what you're saying i think if you
[39:30] talked about the url structure people would get the idea the developers in the room
[39:34] anyway yeah it's it's i mean you've seen this before you've seen this on things
[39:41] like um it's maybe not js fiddle itself but sites like js fiddle you know you just encode the data up in the url and then when the page loads
[39:46] you grab the data and you do the thing so but but you know so
[39:52] this is an obvious thing this is not you know like talking about it it's not like oh wow but at the same time it is because no one did
[39:58] this before there is no tool that does this yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna switch
[40:02] it back to my screen because i want to i want to show people what what did exist and why you you think that that was not quite the right
[40:10] approach so um what did exist and what does exist is so just so people
[40:18] know here's the art the actual low-level rpc uh documentation in case anybody wants to
[40:24] know that we're done with this uh we're done with this what did exist was on the github.com slash dash pay slash dash d hyphen rpc this has existed for
[40:36] a long time i think uh mikhail in the chat said this is super old
[40:44] stuff you can see 10 years ago uh was one of the earliest commits but
[40:50] it has been maintained relatively uh you know it's been somewhat maintained over the years
[40:56] this was it's been on life support i would not say it's been maintained but it has been on life support so this did exist it's a javascript library that
[41:03] you instantiate an rpc client with but it does not work in the browser does
[41:10] not work in the browser it works in well i don't know if they accepted my pr to make it work in the browser or not but i had a
[41:15] bunch of prs for this and some stuff happened and a couple got accepted and
[41:23] the rest weren't rejected they just disappeared because of a github bug so talk about how this library compares to what you've built and also i wanted to at least
[41:35] mention this uh issue that you look yeah bring that up several issues over the
[41:42] past few you know uh over the past months and then this was your most
[41:50] recent issue uh calling to deprecate slash archive this repo does more harm than good prefer fetch plus js doc do you want to talk about this a little bit
[41:55] just briefly yeah so what this library does that you wouldn't be able to tell
[42:03] from looking at the code is make an http call that's always to a fixed
[42:11] string with a fixed body and the reason i say you wouldn't be able to tell from looking at the code is that there are several layers of builder abstractions
[42:16] and they're so incremental and um unusual that it's it's you obviously if you can
[42:32] execute code the code in your brain and you can follow through and follow through
[42:35] and follow through and follow through then yes you you can understand but but what this actually does is the function that i have here so if you switch or
[42:42] just go to that issue go to go back to that issue and just scroll
[42:47] to the middle of the issue because it's the same thing what's in that issue
[42:57] and and what i'm showing so stop stop go back up this is that entire
[43:05] library if you take away its abstractions if you just write the code as as
[43:13] plain code without having any sort of wrappers or inheritance this is what you get and if you wanted to transform it to behave exactly the way that library behaves
[43:22] then it's it's about another 10 lines of code to fill out some of the
[43:29] abstractions that that library creates and then uh a list that's i think the list
[43:35] is like 30 or 40 lines long that's not code but that's data that the
[43:44] code would operate on so that entire library it's it's it's far anybody can and i and i will say this with confidence anybody who is a web developer can
[43:52] read that block of code and understand what it does and it is it is
[44:00] in truth because they do the same thing it is functionally equivalent to that entire
[44:09] library that library is not providing any additional convenience uh other other than there is
[44:14] one convenience that provides but like i said it'd be like another 10 lines of code and i don't think the convenience is worth it because it actually gives you
[44:19] uh partially incorrect information and i think it's better to have fully correct information or
[44:24] not have that information at all not have information that is sometimes correct um so
[44:32] anyway i'd recommend that anybody just use exactly what's on uh you know in that
[44:41] poster or that's generated here by this screen um i don't know if you're looking at mine or yours yeah that fetch right there so if you drag that bar
[44:45] down that's the same thing that you see in that issue it it's just a
[44:52] few lines shorter because it is giving the exact request that you could copy and
[44:57] paste and have it run as opposed to giving you it encapsulated in a in
[45:03] a function as a convenience method but other than that the two are equivalent so i i perfectly believe that adding a little bit of convenience to that adding another
[45:11] two three lines to it to bring it to be more convenient yeah totally makes
[45:15] sense but if somebody just wants something to copy paste this copy paste and it
[45:21] works it works on the web it's web native it works in node uh it's you know if you put this in the chat gpt and say translate this to
[45:28] go translate this to rust translate this to whatever gpt is going to be able
[45:34] to do that without any issue it's going it is most likely going to be
[45:41] 100 correct every time that is how standard this is uh okay so you're bringing you're bringing the uh you're you're taking away you're saying it's better for developers to
[45:49] work with less of an abstraction and getting a little bit closer to this is
[45:58] exactly the rpc that you would call if you were running a full node and
[46:04] you've got them all covered all you have to do is copy paste some code
[46:09] yes but it's it's a little bit different than that because there are abstractions that are useful they're abstractions that add clear convenience where it's like well you know we'd
[46:16] want people to know the underpinnings of how this works but how it works is
[46:23] a little complicated so let's take for example coin join or the proposal process there
[46:28] are some extra abstractions that need to be there in order for people to get their work done i would not say to someone oh yeah just use the core
[46:34] primitives for g object and build out a proposal process the library that we created
[46:41] for the proposal process is an abstraction but it's an abstraction that is it is
[46:51] uh you know it 10x is someone's ability to quickly do a proposal in code
[47:00] the difference between what this function provides and what the dash d rpc library provide they are at the same level of abstraction in terms of as a user i
[47:09] need to pass in a method and i need to pass in an array of
[47:18] arguments it's the same for both libraries this one doesn't need a library because you can literally take the 15 lines of code and that's pretty printed with comments right
[47:26] uh and by with comments i mean the variable names are named to what they
[47:31] do so it doesn't actually have comments in there but it the variable names are
[47:37] descriptive variable names so you i mean and somebody else that's a ninja coder they they'd condense that down to like five lines because they put a bunch of stuff
[47:42] on one line and they would have all the variables just in line without having
[47:47] names and you know stuff like so so what i what you're getting the same
[47:55] level of abstraction you're not getting a better level of abstraction if you're using dash d rpc you're getting the same level of abstraction it's just that dash d rpc
[48:04] i cannot believe that somebody wrote it from scratch as javascript code i just i
[48:08] just can't believe that they were porting it from something else because there was some
[48:15] other code base that did not have an http primitive because you would never you
[48:21] would never do that in javascript if somebody didn't javascript they weren't a javascript developer
[48:26] they weren't a web developer because you would never you would never it's just it's a thing that you would do in another language like let's say that you were
[48:31] a tcp dev let's say that that's how you were raised you might create some
[48:36] sort of abstraction like that if you were not a web developer if you were
[48:41] not familiar with the web if i mean i know a guy who he's like 55 years old or so and to him the web is scary so he's building
[48:50] a web product now and i've been brought on to that to kind of help
[48:57] uh get that production ready and we've had some conversations and you know i'm saying
[49:03] hey this this is actually a standard practice thing he's like oh well you know i'm just not familiar with the web my whole life i've been doing device work
[49:08] and you know tcp sockets etc etc so i could see some guy like him
[49:16] in good faith making a library somewhat similar to this because it's like oh i
[49:20] don't really understand javascript i'm used to working with tcp protocols i don't really understand the web like obviously i use the web every day but in my development processes
[49:25] i'm working on embedded devices and and uh you know it's just a different environment
[49:31] right but that was not that code was not written by a web developer so
[49:37] you get the same level of abstraction you get the same convenience but one you
[49:42] can read and immediately understand as a web developer i understand exactly what this does and the other one you can't okay so i have a i have a question
[49:49] here that i don't remember the context to but uh michael shenmick says what indexes
[49:58] are enabled on your endpoint okay so uh go back to my screen so this
[50:08] is the installer for for uh dash d and you can see here it tells you what the recommended hardware is this actually needs to go up because uh now
[50:14] i i think that matching what dcg suggests since the uh introduction of evolution of
[50:20] 200 gigabytes i you could do 150 but you can't really do a hundred you're
[50:24] gonna you're gonna have a problem with that but anyway um i think you can still get by with eight gigs it seems like but anyway um so this installer
[50:33] will create in fact we can go look at it let's go look at it
[50:38] it will create because the assumption with this installer is that the reason you're using
[50:44] it actually i'm going to go to dash core because that's where it copies the
[50:48] script from um what's it or is it dash core utils sorry there it is dash core utils so dash d also installs dash core utils which are not official
[50:58] utilities but you can see i've got a dash dot example dot com so the
[51:03] the idea of this installer is the reason you're installing it is for doing merchant
[51:11] or integration work or development work of some sort and so all of the indexes are turned on so if you want to see what that's like i'll see if
[51:17] i if it'll allow me to post this link in the chat so all the
[51:25] indexes are turned on but i will say it won't let me do that so again ryan i will post this to you and maybe you'll be able to repost
[51:29] it in the chat yeah put it in the private chat uh will it go
[51:34] in the private chat let's see if it goes in the private chat oh it does go in the private chat okay and i'll put the other one there as
[51:40] well the previous one i posted so i i may not have gotten all of
[51:50] the rpcs correctly sorted so let me go back to the code for this i'm gonna close out some of these other things so that we don't get distracted by
[51:55] having too many um windows open so let me go to the code for this
[52:01] and there is a static directory and in here this is a public rpcs directory
[52:07] so before we start deploying this on masternodes we do need to go through this
[52:14] with a little bit of a finer eye and make sure that i've categorized things correctly because there may be rpcs that are public rpcs that i left out then
[52:20] by public rpc what we mean is does not access masternode capabilities and does not
[52:29] access wallet functionality so disable wallet disable masternode if you were if you were to
[52:38] run dash d um as not a masternode with the wallet disabled everything that's left is a public rpc all of the things that you would try that are not
[52:45] public rpcs you would be getting back an error on uh with with one with
[52:52] at least one exception which is g object submit is a public rpc but it
[52:59] may because of the way the code is structured the code is not structured according to public versus private um it was it was not designed with that type of
[53:06] security in mind um so it does not segment the code that way as far
[53:13] as as far as i could tell i could be wrong about it if i'm wrong about that then great but these are all public g object methods but g
[53:20] object also has private methods so anyway there's there's a number of things here that
[53:27] we just need to double check to make sure that this list is correct but
[53:32] this list is something that can be modified at deployment time so this list is
[53:39] what's embedded into the binary but all you need to do is create a public folder that has your copy of this list and when you deploy this you could
[53:47] expose it either way you want so this file is the same defaults and if
[53:58] some new rpc comes out then you know without waiting for a new release of this you could just change this file and in fact what i might do is
[54:04] add an init command to this so that it creates the folder that has the
[54:09] web stuff in it so that that's more obvious um because yeah you just create
[54:16] the public folder and then whatever's in there is what gets served for the explorer so this explorer is embedded in the binary but if you just create a public
[54:22] folder and then you put in your own index.html or you put in your own
[54:29] mvp.css or whatever it is then it's going to serve that instead of the one
[54:36] that's embedded so that you can quickly prototype a change or get new functionality or
[54:42] or you know prototype fixing a bug to submit or something like that very cool very cool so michael cluster says not gonna lie this is pretty cool um and
[54:50] then says also i'm voting yes on this proposal it sounds good it looks like
[54:56] yeah and it looks like you know he's not the only one supporting this so far if we want to zoom back to the proposal i don't know if we
[55:02] actually um went through all of it but what what else did you want to
[55:10] say on the technical level um before we zoom back to the higher level uh
[55:20] what you're trying to accomplish more generally outside of just this rpc stuff so let's see i think this this kind of covers the technical again like i don't know
[55:27] what the audience go code at all or because i i i know like people
[55:34] might not know like you've done you've done a lot of javascript stuff but you're
[55:41] up you're you're one true love and programming is go right yeah i am i'm a big fan of go and i'm looking forward to zig becoming more stable so
[55:46] that i can enjoy zig as much as i enjoy go and this web proxy was written in in uh on the back end side is written and go yeah
[55:55] and i i mean for better or for worse i've i've begun embracing not this
[56:01] is not the better or worse part i've begun embracing gpt 4.0 uh before gpt
[56:10] 4.0 i thought that gpt was pretty useless it wasted more of my time then it helped so i didn't even try gpt 4 at all because i was so
[56:16] disenchanted with 3 and 3.5 but with gpt 4.0 it may also have to do
[56:22] with my prompt engineering skills are better i'm asking questions in a better way but i was able to save myself a lot of time by generating most of the
[56:28] boilerplate for this code using gpt 4.0 and then just you know correcting a few
[56:36] things renaming a few things getting it to match my style and the cleanliness that
[56:41] i like to have in my code but um for better or for worse this
[56:50] was this was largely generated um in concert with gpt 4.0 and the reason that i want to point out that this is a good thing is that what it
[56:57] says is that what i'm doing is so standard so easy to be understood so
[57:04] well known has so many similar examples across the web that i was able to put it into a generation tool and the generation tool was able to give me
[57:11] an answer that was 90 correct and i just did a few edits i mean
[57:18] it's that that also downs plays a little bit because i would say that gpt saved me like 10 of my time because the other thing is it like it's
[57:25] 90 of your time is not the code 90 of your time is you testing
[57:35] the code documenting the code you know and and i maybe i could have used
[57:40] gpt a little bit more because gpt is pretty good at writing some tests and stuff like that but there's things that as part of the coding process you discover
[57:44] what's right and wrong because you are the coder you're dogfooding your code as you're
[57:49] creating your code and so you're realizing oh wait this isn't quite right like having
[57:55] this input is cumbersome and not intuitive let's let's back that off and and do it this way so so it's not like oh you know i i put i
[58:04] put a few sentences into gpt and i got back this code and this was
[58:10] zero effort this was actually i this was a a very large effort over a very short amount of time so i did all of this within two days i
[58:16] don't believe that this actually contains any of the libraries that we've created before just
[58:22] because of the way that this code worked out i don't i didn't have to
[58:28] use transactions i didn't have to do like what is here on the page is completely novel and um from the git commit i believe i created everything within two
[58:33] days if it wasn't two days it was three days um but it was a
[58:40] very high intensity effort i spent over 20 hours on it um so when gpt saved me time by writing 90 of the code it it didn't write the front-end
[58:49] code i do have a an output i just wanted to see what would happen
[58:54] if i gave it some front-end code to write and the output is is pretty laughable so i i just tried that once and i didn't go any further with
[59:00] that for for what i wanted to do um but anyway the the point being
[59:10] that um yeah the go code was so normal compared to what other web developers
[59:15] are doing and what's industry standard practices there were enough examples out there to be analyzed that gpt was able to to do something that you know if you were
[59:20] just doing a hack job that code alone would have worked obviously i wanted this
[59:27] to have some more polish to it and so yes you know it saved me some time but i put it in the realm of of 10 percent and i
[59:32] and i think that you know even if people are having lots of their code
[59:38] generated by gpt if they're if they are if they're focused on the quality of the outcome um you know it's going to be like a 10 maybe maybe a
[59:44] 20 time save for people that are really good and have a lot of experience
[59:51] using gpt and llms but it's not it's not like like oh that you know this this was so easy even gpt could do it no no it was so
[59:59] standard and well understood in general that gpt was able to assist greatly anything to
[60:05] say about that anthony you're our resident resident gpt guru yeah i mean i've been
[60:14] using it for a bunch of stuff for a while i think um you know there's a little bit of a learning curve in terms of like not using it
[60:21] in a way where it takes more time than you save but um yeah i think especially i mean aj hit on the fact that the more web standard it
[60:33] is and the more kind of general you know not a specific library or package
[60:40] or something like that it's really good at that kind of stuff and it pretty much knows just how to program and knows how to program for things that it's
[60:46] been trained on for years and years and years and years so this kind of
[60:52] stuff like you know curls and fetches that's going to be one of the things
[61:02] that's going to excel at cool all right well um i i really like this project i like you said aj i i wish that we would have kind of
[61:10] stumbled upon the need for this a lot earlier it would have i think helped
[61:17] in some of our other projects as well um but this is the nature of the beast you just kind of have to find it when it's most relevant the
[61:24] need was there but having done the work on the proposal system so that i
[61:30] because proposals were a black box to me and i just i don't like black boxes and and to my own detriment i will just stay away from stuff that's
[61:37] a black box but having to work on the proposal stuff was what gave me
[61:43] the confidence okay because i don't i don't want to do this crap if it just ends up in the trash bin like i'm i'm so burnt out by that
[61:49] over the last couple of years where the value isn't recognized and i needed it
[61:54] to go before the voters so that the voters could put forth this is an
[62:04] official tool supported by mnos yeah and so that's we've had the need for a long time i've known we've had the need and like i said i did these
[62:08] little hack jobs because it's like oh i just need this as a one-off and
[62:13] i knew i was going to need it again but it's like well if we don't have the support of the mnos and and i just i and i still
[62:19] this is all new to me i don't know how this interaction with mnos is
[62:23] going to go because i've not directly interacted with the mnos before i don't know who they are i don't know their usernames are i don't know what their likes
[62:26] are i don't know what they believe so you know the mnos are a black
[62:33] box but i guess it's a black box that i'm going to learn um through through doing proposals and i'm hoping that we get this at the top of the
[62:39] leaderboard and that you know they say in sales you need to get three yeses
[62:46] right uh and that's kind of what i'm hoping to do here is that it
[62:53] looks like we're going to get the first yes on yes mnos vote to support web developers and then i want to get the other yeses and one of those
[62:59] that's coming up is mnos support being able to run this type of software for
[63:07] the community now i don't want the one one that's on digitalcash.dev to go away
[63:13] on the mnos themselves you're saying on the masternodes themselves you you think that this
[63:20] service should live on the masternodes themselves yes and so the future proposals that there's two in particular that i am noodling on and will soon get to writing out
[63:26] they're not going to be fordash proposals they're going to be me looking at okay
[63:34] how many days am i going to work on this and uh from that metric
[63:41] you know because i'm i make my living coding and i'm not doing charity i'm a mercenary i'm expensive uh i'm i'm not trying to you know give anybody a
[63:51] a big discount because i because i like you like that's not sustainable what's sustainable
[63:59] is actual programmer rates by people who are knowledgeable and doing they're doing making the
[64:04] best tools that they can and so i'm i i will give a little bit of a discount in the sense that i'm gonna i'm gonna do this on a
[64:09] week rate rather than an hourly rate so i you know because and that's what
[64:16] i need anyway right because weeks are more important than hours in terms of my
[64:21] income because i'm only going to be working on so many projects in a week and the hours and that like i can only work so many hours on a
[64:26] project having a whole you know two week period paid for is or a whole
[64:33] week period paid for allows me to be more unrestrained and that i can put in as many hours as i want because if i put in fewer hours and
[64:40] not necessarily like i'm not going to be able to switch my brain over to
[64:45] another task that day and work on something else anyway like when i work on
[64:50] a project i'm pretty much just working on one thing on one day and i'm working up to the point where i get halted and stopped and i need somebody
[64:55] else's input right so with this i've got years of experience i know a lot
[65:00] about what the constraints are technically so if the mnos will unleash me i will unleash okay well yeah i i think this is a great direction i i like
[65:09] that we have we took the project that we were working on with niles which
[65:16] was how do we get web how do we get uh the ability to create
[65:25] proposals directly from a website instead of having to copy and paste commands into a full node um console and we we were successful with that niles figured out we'll
[65:36] talk about this in a later show probably how that wrapped up but uh we
[65:44] were able to as a team um finish that uh library to the point where
[65:52] you actually took it to the next step and used the tool that we built um the the tooling uh i think you just did it on the command line
[66:00] or or not the command line but uh anyway you used the tools that we
[66:06] built for the proposal stuff you created your own proposal to support this rpc stuff and rpc stuff will be used for both the proposal when it goes live on
[66:14] the web as well as the proposal tool as well as the coin join tool
[66:22] when that goes live on the web yes uh and i like this direction i'm looking forward to your um your other fuller proposals as well because like you said
[66:29] you know you did this uh rpc a lot of this rpc work on your
[66:36] own dime uh but that's not sustainable you'll need funding uh to continue developing stuff
[66:43] like this in the future so i'm looking forward to those i'm glad that um the incubator was able to help get you to the point where you're now hopefully
[66:51] able to in the future have your own proposals that are successful so uh we'll
[66:58] we'll see about that and anything else to say uh final words we've been going
[67:05] for about an hour now so well i'm i'm not i'm not confident enough to like leave the incubator yet but i will say that if these proposals go well
[67:11] and i'm able to do proposals that basically you know cover half a month's income
[67:19] for me and and i have like i have i live in in a a tech valley uh you know things aren't cheap i demand a high price but i'll
[67:28] get the crap done um so you know if that turns out to to to
[67:36] work then there could be i i i could have less time available for incubator and that might be a success all the way around but as for now it's
[67:42] not my goal to leave incubator it's my goal to get some things that i
[67:52] believe need to be done as soon as possible done quicker and have have buy-in
[67:57] from the mnos and also let's just put it bluntly there needs to be a signal to dcg of what the mnos care about and it's important to me the
[68:06] dcg is going to be able to see this rpc tool up on the leaderboard
[68:13] and i hope that that puts in their heads huh maybe we should have more focus on the web maybe maybe the directions we're taking things although and i'll do
[68:22] i'll do this this analogy right rocket ship to the moon really cool really glamorous
[68:30] everybody loves it easy to get advertisements to put it on a cereal box right
[68:37] getting a toyota corolla to take you to the grocery store world changing kind of
[68:46] boring impacts your daily life can't live without it kind of boring and so while the moon shots there needs to be investment for that for morale boost and everything
[68:56] the majority of the majority of where things need to go is where the puck
[69:04] is going to go the majority of things you know the majority of the of
[69:11] the interest and the investment need to be in the things that are world changing going to the moon wasn't world changing your life is no better for having gone
[69:18] to the moon damn it feels good but it didn't make an impact right you're
[69:25] saying we need people need toyota corollas more than they need spaceships in their everyday
[69:34] life yeah and and this this vote is a vote for a toyota corolla it's a boring technology that's so well understood that gpt was able to greatly assist with
[69:40] it but it's going to have a huge impact on people coming into dash being
[69:47] able to explore it become familiar with it and understand the primitives and we need
[69:53] more of that and we need it to run on masternodes agreed i i think that's a good place to leave it out um i'm not sure if it'll be
[69:59] next week um if it's not next week it'll probably be the week after that
[70:04] we'll probably have um maybe niles on somebody on to talk about the proposal stuff
[70:17] itself um we may actually wait to uh to get a user the user interface on that before we demonstrate that but that is coming as well so uh with
[70:24] that we'll say see you later guys thanks for tuning in and we'll see you next week
