## Episode Description

Discussion about forming pshenmic.dev as a new Dash-Funded Organization, focusing on building on Dash Platform and establishing an independent development team.

## Episode Summary

This conversation centers on the launch of pshenmic.dev as a standalone Dash-Funded Organization, its underlying strategy, and how it plans to leverage Dash Platform’s capabilities. The speakers outline the reasoning behind transitioning from the Dash Incubator into a self-sustaining group, emphasizing how a dedicated team can accelerate development while enhancing transparency and accountability. Key points include the utility of data contracts on Dash Platform for on-chain accounting, the use of “credits” to reward contributors, and ways this model encourages more independent Dash-funded projects. The participants also highlight the practical steps involved—ranging from storing tasks and claims on Dash Platform to processing payouts—showing how these features will be managed through client-side applications. Throughout, they underscore the broader vision of growing a diverse ecosystem of organizations that develop on Dash, all striving to foster wider adoption and stronger governance.

## Chapters

### 00:00 - 03:00 Introduction and Purpose

In the opening moments, the hosts greet viewers and acknowledge the date’s holiday, noting their intent to keep pushing forward despite the occasion. They briefly set the stage for the discussion, explaining that Mikhail is about to announce a significant step toward forming his own Dash-Funded Organization (DFO). The hosts highlight that this conversation reflects a broader strategy: to encourage more teams to transition from the Dash Incubator to fully independent structures, thus enhancing the overall ecosystem.

They illustrate how this approach aligns with Dash’s goals of fostering creativity and accountability. By nurturing separate entities under the Dash umbrella, everyone can test new ideas, refine processes, and create value. Even in these early minutes, it’s clear that they see Mikhail’s transition as a prototype for how future groups might graduate from the incubator model. Viewers learn that the synergy among independent yet interlinked teams can lead to a more robust, diversified community.

### 03:00 - 06:00 Evolving the Dash Incubator Model

This segment shifts focus to the history and objectives of the Dash Incubator. The host references a vision from seven years ago for growing the number of Dash-funded organizations, explaining how the ecosystem has gradually evolved. They spotlight the fact that Dash Core Group has historically received most of the treasury’s budget, with smaller allocations going to other initiatives. Moving forward, the aim is to see more organizations—like pshenmic.dev—occupy a meaningful portion of funding and development responsibilities.

A key point raised is the importance of independence for teams that have outgrown the incubator’s structure. By taking on their own proposals and budgets, such teams are better positioned to define their work scope, manage projects directly, and engage more contributors. This process, however, hinges on each team’s readiness to operate sustainably outside the incubator, indicating a milestone that demonstrates both their maturity and the incubator’s effectiveness in fostering new initiatives.

### 06:00 - 12:00 pshenmic.dev’s Team and Ambitions

Here, Mikhail outlines the composition of his core team, emphasizing a blend of front-end, back-end, and design expertise. He describes how they’ve built momentum on projects like the Platform Explorer, with recent hires ramping up the development pace significantly. This growth, while beneficial, has also placed pressure on the existing budget—one of the catalysts for establishing pshenmic.dev as a separate DFO.

The conversation underscores how a dedicated team can respond swiftly to community needs and continuously enhance user experiences. Mikhail talks about the range of contributions, from UX improvements to critical back-end fixes, showcasing the group’s adaptability. The proposed plan envisions pshenmic.dev taking on a variety of Dash-focused tasks while maintaining transparent records of every contribution, all backed by on-chain data to affirm accountability and sustain progress.

### 12:00 - 18:00 Budgeting and Transparency through Dash Platform

Mikhail delves into the mechanics of pshenmic.dev’s financial structure, explaining the combination of fixed compensation for his management role and a task-based payout system for other contributors. He stresses that transparency is a major priority, which is why they plan to store all relevant budgeting and task details on Dash Platform. The aim is to ensure that anyone can verify expenditures, track project milestones, and see exactly where the treasury funds are allocated.

This innovative use of Dash Platform also paves the way for more advanced features like credit-based payments and potential automated claims. While acknowledging that some functionalities—like withdrawal of credits—are still in development, Mikhail and the hosts see these steps as instrumental in refining the platform and demonstrating its real-world utility. By testing its limits, they hope to encourage broader use cases and inspire future teams to adopt similar approaches.

### 18:00 - 25:00 Technical Flow and Purchasing Documents

During this chapter, Mikhail details how tasks, claims, and payouts might operate on Dash Platform. The group discusses how developers could submit completed work via a “claim” document, update its status, and set a price for the task. Mikhail envisions a simple “purchase” process wherein pshenmic.dev’s main identity buys the claim document from the developer’s identity, instantly transferring credits and marking the task complete.

This section highlights the shift toward client-side operations, reducing reliance on centralized servers. The hosts point out that while some features are not yet fully enabled, the groundwork for a more decentralized, transparent approach is already laid. By storing crucial information on Dash Platform, pshenmic.dev aims to turn the development and reward process into an open, trustworthy system, benefiting not just the team itself but also anyone monitoring or potentially joining the project.

### 25:00 - 32:00 Transition Timeline and Future Growth

Attention then turns to the practicalities of leaving the incubator. Mikhail clarifies that his final Dash Incubator proposal will overlap with pshenmic.dev’s inaugural proposal, providing enough funding to bridge the gap for current development commitments. This transition underscores the incremental nature of establishing a new DFO: it requires both community support and sufficient time to ensure a stable handover for ongoing projects and contributors.

The hosts emphasize how this model paves the way for other incubator strategists to follow suit. As more teams build their reputations and capabilities, they can break off to form distinct organizations, each tailored to specific goals and skill sets. Rather than acting as competitors, these groups strengthen Dash’s decentralized ecosystem, creating a network of independent yet cooperative entities that push innovation and keep the community vibrant.

### 32:00 - 40:17 Broader Vision and Closing Thoughts

In the final chapter, the discussion expands to illustrate the broader framework of multiple independent Dash entities. The host mentions upcoming moves by other strategists who might soon propose their own organizations, reinforcing the vision of a diversified treasury distribution. They also hint at future tools, like Dash Platform libraries and user-friendly interfaces, that will streamline proposal creation and data storage on-chain.

Concluding remarks focus on ongoing collaboration. Mikhail is invited to return for future Incubator Weekly sessions to share progress, even after establishing pshenmic.dev as a separate DFO. The participants reiterate that the ultimate aim is to strengthen Dash by providing more avenues for new and existing teams to flourish. By encouraging each group to run its own operations openly and systematically, they hope to nurture a more resilient and resourceful Dash ecosystem over time.

## Transcript

[00:00] All right, we're live. Welcome everybody to Incubator Weekly today. I guess it's a US
[00:10] holiday or something, Labor Day, something like that, but we're plugging along. I never really
[00:16] did recognize those government fluff holidays anyway. So today we've got Mikhail on the show
[00:25] and Anthony is my co-host. We're discussing a new Dash-funded organization, aka DFO, that is
[00:37] in the works with Mikhail. And I guess we'll go ahead and just give us
[00:46] a couple sentences of what you're announcing, Mikhail, and then I'll probably jump off with
[00:51] a little bit of a five-minute prequel. And then we'll jump into your slides after
[00:55] that. Yeah, for sure. So basically, a new DFO called chenmig.dev is going to be
[01:09] launched very soon. We previously worked within the Dash Incubator framework, but yeah, I think
[01:17] we kind of overcome this and yeah, we are going to make a whole new
[01:26] system, just somewhat similar to Dash Incubator, basically, yeah, inherits some flow of how developers
[01:38] and strategies work together. Yeah, great. And in many ways, this is, we called the
[00:00] show hatching soon, rather than launching soon. Just to go along with the incubator theme,
[01:54] the idea of the incubator has somewhat evolved over the years, but it's always had
[00:00] a certain kernel of my my ultimate goal is to have more Dash funded organizations,
[02:12] more independent Dash funded organizations working for Dash Dash directly. And this is a great
[00:00] step in that direction. Incubator is, is and will continue to be a place to
[00:00] get started. But in the past, you know, we have been we've have held, not
[00:00] held hostage in any way that we have held developers within the incubator for probably
[00:00] longer than we should have. And we're, we're fixing that. So you and I, Mikhail
[02:40] had a conversation about it. Mikhail Khan: A conversation a couple weeks ago, where we
[00:00] discussed the idea of, hey, let's, let's get you hatched. And you got you were
[00:00] thinking the same thing, basically. So I wanted to share my screen now, Anthony, if
[00:00] you could, if you could go over that just to talk briefly, this will probably
[03:02] be five minutes or so. Mikhail Khan: Seven years ago, seven years ago, it's hard
[00:00] to believe it's been that long. I don't know if my screen shows this timeline,
[03:14] but seven years ago, I submitted a proposal, Mikhail Khan: discussing how we would scale
[00:00] the Treasury. And I, I said, we would, I was proposing that we scale through
[00:00] cooperatives, that term never really caught on. And instead, the term that we're using these
[03:35] days is Dash funded organizations. Mikhail Khan: It's a little bit sad, because I think
[00:00] cooperatives is a better word, because it kind of emphasizes that idea of, we're all
[00:00] cooperating together in Dash, you know, DCG, and Dash Incubator, and Dash Growth, and we're
[03:53] all cooperating together, Mikhail Khan: to create the shared vision of Dash, Dash funded organizations
[00:00] more technically accurate, I guess, because the the idea is that these are organizations that
[04:08] would get funding from the, from the Treasury. Mikhail Khan: And, but the question still
[00:00] remains, like how, how to do how to do that. And back when I submitted
[04:20] this proposal, I was discussing some of my ideal scenarios. Mikhail Khan: And I won't,
[00:00] I won't play this video, it will drop a link to it in the description.
[00:00] But I started out by kind of painting the picture of different years of 2015
[04:35] 2016 2017. Mikhail Khan: What, what, what did the Treasury look like, and so I
[00:00] lumped it into Dash Core Group. Back then there was the organization called Dash Detailed,
[04:47] which was a Pete and Amanda had a little media. Mikhail Khan: Organization and then
[00:00] Dash Force with Joel and Mastermind and Mark Mason. Those were the three main organizations
[00:00] and then there were a bunch of independent, kind of contractors where it was just
[05:05] like solo developers that were submitting proposals to do this, that and the other. Mikhail
[00:00] Khan: And this is kind of what it looked like where you had this kind
[05:12] of breakdown where most of it was obviously going to Dash Core Group. Mikhail Khan:
[00:00] But parts of it were going to other organizations. I'll skip through here. I have
[00:00] a got got this in pie chart, pie chart format for how it looked back
[05:27] then. And it looked something like this, where about 71% was going to DCG. Mikhail
[00:00] Khan: And then small 3.5% going to the other two organizations and then 21% going
[00:00] to other independent organizations. Now, I don't know exactly how it looks these days, but
[00:00] I think it looks very similar. And if, if, if not, maybe even this blue
[05:51] portion for, for Dash Core Group would be even bigger these days. Mikhail Khan: Um,
[00:00] where, uh, then we would have Dash Incubator, Dash Growth, Dash Italia, other organizations, and
[00:00] then a bunch of small independent ones still. So it looked very similar to how
[00:00] it looks today. Um, and here, here were the independent contractors, uh, 2015, 2016, 2017.
[06:20] Now that's kind of what it looked like when it looked like. Mikhail Khan: Back
[00:00] then. And it's still my, my vision to continue to actually, um, get this, these
[00:00] colored sections higher. And so that's, that's the idea here with, um, Shenmik.dev. It sounds
[00:00] a little bit like more of an independent contractor, but you do have a team.
[00:00] Uh, it's not just you, it's you and several other people. Um, so yeah, you
[06:49] would be one of these colored slots. Mikhail Khan: Um, but yeah, I'd, I'd still
[00:00] like to see lots of different colored organizations making up the hole here. Uh, so
[00:00] today is, is, uh, yeah. Presenting your new organization that, that you're going to be,
[00:00] uh, leading out. So why don't we switch over to your, uh, presentation and talk
[07:16] about what you have in mind. Mikhail Khan: Sure. Um, okay. Can you see it.
[00:00] Yep. Cool. Uh, so yeah. Um, let me start with it. Uh, so let me
[00:00] start with, with the, all of our prior work. Well, with the previous, uh, work
[07:43] that we, we've been doing. So I think last, like. Mikhail Khan: Like two years
[00:00] or at least one, one, one and point half years, uh, we've been working with,
[00:00] within the dash and co-better framework, uh, dash and co-better rules. Uh, yeah. And there
[08:01] were. Mikhail Khan: A lot of different projects and, uh, we've been doing different stuff
[00:00] and we've been growing, uh, at first I was, uh, working, uh, I love almost
[00:00] alone. And, you know, then, um, I became a strategist. Uh, I, I, I started
[08:21] involving some different people into our projects. Mikhail Khan: And we started growing and, uh,
[00:00] growing on and on and on, you know, and, uh, yeah, right now we, we
[08:37] just, I think we, we just really overgrew. Mikhail Khan: Like to dash incubator in
[00:00] term, like, uh, we've got a pretty decent team already and, uh, we got all
[00:00] the tasks. Um, like there, there is a constant, uh, task incoming from the community,
[08:57] from, uh, our other projects, uh, that I manage. Mikhail Khan: And yeah, the presence
[00:00] of developers are increasing and, um, the ask from the community for doing certain things
[00:00] are increasing. And yeah. Um, so putting the dash incubator, it's like, um, it's going
[00:00] okay, but, uh, it's still, I think, uh, that we need, uh, we need to
[09:24] expand and like, um, Mikhail Khan: Um, that's why we're going into separate DTO because
[00:00] yeah, we need no real reason to, for, for you to be in the incubator
[00:00] anymore after you've, yeah, you've got, yeah. Yeah. That's your team. So the incubator. Yeah.
[00:00] Is. I'll actually talk about this a little bit more after, after you talk after
[00:00] your presentation, but as a brief preview, I I'm going to try to be moving
[09:51] in this Mikhail Khan: direction with not just, uh, your team, you Mikhail patching from
[00:00] the incubator, but, but also, uh, pretty much all the others in time. So I'll
[10:02] talk about that afterwards. Mikhail Khan: So who do we have now, right now, our
[00:00] core team consists of four developers. This is including me, including Alexei, who works on
[00:00] the front end and do, and really do really awesome job on the platform explorer.
[00:00] Um, uh, there is also an L351, which is really, really helped me with the
[10:25] backend work. Uh, Mikhail Khan: Uh, he helps various projects. Uh, well, he started with
[00:00] a platform explorer. He still, uh, creates really a lot of pull requests into platform
[00:00] explorer backends, uh, backend part. And he also works on other projects. Like, uh, he
[10:47] already fixed the inside, uh, UI that was bothering us for the past, Mikhail Khan:
[00:00] like half year and yeah, and he basically really do backend stuff and he knows
[00:00] what he is doing. So, uh, and we also have, uh, UX designer. Um, his,
[00:00] uh, tag is black mirror designer. Oh, sorry. There is a typo, but yeah, it's
[11:09] black mirror designer. Sorry about that. Uh, Mikhail Khan: Uh, yeah. So he really helps
[00:00] us with the UX. So we already see that platform explorer changed really drastically. Like,
[00:00] uh, um, in sense of like UX, uh, the design really, really improved from what
[11:25] we had. Um, Mikhail Khan: Yeah. And there is, uh, and there is, uh, a
[00:00] lot of work in improving and still, uh, we got a really a lot of
[00:00] ideas about different pages that we have. We like have really, really great homepage, but
[00:00] there are some different places that should be still improved. Yeah. And yeah, he helps
[00:00] us a lot with this. So this is our like core team. And we also
[11:53] have some part-time contributors. Uh, we have another front end, which, uh, Mikhail Khan: helps
[00:00] us with some part-time tasks. Uh, we have an article writer, uh, which already did
[00:00] an awesome, uh, dashmate set up even old article, which posted on the medium and
[12:13] on the Russian resource called Haber Haber. And, uh, yeah. Mikhail Khan: Um, so he
[00:00] also like, um, um, we also preparing some other articles about how platform like works,
[00:00] how to use dash SDK and stuff like that. We also have some occasional decontributors
[12:31] like, uh, Mikhail Khan: Uh, yeah. So it was just, uh, uh, uh, uh, like
[00:00] occasionally, and now there are some people that just contribute and we have some occasional
[12:59] contributors. Uh, yeah. So, uh, Yeah, so recently we came into some budgeting things within
[13:16] the dash incubators. I think the main reason was that our current proposal, our budgeting
[13:23] proposal was based on our previous work, which was basically involved me and Alexei, so
[13:31] we were working, just two of us mainly, we were working during the previous proposal,
[13:39] Q2 incubator proposal, and yeah, the amount of requested funds was based on that, and
[13:50] in the June/Jule we have increased our team members, and it seemed they are working
[13:58] really, really good, so yeah, we increased our development flow, our, like, amount of tasks
[14:08] and issues completed. Yeah, and yeah, it comes with the budget spending, and we can,
[14:20] right now we have, like, tight, pretty tight budget for our team. Yeah, so how
[00:00] the budgeting work will work for the new DFO called PsenmingDev. So let's say we
[14:32] have a 400 dash proposal, which I will, I will start with 400 in the
[14:41] next month, but we will need at least twice more than that. That's because we,
[14:47] we will still have a next month from the dash incubator, but we also will,
[14:58] like, but I will also submit a new proposal for PsenmingDev DFO, which will add
[00:00] another 400 and overall it should be 800 for the next month. Yeah. But yeah,
[15:06] let's just, as an example, let's take a 400. There will be a fixed price
[15:13] for my management and, like, all of the work that I do because it's really,
[15:22] really hard. It's, that was some, like, kind of, it's hard to itemize all of
[00:00] the work that, that I do. Like, I do different projects, I do management, I
[15:30] do research tasks, I do infrastructure, basically, really a lot of work which can be
[15:40] really broken down into separate tasks and it takes time to fill all the tasks.
[15:50] So I think it's not really fitting, like, uh, uh, fit my work, like, in
[00:00] the task-based payout scheme. So there, there will be a fixed price, a monthly price
[15:57] for, for my management and the dev work research, and there will be a task
[16:04] budget reserve, uh, which will be spread among the developers. Uh, yeah. This doesn't look
[16:11] like it's the scale, but that's fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It may be
[16:25] another part, but yeah. Yeah. Um, so yeah, and we plan to, we plan to
[00:00] use the Dash platform to do all the stuff, all of the budgeting. We, we
[16:32] plan to move everything to Dash platform that will, uh, that will really, that will
[16:41] be really, really great for several things. Like, first one is that we will have
[16:51] all of, like, all of the accounting that, uh, is happening within the DPO uh,
[00:00] will be forever locked into the blockchain. Uh, so if we like, uh, uh, uh,
[17:02] if we keep all of the projects, all of the tasks, all of the claims
[17:07] and rewards within Dash platform, it will vary forever. So anyone will be able to
[00:00] verify, uh, how many funds we spent on which task, on which projects. Uh, right
[17:17] now, Dash incubator has, uh, just, uh, Google doc, uh, Google doc, uh, document, you
[17:24] know, and it's anybody can just really delete everything from this. It can be wiped
[17:32] out and stuff like that. But with a, we will post everything into Dash platform
[17:40] that will live there forever. And, um, another good thing about it, that, uh, that,
[00:00] uh, Dash platform already has all necessary functions, uh, to make happen. Like the payout,
[17:50] uh, can be given in, in the credits and I will show you how, how
[17:55] this going to work. So basically, uh, just to give you a little break for
[18:04] a minute. Um, I, uh, I'm really looking forward to to that stuff on con
[18:11] on platform because, uh, incubator itself, we've always had that plan to move over to
[00:00] dash platform when it was stable. Um, but we, and we actually did do that
[18:19] a couple of years ago, we actually started that process, but it was obviously premature.
[18:26] So you're saying that you're actually going to have create a data contract on class
[18:31] on dash platform. And that's, that's where you'll do all of your document storage. Uh,
[18:37] I think this is, this is great because then I don't have to do it,
[00:00] uh, for incubator. I can just take a look at copying, uh, your contract, making
[18:44] some, some different, uh, tweaks to, to that, uh, for my purposes in the incubator,
[18:52] which will, uh, be going forward. Um, and it will be a, a, a pattern
[18:59] that other people can then follow, uh, so that, yeah, it makes it easy for,
[00:00] uh, the network to S to have that transparency, um, and just have a template
[19:08] that they can start. Anybody can start their own, um, yeah, their own organization from.
[19:14] So. And are you going to be creating like a front end along with the
[19:20] data contract or just a data contract? Yeah. Uh, we already have a website called
[19:27] chainmek.dev. Uh, I think we will implement some new interfaces for, for it. Like, uh,
[19:34] there will be page for projects that will query the documents from the dashboard. There
[00:00] is already projects, but yeah, there will be a tasks, uh, page which will show
[19:40] the current tasks that is in, uh, is in progress and you know, all the
[19:46] tasks and claims, you know, so we will be able to see straight from the
[19:49] web, web interface. Cool. Uh, yeah. So basically how it will work, uh, the data
[20:03] contract, uh, will have, uh, different document types, which basically a different types of storage,
[20:10] you know, uh, we have the data contract, which have different document types, and we
[20:18] have an owner of the data contract, uh, which, uh, will be just me, like,
[00:00] uh, I will have, I will hold the private keys of the identity of this
[20:25] identity. And yeah, in the projects, we can fill all of the projects that we
[20:32] have. We can, uh, fill the name, name description, uh, what else, uh, GitHub link,
[20:39] for example, and stuff like that, some metadata for every project, like, uh, for example,
[20:49] images and stuff like that. Um, uh, we can also fill all of the tasks.
[00:00] Then we will have a claims where developers will submit, uh, completed work, uh, referenced,
[21:00] uh, by the task. Uh, and then we will have probably a rewards, uh, storage,
[21:08] uh, document type, which will hold the information about, like, when it was, uh, when,
[21:18] when, what happened, like, you know, when the new, uh, when new funds will arrive,
[21:23] and, you know, when, when the balance was, was making stuff like that, but That's
[00:00] the payouts. Yeah. Yeah. Just one quick note on the last slide, if you could
[21:30] go back. Um, I would, um, one of the benefits, no, no, no, no. Before
[21:38] the benefits of, of doing this, I know that at least I, and maybe others,
[00:00] I would be thinking, is this kind of, is this necessary, um, to do all
[21:48] this stuff? And, and I would say that, um, cause like the most opaque organization
[21:56] could just say, Hey, we just want 400 dash per month. And we're not going
[22:01] to bother with any kind of itemization or any kind of process. Uh, we're just
[00:00] going to take the funds and then it will be black box style and you'll
[22:08] see some websites and some steel eyes and then other things that come out at
[22:14] the other end. Um, but I think that the benefit to this whole approach of
[22:21] putting a contract on platform is not only to help with the transparency and itemization,
[22:27] but also it's just a way to test platform. Like we, we can't have other
[00:00] people using dash platform for serious things until we actually have a serious thing running
[22:34] and relying on dash platform. So I think this is killing two birds with one
[22:41] stone here. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Precisely. Um, yeah. So how, how it's going to work.
[22:52] So we will have an plan mcdef identity, which will own the data contract, uh,
[23:00] and when the new funds from the proposal are coming in, it's going to be
[23:08] instantly converted, uh, to the credits and loaded and topped up into the plan mcdef
[00:00] identity. Uh, then the identity is going to create some projects, some tasks, you know,
[23:16] some public information that developer will use to see what, what they can do, uh,
[23:25] there are tasks, um, they can get what, uh, one task and you know, uh,
[23:36] submit a document with the status like pending, uh, which will, uh, show the admin
[00:00] like me that, uh, there is, uh, some ongoing work happening. Uh, it may also
[23:47] set, uh, price beforehand like, uh, an approximate, uh, estimation of the task. And yeah.
[23:54] So after the task is completed by the developer, it's updating the claim with the
[24:01] status like ready. Uh, it updates, uh, the final price of the document. There is
[24:07] already a method, uh, in the documents, uh, batch transition in the dash platform, which
[00:00] allows you to set a price and then later sell this document to another identity.
[24:14] So what will happen in this case, basically the original owner will receive, uh, the
[24:22] specific number or the specific number of credits that was set where set document price
[24:31] in this document. And it will be, um, like, it will be deducted from the
[24:39] balance of, uh, of the buyer's identity. So basically what will happen after they, uh,
[00:00] update the claim to the status ready, uh, me as a knowner of the identity
[24:48] going to buy out the document called claims, uh, which will basically call a purchase
[24:57] document method, uh, on this document. Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah. Uh, so the owner
[25:07] of this claim will become a chenmig dev and, uh, the original owner of the
[00:00] document is receiving all the credits assigned, uh, to this claim. Uh, so yeah. And
[25:15] then the developer will have, uh, uh, the rewards as an, as a credits in
[25:24] their identity, and then we'll be able to withdraw, uh, uh, from the dash platform
[25:33] and, uh, yeah, do, do what, what they like, uh, with it, like exchange or,
[25:38] you know, sell or, uh, stuff like that. Quick question. Quick question about the, um,
[25:46] the, the logic. Do you plan on having the, the logic to do this, uh,
[25:55] uh, client side, uh, on a client side web application or server side? Uh, I
[00:00] think it's all be, it's all will be at the client side application. So the
[26:01] users as the developers, uh, AK developers, uh, they will be able to create the
[26:09] claims, set appropriate task. Uh, then me as a client, uh, uh, like I will
[26:19] be able to make purchase, uh, methods, uh, initial, like, execute purchase methods. I will
[26:24] be able to insert tasks, but it's all will be done from like client side.
[00:00] There will be no server side, uh, involved, maybe accept the cache. Like, uh, for
[26:31] example, we could, uh, instead of using that inquiry methods for the documents, we can
[26:38] use some platform explorer API to show some documents straight right away, like, uh, uh,
[26:44] as a caching player, but, but yeah, pushing, uh, all of, all of this will,
[26:50] will be done like through the web applications. Good. I was hoping to hear that
[26:58] because, uh, I, I, I would like to think that, uh, like, I think that
[00:00] the dash SDK was designed and the whole dash platform was, was designed somewhat to
[27:06] be done client side. Um, and using, yeah, I think the more we can get
[27:16] away from server side logic, the better. We don't have smart contracts yet, but a
[27:23] lot of, a lot of the things can be done client side. And so it
[00:00] just eliminates one of those, uh, not bottlenecks, but, um, points of centralization, uh, to
[27:33] some degree. Um, so yeah. And I, I think that this will be a good
[27:40] test for using the SDKs. Yeah. Uh, so one note about this is that, uh,
[27:49] we still have, uh, platform credits withdrawals, uh, disabled on the platform side. So for
[27:56] full implementation of this payment flow budgeting, you know, we will need withdrawals enabled. Um,
[28:04] but we will be able to start like, uh, preparing everything like in the test
[28:10] that we can always, uh, like, uh, skip the purchase document part and like pay
[00:00] people in, in just dash, but we will have, uh, we will already have like
[28:19] the data contract and like, uh, how it's going to work like, like the beginning
[28:27] thing things of this, uh, so yeah, but, uh, for the full implementation, we will
[00:00] still need to wait for the withdrawal to be enabled, but yeah, it will work
[28:33] some, something like that. Um, yeah. So let's go to the question answer session. Um,
[28:43] and maybe there are some questions, uh, questions. Yeah. You already have a team, but
[28:49] are you looking for more contributors? Kind of like how, how big are you looking
[28:56] to make this? Uh, uh, I'll be honest right now. We really running pretty, pretty
[29:07] short in terms of funding. And right now we just trying to keep the current,
[00:00] the current load, the current team, and hopefully we can like in the, like in
[29:15] the future, I would like to see more developers coming into our core team, but,
[29:23] uh, but yeah, it's all about the budget. We have tight budget. We still have
[29:32] to, uh, like we have to choose the pro the proper budget because there is
[29:39] still DCG, uh, staff still doing some platform work. There are other, um, DFOs in
[00:00] the treasury. So we kind of limited for at least, uh, September and October, we
[29:45] will have probably a lower, uh, load because yeah, we basically really, really emptied our
[29:56] budgets, uh, because people started really contributing a lot of work. Um, I didn't really
[30:02] thought that it will be like that, but yeah, it's, it's a good and bad,
[30:09] uh, uh, at, at, at once, like, you know, because there are really, really good,
[00:00] good progress, but yeah, we running shirt and that's why we're like, that's why I'm,
[30:20] I'm going to send just 400, you know, uh, that will, that should be, uh,
[30:29] that should be fine for our current team, uh, to, you know, to, to buy
[30:35] a play out without like, you know, a wink and stuff like that. Yeah. We're
[00:00] all, we're all kind of at the mercy of the price of the dash price
[30:42] right now with, with the price as it is, uh, it's, it's hard for us
[30:50] to even maintain. Everybody's, uh, recently been pulling back on, uh, their, their growth. Uh,
[30:58] so that's just the way it is. Unfortunately, with our fixed treasury, um, I have
[31:06] given presentations in the past about why that might not be the best approach, but
[00:00] that is what we have right now. Um, and yeah, I, I'm just looking forward
[31:15] to seeing it. I think I have a couple more things to say, um, regarding
[31:22] my plans going forward with, with the incubator, but, um, any other questions from you,
[31:30] Anthony or, uh, yeah, just, um, for people who do want to follow along with
[31:36] the work that you're doing was the best way to do that. Uh, the central,
[31:45] uh, there will be a proposal, uh, and next proposal will, will include, um, like
[00:00] the work that, that we've done and what's planned and, uh, what funds will be
[31:53] spent for what work, you know, um, the best way to follow is, I think
[32:02] the dash central Twitter, um, this card, uh, it's six right now. Sorry. Uh, yeah.
[00:00] That's the best way to check all our updates and also our website. Um, I
[32:24] try to maintain the updates on the, our website as quick as possible, but yeah,
[32:31] I try to mention all of our updates on the, our website as well. Okay.
[00:00] So you will be submitting a proposal in the next few days here, uh, for
[32:42] gen.dev, uh, DFO. And you do have another, you have a current proposal for your
[32:52] incubator strategist proposal for the incubator. So those will, that will be doubled up this
[33:01] month. Um, so two funding proposals for you this month. Um, that's because you're basically
[33:07] out of budget, like you mentioned. Uh, and so in order to, to keep paying
[00:00] your developers, uh, you need to double up, uh, and, and then this will be
[33:14] the, the current dash incubator proposal that you have, just to be clear, that's the
[33:19] last one that you will have. Um, and then I, I guess that's a good
[33:26] launching point for me to discuss plans going forward with the incubator. Um, so I'll
[00:00] throw my, my screen share up again. So, uh, this was just, uh, we've got
[33:34] the different organizations and dash dash core group, uh, dash hive is where we've done
[33:42] a lot of our, a lot of the work, my corner of the dash incubator.
[00:00] We put a lot of our work in here and I wanted to highlight two
[33:49] projects that I'm going to be focusing on, um, in for the remainder of this
[33:58] quarter and next quarter, hopefully, uh, which is the dash gov. We built a library
[34:07] for submitting proposals, uh, just normal treasury proposals, uh, governance proposals, as it says here.
[34:17] Um, and this doesn't not have a UI on it yet. So I'm going to
[00:00] be putting a user interface onto this and, um, giving people the ability to easily
[34:25] submit dash proposals because again, that kind of fits with my overall goal of getting
[34:33] more, more people in, uh, involved with dash and then dash platform.js, uh, is a
[34:43] library that we've started, uh, in trying to get platform related functions in a very
[34:53] lightweight, uh, easy to use, easy to understand, um, independent library that will, that will
[34:59] be used in conjunction with other libraries that we've built like dash TX, uh, dash
[00:00] phrase dash HD to do platform related things. So in theory, uh, the combination of
[35:07] dash platform.js with, um, with these other libraries would completely, um, yeah, would be a
[35:16] substitute for the existing dash SDK. So the idea would be, um, um, we would
[35:25] have, uh, a website where you can submit a proposal, uh, a net, a normal
[35:34] dash treasury proposal and the body of the proposal using this library, we could submit
[00:00] as a data contract, uh, and, um, um, yeah, document on dash platform. So instead
[35:45] of the body of your proposal living on dash central, for example, or an independent
[35:52] site that you're building, we could have, uh, we will have the ability to, uh,
[35:59] to put your proposal text. Um, we probably support markdown syntax for that, um, um,
[00:00] as a dash platform document and then sites like dash central could, uh, update their
[36:08] sites so that when they see a proposal that has some certain attributes, it would
[36:16] pull the text down from dash platform. And so you have an inversion of control
[36:23] where it's not these individual sites that are hosting the, the body of, uh, um,
[00:00] of proposals, but rather dash platform. So that's another idea of using dash platform in
[36:34] the real world, uh, or at least in our world. Um, so that people in
[36:43] the other real world can, can gain more trust of saying, Hey, there's the, at
[36:51] least these two other projects that are relying on dash platform. Um, internally, it's always
[00:00] good idea to, you know, use your own products so that they get better. The
[36:58] whole idea of dog fooding. Um, so I just want to also mention this is,
[37:07] this is your website, uh, Shenmik, uh, your, your GitHub. Um, so you've got a
[37:13] bunch of, uh, repositories people can check out and then, uh, going forward, Uh, I'm
[00:00] trying to move other strategists in your direction, uh, Mikael, meaning that they will, uh,
[37:22] submit their own proposals and basically hatch from the incubator as their own independent DFOs.
[37:31] So I know that, um, AJ is already interested in this. He's got a, uh,
[37:40] a group or not a group, but a, a brand called digitalcash.dev similar to Genric.dev
[37:48] or digital, yeah, digitalcash.dev. So he'll probably be submitting his own proposals soon. Uh, I've
[37:56] spoken with, uh, Jojo Byte as well. He's, he's, um, probably going to be moving
[00:00] in this direction as well. It might, he might have one more incubator proposal or
[38:03] maybe not. Um, and then Ash, I haven't, uh, been able to get ahold of
[38:09] him yet, but I'm going to be suggesting this, uh, to him as well. So
[38:15] basically trying to get, trying to get people incubated, uh, pro people and projects and
[38:23] teams incubated and independent on their own. And we'll have, we'll bring, uh, incubator back
[00:00] down to kind of a slim place for, for that just incubates projects quickly, uh,
[38:30] and gets them on their, moving on their way to independent proposals, uh, either project-based
[38:38] or, uh, person-based, uh, or even team-based proposals like yourself, Mikael, um, as quickly as
[38:47] possible. And building these tools, like dash gov and dash platform is part of, has
[38:54] been part of that process. So that's, that's the plan going forward for incubator. Um,
[00:00] yeah. So I think with that, we've covered kind of a lot of ground, but,
[39:04] uh, only in 39 minutes. So I think that that's probably a pretty good place
[39:10] to, to leave it unless anybody else has anything else they wanted to add. Um,
[39:17] what I will add is just, I will, uh, so just to subscribe to all
[39:25] our, our, like, uh, social, like, uh, and, you know, like, and subscribe this video
[00:00] if you didn't. Um, yeah. Yeah. And I forgot to mention that I, I do
[39:34] want to continue to have, uh, folks like you, Mikael, and, and even, even when
[39:41] people do their independent move, um, I'd like to have them on incubator weekly just
[39:48] to, um, check in with them and, and talk about what they're, what they're up
[00:00] to present their projects. Um, it's not something that would be necessary, obviously just an
[39:53] option. Um, if you have your own media outlet that you wanted to build, then,
[40:00] uh, gaining traction on your own, uh, and your own site would be totally fine
[40:06] with me. But if not, then this is always a place to present your projects.
[00:00] So, uh, let's see. Yeah. Lexi says fuel rock, the rocket next up to the
[40:17] moon. We'll see about that. Um, I think that's what we're all hoping for. With
[00:00] that, I think we'll say bye for now. See you around. See you guys.
