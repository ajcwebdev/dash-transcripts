## Transcript

[00:00] >> Okay. We're live. >> All right. Welcome, everyone. Today we
[00:10] have our incubator quarterly call. Glad to have you guys with us. Mikhail and Jojobyte.
[00:16] >> What's up, guys? >> Hello.
[00:19] >> And Anthony, you're stepping in for Ash, right?
[00:23] >> I am now Ash. >> Just kidding. Yeah, Ash may be joining
[00:29] us later in the call today. Hopefully he'll be able to get here at the end at least. But
[00:35] we will go ahead right now. And anything to say just generally before we get started on
[00:43] each of our individual -- so what we'll go over is we'll go over each of our proposals.
[00:49] We will talk about what we did in the last quarter, what we funded, and what we're planning
[00:55] on working on this coming quarter. And we'll just do that by going through each of our
[01:01] proposals on Dash Central. Yeah. So Michael Cluster says where's Ash? Ash is our other
[01:10] -- he does have a proposal up this quarter. But there may have been some miscommunication
[01:15] about the time. So we'll see if he joins us today. I know it's a little earlier for him.
[01:21] But we'll see if he joins us. And if not, feel free to ask any questions. And we'll
[01:26] also cover his proposal at the very end. If he's here, he can talk about it. If not, we'll
[01:32] just skim through the proposal visually so that everybody can see it on the screen.
[01:37] So with that, Mikhail, we'll go ahead and start with you. And Anthony, because we have
[01:44] just the four of us today, I think we might as well keep you on the screen here. It was
[01:47] going to be crowded with five people on the screen. But I think four is doable with the
[01:51] screen share. It stacks up quite nicely. So let's go ahead and do that. We'll add myself
[01:59] to the screen. And then -- yeah. So this is my proposal. I'm not going to talk about my
[02:05] proposal in detail just yet, other than to say this is kind of a summary of all of our
[02:14] incubator proposals this quarter. So we have me requesting 350 Dash. Ash is requesting
[02:21] 200 Dash. He hasn't requested any funds for about a year. So in fact, I think it was exactly
[02:30] one year ago that he requested his last one. Mikhail, requesting 400 Dash, and Jojobite
[02:36] requesting 400 Dash as well. And then we will just jump straight into your proposal, Mikhail,
[02:44] and talk about that first. >> Yeah, yeah. Sure. Let me show you what
[02:50] we've done and what we are working on. So in the last quarter, most of the budget went
[02:59] to the Platform Explorer. So there was really quite huge work. So the changes both internally,
[03:07] like it's in the backend, in the indexer, and also on the frontend. You can see the
[03:13] new homepage that received a huge redesign. And more UX improvement is coming. We got
[03:26] a slight increase in our team. So we have more people working on the Platform Explorer
[03:31] and possibly other projects. Yeah. Currently, it's me. It's Alexey who is doing the frontend.
[03:41] There is an owl, which is our new backend developer, which works on some backend stuff
[03:49] on the Platform Explorer. We also have now a UX guy. He's working part-time, but he helped
[03:55] us with some interfaces on the Platform Explorer and also other projects. And Dan is also a
[04:06] new frontend developer. We just onboarded him. He's already done some tasks, so they
[04:15] are already in review. So yeah. >> Great. This is awesome to see. Just a side
[04:23] note. I love seeing you build up your team instead of just solo Mikhail doing lots of
[04:30] stuff. One of the main things that I'm hoping is that Dash can scale. We've done pretty
[04:40] well with our own little teams here, but the question is, can we actually get more people
[04:48] involved in Dash? Not just in the incubator and not just as proposal owners, but just
[04:56] are we able to get developers interested in Dash and Dash Platform at a higher scale than
[05:03] we are right now? So that's good to see. >> Yeah, sure, sure. So yeah, now we have pretty
[05:14] decent team. It's two frontend developer, backend developer plus me. So now we can get
[05:24] a little bit more since now. So expect more features to see on the Platform Explorer and
[05:31] other projects. >> I'm just going to open this up real quick
[05:33] since we've got some time, just so that people can see it, what you're referring to, Platform
[05:40] Explorer here. Do you want to talk about this briefly? Because I know this is like your
[05:45] project. >> Yeah, so the homepage of the Platform Explorer
[05:51] previously was, it was kind of simple. It was just showing the latest transactions list
[05:57] and just some network parameters. So right now we redesigned everything. We put some
[06:07] trending lists about some platform entities that people would like to see. We did a status
[06:13] block, which now shows the status of the network and the Platform Explorer, which is different
[06:20] because sometimes network may be up, but Platform Explorer is lagging or have some issues. Or
[06:28] there could be a network is down while Platform Explorer is working. So we can now clearly
[06:33] see what's going on. Yeah, some beautiful stats, like transactions to history and stuff
[06:43] like that. So we actually already have a redesign of the homepage, but that will happen in the
[06:50] next quarter. So it will receive much more beautiful and important information.
[07:01] >> I noticed, I just wanted to talk about, ask about this, this one, not DPNS, but you
[07:07] have this new Platform Explorer contract as well. Do you want to talk a little bit about
[07:12] that? >> Yeah, yeah. That's the feature that recently
[07:17] was added to the Platform Explorer. So basically we made a Platform Explorer data contract
[07:23] that data contract developers can use to make their data more recognizable and they can
[07:32] apply and they can set an alias, a custom name for their data contracts on Platform
[07:39] Explorer. So it works like that. Developer creates a data contract in the network. Then
[07:47] they can submit a document in our Platform Explorer data contract with identifier of
[07:57] your created data contract and its name. And then Platform Explorer will pick it up from
[08:03] the network and will assign a custom name and it will be shown on the website on the
[08:07] front end. >> Got it.
[08:10] >> Yeah. So right now, yeah, for now it's just Platform Explorer and system data contract
[08:17] that are there, but yeah. Yeah, we plan to add some sort of slider or stuff like that
[08:26] and that will show not just six of it, but also some more user-defined data contract
[08:34] names. Yeah. Yeah. We also added the validators page, which shows currently active validators.
[08:45] And we can see also inactive, which was active. Actually, there are also inactive masternodes,
[08:51] but masternodes are working like in quorums. So there are only 25 active nodes in the moment.
[09:00] >> Okay. So inactive doesn't mean like invalid or ban or anything like that. It just means
[09:08] they're not in a quorum. >> Yes. Yeah. Soon we will add a chart for
[09:14] proposed blocks of the validators on the specific validators page that will show where it was
[09:25] proposing blocks, when there was proposing blocks. And chart something like on mining
[09:31] pool websites where you can see that your miner is still working and stuff like that.
[09:37] >> And you also have this API page, which is last page.
[09:40] >> Yeah. Yeah. API. Yeah. Anyone can use this API to build things or query things from Planet
[09:48] One Explorer. This is mostly for the website itself, but maybe someone will find this useful.
[09:54] >> Right. So you build the API and the API mostly or exclusively serves this website
[10:00] itself. But in theory, anybody could use the API and put up their own Explorer, or if they
[10:09] just need a certain part of platform's information, they can get a display that on their page.
[10:16] Got it. All right. Back to the... >> What's next? Yeah. Yeah. We also added
[10:23] a DPNS name support in the indexer. It's not on the front end yet, but soon we should see
[10:30] some features like search by dash names. And you can see in the identity which aliases
[10:39] was assigned to this given identity. Yeah. Stuff like that. Also, there was a lot of
[10:49] work on the infrastructure to keep back-end working as it should. And yeah. On the side
[11:01] of the dash mate, there were no major tasks. There were some bug fixes. And one important
[11:09] feature that was merged is the DKG exchange session check. So when you stop your dash
[11:19] mate node, it checks if there is an upcoming key exchange session of your master node.
[11:28] So it's potentially dangerous to restart your node in this moment. So it checks before you
[11:34] stop your node and warn you about this so you can make it a bit later.
[11:42] Electrum dash is on like -- it's not on hold, but there were no much work on the side of
[11:52] Electrum, but we keep all of this infrastructure. We keep it live. And yeah. Soon there should
[12:02] be Dash Core V21, which I will ensure that it will be working with Electrum.
[12:10] Okay. Yeah. So my plans is like to keep working on
[12:18] the platform explorer. There will also XDify integration. Sorry, I forgot to mention that.
[12:25] Okay. I was going to ask, but -- Yeah. So yeah, XDify is like I believe is our partner.
[12:35] So it's a wallet, non-custodial wallet, and also a decentralized exchange -- oh, no. It's
[12:43] just transferring NFTs. So it's just -- you can buy NFTs with XDify wallet. It is also
[12:50] use this authentication method on the Maya decentralized exchange. So there is an extension.
[13:01] So basically it misses support of the Dash, but they said that if we add support of Dash
[13:07] in their SDK, then they will be able to add support of the Dash in their wallet.
[13:14] So they did give you verbal confirmation? Yeah. That's what they said, that they will
[13:23] add the support of Dash in their wallet. So the SDK is there to support the Dash.
[13:31] And yeah, I contacted with developers of the XDify. So we are in touch. And yeah, I created
[13:38] a pull request. I made all the code, which is now in review from the XDify site. So they're
[13:44] kind of busy. So I hope they will soon should get on it.
[13:52] Yeah. So my plans is to continue working on the Platform Explorer. There are also other
[13:59] projects that I would like to build, but mostly the work of the -- like what I do is Platform
[14:06] Explorer. There should be much more UX improvements. We should add separate Platform Explorer instances
[14:14] for each network. So there will be a network selector with the subdomains where you can
[14:21] choose the network, mainnet, testnet, possibly some devnets.
[14:26] That would be very helpful. I think a lot of people probably want to develop locally
[14:32] rather than working with a testnet or just developing on mainnet for a variety of reasons.
[14:39] So that would be helpful.
[14:41] Sure, sure. Yeah. Also, the Dash Platform should come with the NFT support. So we would
[14:49] like to build something like an NFT collection page where you can see all collectibles on
[14:54] the Dash Platform, which users submitted. Not sure how it works exactly yet, but we
[15:04] will figure this out, like how we will build it and how the UX will be working on the website.
[15:12] Okay.
[15:13] Also the platform console, GrowDB console, which lets you query the platform state straight
[15:21] from the browser. So there is a GrowDB with its own query syntax. So I think it's a good
[15:30] thing to have, to have this tool instrument that allows you to straight do those queries
[15:37] straight from the console and get the data straight from the state. That will be useful
[15:45] for developers which are working on the Dash Platform dApps.
[15:49] Yeah.
[15:50] Yeah, yeah. So there should be some useful DashMate features soon. We're already in touch
[16:01] with the platform team. There are some tasks that we want to do before the mainnet release
[16:08] to give people. So some things like, for example, DashMate Doctor, which tests your configuration,
[16:17] your, like, so in case of issues, you can generate the archive with, with all logs,
[16:29] you know, all of your stages, all of the system information that people could share with the
[16:35] team in case of some chain halt or some issues. Yeah. Yeah. So basically we're preparing for
[16:45] production of the Dash Platform. So yeah, we're working.
[16:52] Yeah. Release is scheduled for two weeks from today. So that's when the binaries get released
[16:59] anyway, but it won't be, won't be on mainnet for several weeks. I'm guessing after that,
[17:05] maybe even more than a month. But I also heard from Sam, BCG CTO, that they're also committing
[17:17] to never wiping testnet from its data as well. So, and I think that I don't remember the
[17:25] date on that, but I think it's coming up close like this week or maybe next week where they'll
[17:30] do a final wipe of the testnet platform data. As far as I know, core has never gone down
[17:37] on testnet. Core has remained up the whole time that testnet has been up, but platform
[17:43] gets wiped out and restarted, has been several times and they've committed to doing one more
[17:51] wipe and then not doing that anymore. So that's actually really good for incubators so that
[17:58] we can maintain continuity with our data so that developers can continue to have reliable
[18:05] data going forward. And obviously we need that on mainnet, so it's good that they're
[18:10] testing that on testnet as well. Yeah.
[18:17] Will DashMate work for production as well as testnet stuff? Or is it already working
[18:25] that way? I haven't used it in a while.
[18:28] It is already working, but there are some specific stuff, like you have to know a version,
[18:35] you have to set some maybe stuff because the team is constantly working, they're upgrading
[18:41] versions. So, but yeah, it's working for testnet and mainnet.
[18:47] Yeah, cool. Did you ever get that blog post written about how to set that up for testnet?
[18:55] Or is that still-
[18:56] I pretty much finished that. I significantly expanded it.
[19:01] Oh, and that was Anthony talking just now, because his icon doesn't like flash and whatnot,
[19:06] like Jojobites does.
[19:07] Yeah, no, I'm about to publish that actually. It's a huge introduction to DashMate that
[19:14] kind of builds on the initial gist.
[19:16] Okay, so you took Mikhail's gist that we covered a week or two ago, and you just went ahead
[19:23] and did your updated blog post on your site, Anthony. Mikhail, go ahead. You were going
[19:30] to do a Medium post, I believe, with that, right?
[19:34] Yeah, yeah. It's already in draft. I started it, but haven't finished it yet. So it's about
[19:39] the local DashMate development quickstart.
[19:44] So as to be distinguished from testnet, there are the three different options, local, testnet,
[19:52] and mainnet coming up. And right now, all we have is, as far as documentation goes,
[19:58] mainnet as far as- well, no, testnet. But yeah, all three should be supported soon and
[20:06] documented.
[20:07] Yeah, so-
[20:08] Go ahead.
[20:09] Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, I will finish the local stuff and then I want to go to the testnet
[20:14] as well, testnet out from DashMate.
[20:18] And I'm personally hoping that DCG can get that documentation into the docs.dash.org
[20:25] as well, because I think that's important for discovery for people that don't know incubator
[20:31] documentation sites. All right, so anything else to say on your side of things, Mikhail?
[20:38] Thanks for that update from the quarter. It looks like a great quarter that you had.
[20:44] Well, I don't know, nothing for me. Okay, but no. All right, Jojobite, would you like
[20:54] to go next or would you like me to go next? Any preference there?
[20:58] I'm fine with either. Up to you.
[21:00] All right, we'll switch over to you then.
[21:04] All righty. So this last quarter has been not as great as Mikhail's for AJ and I. We've
[21:13] had some personal stuff come up, but AJ was able to, so CoolAJ86, I'll say his full username
[21:20] for people who might wonder, CoolAJ86 was able to get to a bunch of the Dash RPCJS stuff
[21:30] and that is used in Dash Join. So I actually have that little summary of Q2 accomplishments.
[21:37] I know AJ has some more stuff that I have left out, but claims will likely be made today
[21:43] and get a few more things pushed. So we'll have a lot of the work on Dash Join for the
[21:51] library side of things done probably later today as far as I'm aware. And sorry, is my
[22:01] mic all right? It keeps turning itself down and I don't know what the audio is like.
[22:07] Yeah, it sounds good. I just wanted to also say while you're maybe thinking about your
[22:11] mic stuff, I also wanted to say that you and AJ, you guys are not full time by any means
[22:21] in Dash. So last quarter, just as a quick update, I'll talk about this a little bit
[22:27] more in my report, but you became a new incubator strategist this quarter. So welcome, first
[22:35] of all, this is your first quarterly report, I believe. But in addition to that, you guys
[22:43] have your own contracts and other things that you're working on because incubator can't
[22:49] fund you full time. It's not like we can expect you to be able to jump on a dime and turn
[22:55] on a dime and start incubator work. So for anybody who doesn't really know how our process
[23:02] goes, we don't fund people for the calendar time. We fund people for completing tasks.
[23:14] And so even if an incubator strategist didn't do any work, that means that they probably
[23:20] also didn't get any pay. So the fact that you didn't work full time shouldn't be any
[23:26] kind of problem other than it's always nicer to get things done sooner, but you guys have
[23:31] other contracts that you're working on and other life events. So just wanted to mention
[23:36] that as well. So go ahead, Joe, your mic sounds fine to me.
[23:41] Thank you for clarifying that. Yeah. As other projects come up, sometimes we have to prioritize
[23:47] other things other than the Dash work, but we are both trying to get back into the Dash
[23:52] work now. And I know we have a bit of budget. I think a lot of it will be gone after AJ
[24:01] gets paid out for his most recent work. And then there's a little bit of budget left for,
[24:07] well, actually most of my side of the budget for wallet and the third party integrations.
[24:14] I'm not sure I will get to the Dash join stuff before the next stuff is funded, but I think
[24:22] we'll be able to get a lot of the third party wallet integrations implemented over the next
[24:30] week or two here.
[24:32] So that's Maya, that's Dash spend, that's... What's the...
[24:42] I had them all listed in the Q2 proposal, but I removed them for some reason from this
[24:47] one. So let me look real quick.
[24:51] No, the other one is Crowdnode and we've got that from a while ago, it's just UI on top
[24:58] of it. We've also got part of the UI done, but yeah.
[25:04] Yeah. And the other thing that I think still needs a bit of work is the transactions. It's,
[25:12] I think 90% there, but might need a little bit more work on my part. And then neither
[25:20] AJ or I were able to get to the Dash proposal stuff. However, the Dash join stuff has been
[25:27] the main priority for us. And as that is close to library ready, I should be able to implement
[25:34] that hopefully soon here.
[25:37] Yeah. So I saw an update from AJ, he's got it working in the browser, but it's not library-ified,
[25:47] meaning it works, but it's not something that a third party could just pick up and say,
[25:55] here's the CoinJoin library that I can integrate for Dash. That's something that you do want
[26:01] to accomplish at some point this quarter, making that into a library, correct?
[26:11] Yep.
[26:12] And then on the Dash proposal.js side of things, I don't know if you, we were at a meetup together
[26:20] recently and I don't know if you were in the conversation at that time, but we're actually
[26:24] going to be streaming the initial work on that today for the library side of things.
[26:33] So the whole purpose, which I'll talk about in more detail on the stream later today,
[26:39] that's going to be with AJ and also Validark, who we've introduced Dash platform to and
[26:45] Dash in general, and he might be working on this. It might be a very simple thing to do
[26:53] because of some of the Dash RPC updates that you've done. So do you want to talk about
[27:00] that a little bit? Like what is Dash RPC.js and what has AJ been doing and why was that
[27:07] necessary for the Dash Join stuff?
[27:10] So as far as I understand it, the Dash RPC is required to actually trigger a lot of the
[27:16] coin join processes and the mixing of the coins. And so AJ has been figuring out what
[27:25] is needed and what he can do. And I believe he's doing it in a vanilla JavaScript way
[27:34] where there shouldn't be any dependencies I'm checking right now.
[27:38] Well, let's just look at this right now. And I understand that he's been doing most of
[27:46] the work here. And so maybe all of it hasn't been communicated back to you. So I don't
[27:51] want to put you on the spot here, but we'll just kind of go through this real briefly
[27:55] just so people can see what he's been working on, I guess.
[27:59] Yeah. So he's actually worked on this for quite a while and only recently got it to
[28:04] where he's been able to demonstrate it's working. And so he has been able to do a coin
[28:12] join mixing on a reg test environment that he's set up. And he's been able to repeat
[28:20] that several times. And I think there's some screenshots.
[28:25] And also, I think streaming was a big part of his latest work where he's got WebSocket
[28:33] support for all of this. So you don't want to have to keep doing manual updates to naturally
[28:42] coin join is naturally kind of a streaming process. So yeah, I'll go back here for now.
[28:50] But feel free to say anything more about that if you want, or just move on to what you're
[28:57] looking forward to this coming quarter.
[28:59] Yeah. So as far as what we're looking forward to, it sounds like the library side of the
[29:09] Dash proposal stuff will likely be handed off to Validark. I don't know if he's going
[29:16] to be doing the UI or not, but I'm happy to do the UI. But if that's the case, hopefully
[29:23] we'll be able to get to that in the next month or two here.
[29:28] And then wallet UI, we want to wrap that up. I think we want to get stage two done as far
[29:39] as the wallet is. And I think we're about halfway through the planned stage two, if
[29:51] I recall correctly. I'm looking it up here, which transactions view was a big one, but
[29:59] there's several things that will be finished off that have been worked on, but we were
[30:04] working out kinks and stuff. So we want to get through as much of stage two as possible
[30:09] and into stage three. And I know we've also shifted some stuff from stage three. I think
[30:16] originally had the third party integrations and we shifted those into stage two. So we
[30:25] might shift things around a little bit, but we should be able to finish up stage two of
[30:30] wallet and have that completed.
[30:33] If you want to send me a link of what you're looking at, great. If not, we can just go
[30:41] on the verbal there. I hear you clicking around. Yeah. Yeah. I was trying to find it. Hang
[30:48] on. I'll drop it in the chat here. Actually, that might not even be the best link. I think
[30:59] we've got a project that's a better... Actually, yes, this is a better link to look at there.
[31:07] Okay.
[31:08] So welcome to the world of project management, Jojo Vite. I know you're primarily a developer,
[31:15] but as we've seen from Mikhail, some of the best project managers are good developers
[31:21] as well. So I'm going to bring this link up that you sent me. And I will also say project
[31:32] managing AJ isn't the easiest thing in the world. All right. So do you want to talk about
[31:39] this a little bit?
[31:40] Yeah. So I had gone through and prioritized a lot of what needs to be done for the roadmap.
[31:46] And I believe everything in here right now is stage two. Some of these are... There's
[31:54] not great indication on the level or amount of work each of these are, but I'd say several
[32:01] of them are bigger. They're going to take several days worth of work and others are
[32:10] probably an hour or two of work. And so I do think we'll be able to finish up a lot
[32:16] of what's in here and then hopefully get what's left in the roadmap that is still in the readme
[32:23] transferred over into this list. But you can also click on, I think the status board tab
[32:33] to the left of that one. Yeah. And that is where it currently stands, where it was left
[32:41] off. So transactions view was in progress as I was last working on it and it is really
[32:47] close to being done. So that will be done. And then third-party integrations will be
[32:52] worked on next with those other ones that are in the ready section.
[32:58] Okay.
[32:59] Yep.
[33:00] And then...
[33:01] Can you go over that a little bit?
[33:05] Yeah. And then I'd also like to test out Dash platform, especially if it's getting to mainnet.
[33:13] So I do have a few ideas I'd like to try. I'll probably map them out a bit more before
[33:20] I do any work, but I figured I'd wait till platform is on mainnet and then invest a little
[33:28] bit of the funds in building some stuff to test out platform and contribute to that side
[33:36] of Dash.
[33:37] Okay. All right. I think that's pretty good then. Let's wait for Ash to see. We'll see
[33:45] if he shows up at the end here. I'll jump over, jump back to my proposal. I talk a little
[33:53] bit about you becoming strategist and what that means far as budgets go. This is today's
[34:02] show and this is just a brief look at my personal strategy budget. Now that we're separate,
[34:13] this is just me personally, not the whole incubator. And as you can see, my reserves
[34:20] are kind of going downhill. And as far as my projection goes, I made my request as low
[34:26] as I could sustain with targeting at the end of the quarter, probably be down to 268 Dash.
[34:38] The last thing that I want is for DCG to have to cut back on their staff at this point where
[34:46] we're finally launching Dash platform on domain net. So I wanted to be sensitive of that with
[34:54] my request. These are the projects that I funded last quarter, Q2, and I'll just talk
[35:04] briefly about each of them. So the PrivateSend SDK, that in the last quarter was funded primarily
[35:12] by me, my budget. And now moving forward, that will be in your budget, Jojobite. Incubator
[35:20] updates, that's kind of like Incubator Weekly, that's what Incubator Weekly is mostly. And
[35:29] Payment Tools is another one of those projects that is mostly done, but every now and then
[35:34] we have to do some updates on our libraries. And that's what this last quarter was as well.
[35:42] That's another one of those things that would probably primarily land in your budget, Jojobite,
[35:48] going forward, as well as the Modern Vanilla Web Wallet. So a lot of this stuff that we
[35:55] worked together on under my budget will be moving to you, and we'll see how well you
[36:02] can do with that with 400 Dash per month, but, you know, we'll see. And let's see, probably
[36:12] the main focus for me this last quarter was this, what we called web framework integrations.
[36:18] That's how the project started, but it ended up being mostly like tutorial walkthroughs.
[36:24] So if you've seen, if anybody's seen our video series on the Dash platform walkthroughs,
[36:31] that's what this is. And then I'll talk a little bit about that more down further.
[36:42] This Merchant Loyalty Credit System, this was work that Jan was doing. And we've talked
[36:50] about that in previous Incubator Weeklys. We had him on the show a couple times. I will
[36:57] probably not be funding this one much more, not because it's not a good project. It is
[37:02] a good project, but it's just, you know, with the budget being tight, that's something that
[37:07] I feel like we've gotten to a point with where he can maybe take that on his own and continue
[37:14] to work on that, which I believe he has plans for, but I'm not sure. So, you know, that's
[37:21] what the Incubator is. We incubate some projects and some of them will go on and some of them
[37:27] will die. But I hope that keeps going because it does have a lot of potential, I think,
[37:33] and it is potentially a good Dash platform project. Although it does do a lot of its
[37:40] work with by sending off return messages on the main net. So it's not like it needs Dash
[37:47] platform, but some of the metadata could be better done on platform. Dash developer relations.
[37:57] This is something that I started last quarter is basically, I'll actually just go down a
[38:04] little further so people can read these descriptions. They're a little bit better than what I'm
[38:11] talking about right now on the screen. But yeah, basically, I attended a conference here
[38:16] in Utah. All the, there's a lot of, there's a very big developer community here in Utah.
[38:22] You know this Jojobite, you're in Utah as well. So I would like to start attending some
[38:32] of the bigger conferences that are right here in Utah where I don't have to do travel expenses
[38:38] and you get pretty good bang for your buck. And one of those developer conferences that
[38:41] came to Utah Park City, Utah, I attended and was able to meet some very influential people
[38:48] in the developer community. And I won't name any names until I actually do some more work
[38:53] with them. But that was good to just kind of rub shoulders with developers, talk about
[38:59] Dash, talk about Dash platform. And hopefully this quarter we can do some more of that and
[39:07] reaching, continue to reach out to web developers, which is primarily, as far as I can, as far
[39:14] as I'm concerned, what Dash platform is created for to facilitate web developers to be able
[39:20] to make dApps, like decentralized applications, very easily using a JavaScript SDK. So let's
[39:32] do some of that. And in this coming quarter, what I'm planning to do is continuing work
[39:39] with developers, doing these platform walkthroughs, testing, testing for documentation, developer
[39:49] experience, performance, what we found out from the last 10. I'll open, let's see, did
[39:55] I have a link to this series on the, yeah, the walkthroughs, just open that up real quick
[40:04] so that people can see who we've been working with. So we did one, two, sometimes it took
[40:12] more than one stream to get through all of our, get through the tutorial, three, four,
[40:19] five, six, seven, eight. And we also have a ninth one that's not on this playlist. And
[40:26] then a 10th one that's scheduled for later today. Anthony, are you still, have you fallen
[40:32] asleep or are you still with us here?
[40:33] I'm here. I'll update the playlist right now.
[40:35] Oh no. I was just going to confirm with you, do we have, when is our 10th platform walkthrough
[40:41] scheduled for?
[40:43] That's today at, in two hours after this basically.
[40:47] Okay. So yeah, we'll, we'll have our 10th developer walkthrough on that after that.
[40:57] And so I'm going to, we're, we probably won't reach out to, well, maybe we'll do 10 more
[41:06] is what I'm thinking, but it, it would probably be mostly yeah. Like I don't want to, I don't
[41:15] want to introduce more people to Dash platform at this point until we have figured out what
[41:23] the issue with our SDK is and what, and if we can potentially fix that. So that's, that
[41:30] goes down to this. There's another item here that I wanted to talk about that. Investigate
[41:35] platform JS SDK issues with the solution, potential solutions as well.
[41:43] In the series, we noticed that there are some parts of platform that some certain calls
[41:52] that take a long time. So we want to investigate that a little bit more. And that's one of
[41:56] the reasons why I'm bringing in valid arc. He's somebody that I, we may task to do this
[42:04] with depending on which route we go. So there's, there's two main solutions to that. I won't
[42:12] go to get into the details because we're already getting long here, but the SDK that DCG is
[42:22] focusing on is the rust SDK. And we could potentially do a wrapper over that to be used
[42:30] in a JavaScript and JavaScript settings, but that has its pros and cons, or we could just
[42:35] try to add platform support to our existing incubator libraries. So those two major approaches,
[42:43] well, there is a third approach, which is basically trying to troubleshoot and fix what's
[42:49] in the existing JavaScript SDK, which is written in JavaScript. So those, those are the three
[42:55] main options. So we need to kind of get the pros and cons of each of those. And we haven't,
[43:00] we haven't dived into that yet, but we, that is something I plan on doing before I open
[43:06] it up to more people because the existing people that we've that we've introduced dash
[43:14] platform to, and that's always come with the caveat that, Hey, this is test net, this is
[43:19] kind of alpha software. And, you know, they're there, but they've been forgiving in that
[43:24] sense. And, you know, for web three, it's actually, it hasn't been too bad considering
[43:30] some of the other alternatives that people have to, you know, other jump hoops that people
[43:35] have to jump through to, to, to build like say Ethereum apps, you know, it's, it's difficult
[43:39] all the way around. We're trying to make it as simple as developing a traditional app
[43:45] and bringing in a different SDK. And that's been the goal. So hopefully we can, we can
[43:50] track that down. The other thing is I've been putting this off for a long time. I became
[43:57] the blockchain Utah meetup organizer a few months ago, and I've been meaning to do some
[44:03] meetups, but it just hasn't been the right time. And I think this quarter for sure is
[44:10] the right time to start doing some of those. Now that we have a release date for dash platform,
[44:17] I would like to, it's a, it's not a dash specific meetup. I do organize the dash specific meetup
[44:22] as well. And I'll invite everybody to that as well. But this one is more general. And
[44:27] so we'd probably start with Bitcoin and eventually cover Bitcoin and Ethereum, but then also
[44:34] eventually cover cross platform or cross chain exchanges like Maya that would introduce dash
[44:42] and then finish up the series with dash or something like that. So this isn't something
[44:49] that people want to just go and talk about dash only for, so it's important that, um,
[44:57] that we prepare people specifically for, you know, it's not just, it's all about blockchain
[45:03] and not just dash. So there would probably be like three or four, um, meetups in that
[45:09] series where we'd go through the different types of blockchains and then we would end
[45:13] it with like, okay, actually dash has quite a bit of all of these things. It has a proof
[45:19] of work chain. It has a proof of stake chain. It has a dash. It can be, um, natively swapped
[45:26] between Bitcoin and Ethereum using Maya, that kind of stuff. So I think now definitely is
[45:31] the right time to do that. Um, and then, yeah, it's, I've been, we've been talking with 88
[45:37] guys as well just recently and they're, they're ready to get started as well. So that's, uh,
[45:44] yeah, that's what my quarter is looking like. Um, I also, uh, I forgot to put this in the
[45:49] proposal, but, um, wanted to mention this at least permissionless, uh, blockchain, 9.4
[46:01] is 88. I, the insurance guys in Brazil or something was that or something like that,
[46:08] right? Yes. Uh, so they have an insurance product that they want to bring on chain and
[46:13] use dash platform for that. Um, cool. There is a very, very prominent, um, meet, uh, not
[46:23] meet up, um, conference coming up called permissionless. This is put on by the bankless guys and the
[46:30] block works guys, uh, together, or at least block permissionless two was, and this, this
[46:36] year they're coming to Salt Lake city. So I definitely want to attend this. I think
[46:41] it will be the perfect timing, October 9th through 11th. Um, it will be the perfect timing
[46:45] for, uh, dash platform. And, uh, yeah, there's going to be a lot of people here with lots
[46:54] of money, uh, to say the least, and lots of influence in the, in the cryptos, uh, scene.
[47:01] So yeah, I want to attend that. So that's another thing that I plan to do this quarter
[47:06] as well. Let's see, where are we? Did we ever get ash coming in? Nope, no ash. Um, we've
[47:14] got McHale's done. Um, anything, this is just a brief overview summary of our, um, of our
[47:24] budgets. So the three 50, 200, 400 and 400 requests that we have for each of our strategists
[47:32] here, this is our reserves. This is how much we intend to, um, to spend this quarter. And
[47:38] so, uh, that calculates out to these buffers. So if we're continuing to get, if we continue
[47:46] to get funding, uh, each of the proposals passed, then these will be our, um, our months
[47:52] of, uh, runway. And for each, for each month, this would be the runway if we didn't have
[47:59] funding. So we're all basically teetering on the edge of, um, zero, uh, as I've already
[48:08] talked about, that's it. Uh, that's it for me. Uh, let's see. Anybody else have anything
[48:15] to add there before we wrap up? Let's, uh, did you address the questions in the chat
[48:21] or two things? I haven't been seeing them, so let's, let's bring them up. Let's see.
[48:27] I'm a little behind, but was there any update on WalletConnect? Um, WalletConnect, I think
[48:32] that was you, Mikhail. Um, is that right? Um, I think it's related to xDefi, um, because,
[48:41] or no, it's not related to xDefi. I think, I think it's about, uh, Ash's project, uh,
[48:48] which is the wallet extension, which he put in his proposal. I don't think that that's,
[48:56] those are, those are different. So WalletConnect is, is a, I don't know if they call it.
[49:03] Ah, yeah, yeah. So basically, yeah, I remember this. Uh, sure. We got with the developers
[49:09] of the WalletConnect, but, um, but yeah, that's something that no one really did before. And,
[49:19] um, well, it's kind of difficult because I personally haven't used WalletConnect personally.
[49:26] Uh, I have like a review, like how it's working. Um, yeah. So we got with the developers, they
[49:36] said like, it should be possible, but nobody exactly knows where we should put the implementation
[49:44] and how to make this done. Yeah. So yeah, I was just reviewing my last communications
[49:51] with the WalletConnect guys and, um, they were, they were moving into, so as mentioned
[50:00] above, took his first stab at the address profile for the, there, there was some new
[50:06] version that they were, that they were trying to get out before they had any bandwidth to
[50:12] do any kind of third party help. Um, and, uh, this was, this was, um, this last update
[50:20] was from June. No, how are these? Let's see. I got to figure out what address format this
[50:30] is using. Yeah. June, June. So I'll, I'll reach back to these guys. Um, yeah. So basically
[50:40] the UTXO chains, the support of UTXO chains in the WalletConnect, that's something that
[50:45] the people really would like to see, but, uh, that's something that must be done. And
[50:51] okay. Um, well, because, uh, the digital cash network, which is Joelle, uh, asked this question,
[50:58] I just, um, bumped up our discord conversation to see if there's any traction. Yeah, there
[51:04] is, there is actually a Telegram group where, Oh, okay. Yeah. I think people, some people
[51:09] have moved to Telegram as well. So we'll look into that. Um, thanks for the reminder. Um,
[51:14] and then the other one, the other question, you want to bring that up? Uh, are the funds
[51:21] for Ash's proposal going towards the continuing development of Dashband? Let's look at Ash's
[51:25] proposal. Cause I don't think we've done that yet. Uh, he's not here, but we do have his
[51:30] proposal. So let's, let's bring it up. Okay. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[51:46] Wait a minute. This is 23. Sorry. Sorry, everybody. This is, uh, I mentioned this, but he hasn't
[51:53] requested funds since Q3 of 2023 and they had the wrong link up. So here's the next,
[51:59] here's the, uh, active proposal, two projects, dash pay extension wallet, and the explore
[52:13] dash web plus mobile and explore dash web. I'm pretty sure this is CTX, uh, spend dash
[52:27] spend as well. So I'll just, I'll just pan through the proposal texts and we're not going
[52:32] to read the whole thing, but here is the proposal itself. So did anybody see, let's just, uh,
[52:47] let's just look at this. Uh, the goal, the, the explore dash web plus mobile. The goal
[52:55] of this is to take the mobile wallet, explore dash experience, uh, to discover dash merchants
[53:03] direct accepting and gift cards. So yes, that is dash spend the part of the trouble with
[53:09] all of this is that the names keep getting changed. So, um, but I believe when he says
[53:16] directly accepting merchants and gift card merchants, I'm sure that that's going to include
[53:21] the dash spend merchants that he's working on as well and ATMs to be available on the
[53:26] web and extended with some more functionality around third-party gift card providers, CTX,
[53:31] which is dash spend, uh, bit refill coins, B coin cards, or else want to extend this
[53:38] directory to utilize platform as a source of truth for multiple front ends deployments
[53:43] wherever the state is useful. Okay. So, um, I'm getting replies from the, from the wallet
[53:53] connect people. Um, so we'll, we'll talk about that in a different show, I guess, but it
[53:59] looks like they're, they're on it. Okay. I'll go ahead and remove the screen share. Now.
[54:10] Okay. Anything, any, uh, parting words, Mikhail or Jojo bites. It looks like we didn't get
[54:15] ash in here at the end of the day, but, um, yeah, anything else to say? Uh, well, I don't
[54:24] know. We just continue, uh, continue building, continue doing stuff in the incubator. Um,
[54:32] from my side, I'm still growing my team, growing amount of projects that we have. So let's
[54:40] keep it going. Yeah, it's a, it's going to be a very exciting quarter. So, um, yeah,
[54:48] we have that to look forward to and, um, a lot of potential here. So looking forward
[54:54] to all of that, anybody, uh, yeah. So I think we've answered all the questions that came
[54:59] through the chat. Uh, so with that, we have a couple different streams that we're going
[55:05] to be, uh, streaming on this channel later today. So tune in for that. And, uh, aside
[55:11] from that, we'll say, see you next time. See you.
