Binance's decision to delist privacy-focused crypto networks and the transition to decentralized exchanges.

tl;dr: Binance, the largest crypto exchange, recently announced plans to delist several privacy-focused crypto networks for EU customers, but later revised the list from 12 to 5 networks. This move aligns with new EU legislation targeting privacy and is seen as an attempt by Binance to appease regulators. However, the rise of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) offers an alternative that prioritizes user control and privacy. The delisting controversy highlights the ongoing trend away from centralized power and towards decentralization in the crypto space.

---

[00:00] A few weeks ago, Binance announced their intention to delist multiple crypto networks to disallow customers in the European Union from transacting in them at all.
[00:12] This is big news in the crypto community as Binance is the largest crypto exchange or sex in the world.
[00:17] Getting delisted would mean one fewer way for prospective users to access a particular crypto network.
[00:22] The dozen crypto networks identified include some that are privacy by default, such as Monero and Beam, and some that are privacy-focused, such as Dash and Zcash.
[00:30] The complete list also included Decred, Horizon, PIVX, Navcoin, Secret, FIRO, Mobilecoin, and Verge.
[00:37] While many commenters put forth Binance's preliminary list as a done deal, it wasn't. Chalk that up to internet sensationalism.
[00:43] The date of implementation was slated for weeks out, June 26th, and before that date was reached, individuals involved with at least a few of the named networks proactively
[00:51] reached out to Binance to make their case against being delisted. Binance then released a revised list of networks to be delisted, which went from a dozen to
[00:58] five. Much rejoicing was had by community members in those networks that initially had been
[01:04] named but were ultimately not delisted. So yes, kudos is warranted.
[01:09] The five delisted networks are Beam, which claims uncompromising privacy through the use of Lelantis and MemoWimble, Monero, perhaps the most well-known privacy coin, which uses
[01:17] stealth addresses, ring signatures, and ring confidential transactions, Mobilecoin, which you may know of for its partnership with Signal, which strives for computational indistinguishability
[01:27] using zero-knowledge proofs, Fero, the new incarnation of Zcoin, which uses a stepped-up zero-knowledge proof scheme, Lelantis, and Horizon, which relies on ZK-SNARKs and has
[01:36] a treasury and an incentivized multi-tiered node structure. In short, though they differ in their implementation, these five networks prioritize privacy.
[01:45] Binance has faced criticism for its actions, denying the "right to privacy," but Binance, a huge company, is just trying to appease regulators, not support some esoteric claim.
[01:54] With new legislation in the European Union that targets privacy, Binance is getting into lockstep.
[01:59] Because Binance has faced pushback and outright prohibitions by regulators in several nation states for giving people options and money, it makes sense that these regulators want
[02:07] to curtail competition in currency. After all, they want to stay relevant.
[02:11] And it makes sense that these regulators decry privacy, not for themselves, mind you, but for those they claim to oversee, because it makes it easier to surveil and to govern.
[02:19] As Pierre-Joseph Perdon so astutely wrote almost two centuries ago, "to be governed is to be watched over, inspected, spied upon, directed, legislated for, regulated, penned
[02:27] up, indoctrinated, preached at, monitored, assessed, censored, and commanded by beings who boast neither the entitlement, the expertise, or the virtue."
[02:36] So where does this leave us? When choice and information has said to be prohibited within a certain political jurisdiction,
[02:42] there are always those who choose not to obey. Free people operate in the parallel economy, vote with their feet, and now, in the digital
[02:48] age, use VPNs to circumvent online censorship to access and share information. But Binance, in their attempt to remain friendly with regulators, actively works to prevent
[02:56] this. In fact, they claim to employ 750 experts to comply with regulators and to thwart those
[03:02] using VPNs. Again, Binance is a centralized, permissioned exchange.
[03:06] As such, they align operations according to the whims of regulators. They demand your information, they set limits, and they control your funds.
[03:13] An alternative is a decentralized exchange, or DEX. Early versions include Bancor and BISC.
[03:18] More well-known are Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and SushiSwap. In this realm, too, are decentralized protocols such as Maya and Thorshade, which are not
[03:25] constrained to a certain network or to wrapped tokens, but enable interchain operability. The commonality with all these DEXs is that you control your private keys, and you don't
[03:33] need to provide information to anyone. Historically, DEXs haven't been as straightforward to use as CEXs.
[03:38] As happens with any new technology, the first adopters are willing to put up with less-than-slick interfaces.
[03:43] Part of the main critique about DEXs is around liquidity, or lack thereof, but with each regulatory-inspired move making CEXs less and less relevant, demand for DEXs grows,
[03:52] and they are becoming better in usability, in liquidity, and in scale. This is evident by ShapeShift transitioning from a centralized to decentralized model
[04:00] to use classical mechanics for a visualization. The regulators are at the center of this model.
[04:05] The CEXs of the world, though perhaps more innovative than bureaucracies, are still intrinsically tied to that center.
[04:10] They orbit around it, a la centripetal force. Decentralized operations, including decentralized crypto-networks and exchanges, are more akin
[04:17] to centrifugal force, a movement away from the center. And to be more specific, centrifugal force is actually said to be a "false" force.
[04:25] That is, it is inertia moving away from the center. Once the attachment is no more, it is free.
[04:30] And that's analogous to what we're building today. We are not using force, we are not revolving around a center of arbitrary authority, we
[04:37] are cutting the mental and technological ties from that center that relies on surveillance and on coercion, and we are evolving to something better.
[04:44] The recent conversation about what networks finance is delisting is but a blip on humanity's timeline, one that is today moving away from centralization and toward decentralization.
[04:54] From centralized power to decentralized power. From few choices to many choices.
[04:59] This is why we build. Hello everyone, welcome to Incubator Weekly, we're happy to see you.
[05:12] Good morning Ryan and Tim, how are you fellas today? Good morning.
[05:19] I just love those intros, I love the work that Pete's doing on those. It inspires me every week, and I just wanted to say thank you for putting those together.
[05:34] It's not something that I have any control over at this point. I just, I kind of got this started and it's only gotten better since Pete has taken over
[05:43] on that. This particular week with the Binance story is interesting, and privacy, I think privacy
[05:54] is so so important, and I think Amanda, didn't we have some kind of an update on the Binance story itself?
[06:03] It appears so, all that can be told as of a couple few hours ago is that Binance has basically said actually we're not going to do any delistings as of now.
[06:19] So whether that means that they have a different plan going forward, or perhaps this is a sort of kicking a can down the road, or even maybe they've discovered that they have more influence
[06:32] and maybe more muscle than they originally thought, and they think that they can actually weather any sort of onslaught that might come of their saying no thanks, we're just going
[06:43] to keep everything as we had it. Wow.
[06:46] Well, that's great news as far as I'm concerned. I don't really, my opinion on DEXs is that they're kind of a, or not DEXs, but sexes
[06:59] like the intro said, I think that they're a dying breed, it might take 10 years, it might take 20 years, but I'm hoping, I don't know, this is just my vision, my hope, that
[07:13] we won't need conversion back into US dollars, for example, in 10 or 20 years, and that decentralized cryptocurrencies will be accepted as a valid medium of exchange, and that's really the
[07:29] only reason that we have these centralized exchanges at this point, is conversion back into fiat currency, because the DEXs do this seamless exchanges to other cryptocurrencies,
[07:46] that's really all we need in the future world. So whether Binance gets on board or not, it doesn't, I mean, it doesn't really matter
[07:54] to me, it's an interesting story, but it is kind of nice to see that those that are privacy focused are, like, they're taking a stand for privacy, for whatever reason they are.
[08:08] So that's nice. >> So Tim, you are joining us today to tell us a bit about the gold challenge platform,
[08:22] and that is something that has been kind of off and on in development for some time, is that right?
[08:27] >> Yeah, it's been, it has unfortunately suffered from the comings and goings of various developers, as happens, and unfortunately at the moment, we don't have any visuals to share because
[08:43] of that, because the account that it's hosted on is down for the moment, but we'll get that spun back up this next week, so we can continue the development on it.
[08:50] The biggest piece that we were waiting on was some of the finalization of being able to create a wallet through API and then be able to log in via platform onto it.
[09:02] Other than that, the development of the core product is complete, which is one of the exciting ones that, like I said, we've been playing with this one for about two years now, and
[09:14] it is a platform that is designed to allow you to bet on yourself. So one of the fundamental initial use cases was duplicating basically what the step bet
[09:32] challenge out there is, so if you can walk 10,000 steps a day for a week, and I'll bet a dash that I can do that, and if I can find a group of friends to also say, hey, we're
[09:44] all going to walk 10,000 steps a day, and at the end of the week, if you don't walk that 10,000 steps, then you lose your dash, and then everybody that did splits up the
[09:57] entire pot. And so it's a way of motivating yourself to complete challenges, to better yourself.
[10:05] You can, like, as soon as you start to think about it, you can see that the sky's the limit as far as what you can bet on, and then using the -- especially using the Internet of Things
[10:15] and using various APIs, you can begin to say, well, let's just automate that and make it so that I don't actually have to record how many steps I did, but I can log that through
[10:26] my Fitbit or log that through my Garmin watch or something like that to come in, and then using smart contracts, eventually be able to just make the whole process as seamless.
[10:37] So I just -- I log in, I connect what needs to be connected, and then I connect my wallet, and then I can join all the various challenges and then increase the network of people using
[10:49] Dash, and it also gives a really organic way for introducing new folks into the ecosystem, because it becomes much easier at that point, hey, join me on this challenge.
[10:59] We're going to read a book. We're part of a book club.
[11:01] Let's everybody join the book club, or we're part of a running or a cycling group. Let's everybody join that and be able to link whatever it is that you're using to track
[11:10] your mileage or track your activity. And does the app allow -- is it all like self-reported?
[11:19] Right now, yeah, the minimum, the MVP of it is all self-reported. Getting into -- we wanted to just get this piece built and like rely on a little bit
[11:30] of trust and community trust and understanding that if you're lying about your challenge that you bet on yourself, then -- You got bigger problems.
[11:41] Probably some work to do that you have, and maybe that should be the next challenge is to not lie about whether I accomplished how many steps I took.
[11:48] I think that's a good approach. I think something like this is the main purpose is more like it's just a fun thing that you
[11:56] do with friends, and it's more like we don't need this fully trustless system that's going to guarantee the payments.
[12:05] Automating the payments is nice, because it makes the fun part even less financial. So I kind of like that approach.
[12:14] I mean, you can put like the automation is good, because nobody really wants to deal with like, "Oh, okay, I'm going to -- I don't know, I'm going to transfer you."
[12:26] I guess there are things like Zelle that make that easier now with the traditional banking system.
[12:32] But if it's just like a push button, "Okay, now I didn't accomplish the goal," and it just sends out the little bonus stash to all the other people in your group, I think that's
[12:45] -- Exactly, because I've participated in various forms of these over the years, and they always
[12:53] eventually implode on themselves because of the effort of whoever it is, of whoever took on the organizing of it, to make sure that money gets collected at the beginning of whatever
[13:02] the bet or the challenge is, and the money gets distributed at the end, and then everybody checks in, and this, making it a platform, putting it -- making it a digital platform,
[13:12] which one, then broadens the horizon of who gets to join, but then also takes a lot of that work off, so that if I want to organize doing push-ups every day, then all I need
[13:24] to do is organize the doing the push-ups part. I don't need to make sure to collect money from everybody, and I don't need to make sure
[13:32] that I record that everybody did their 50 push-ups that day, or something like that, and then send that out, but the platform can actually handle that piece of it based on
[13:43] everybody's individual inputs. Yes.
[13:45] I think, going along with that, one of the things that comes to mind right now immediately is, well, how many of my immediate friends in the real world actually own any Dash, and
[13:58] so that might be the trickiest part is having them own some Dash, so what do we do about that?
[14:06] Like -- So --
[14:08] Do we give them some Dash so that they can bet on themselves, or -- I --
[14:13] Sell it to them anyway. I've -- right?
[14:15] I've thought -- I've thought about that, and one of the -- so that actually links to one of the other projects that's going on is the local Dash, which is a riff on the local Bitcoin
[14:27] that went down so many months ago, so that you can make it easy to just trade Dash for fiat or for something else that somebody else might own, and go ahead and just drop it right
[14:39] into that wallet that's going to be used for this. That would be a linking of a couple of pieces that are in the incubator ecosystem that are
[14:48] in finalization stages. And then -- so I can definitely see the -- you know, if I'm doing one of these challenges
[14:57] with people I know and trust, yeah, it makes total sense that we're all just self-reporting, because if we're lying to each other, we have a lot bigger problems in life.
[15:08] For like an expanded functionality, would this same app potentially be able to support I guess -- I mean, I guess it would be the use of oracles, right?
[15:18] Like if I say I want to bet on the outcome of the Super Bowl with people I don't know and don't trust?
[15:24] >> Yeah, it could be used for that. The vision for it isn't something like that.
[15:32] The vision for it is more along the lines of your own goals and challenges. But that goes back to like using the Internet of Things, and if you can set up oracles that
[15:41] are reading off of your Fitbit API, or that are reading off of your Strava API that can say you did accomplish these many miles and you did accomplish these many steps, I mean,
[15:52] at the end of the day, that's kind of that long-term -- that long-term bit. And you know, there's always going to be challenges that are very real world that you can just
[16:06] lie and say that you accomplished it. At the same time, the whole point isn't to make money off of it.
[16:12] So if I don't complete the challenge, I'm not really stealing from you, because your purpose behind putting the dash in isn't to win my dash, but to actually incentivize yourself
[16:28] to not lose that dash by actually accomplishing what you said you wanted to. >> I was just going to ask, what's the story for those of us who have no friends?
[16:40] >> Can we use this -- >> You can use this to find friends. >> No, I was actually thinking more like, is there a solo version of this where you
[16:50] just put up the dash, and then maybe you can pledge it to some kind of charity, or you could burn it, or whatever, instead of it going to a group of friends, it just goes
[17:01] out of your wallet, because you didn't do those pushups every morning. Something like that.
[17:07] I don't know. Something like that, where you throw the dash into a certain place, and then you really
[17:15] can't get it back. You throw it to a place, and you have to press -- I don't know.
[17:21] I don't know exactly what the user experience is, but you have to press the button that says I did this or I didn't do it.
[17:26] So there's still that honesty aspect of it, but at least you kind of have to tell yourself an explicit lie in order to try to get that dash back.
[17:36] Something like that. Is there a solo version of this?
[17:40] There is. So you can set up a challenge just for yourself, and not make it public, keep it private, make
[17:45] it just your own thing. And as part of it, you define what is the receiving address for the proceeds from the
[17:57] bet. And so when you join the challenge, you actually send the dash into an escrow address that
[18:05] then the platform will then distribute from. And so if you make your recipient address a nonprofit or charity that accepts dash,
[18:17] or you can just send it to a burn wallet, or you can send it to Ryan Gull. I know a lot of YouTubers that I would love to donate to, but I just don't get around
[18:29] to it, or I don't -- you know, there are various reasons. But this might be one of those things where you could have a list of freedom-loving activists,
[18:41] for example, that love to accept your dash if you don't complete your challenge. So I like this idea.
[18:49] It's kind of a bummer that we don't have something to show right now. Tell us again, we have the code base, but for some reason, the developer just hasn't
[18:58] got back with us, and the hosted version went down or something. So can we have some other developer pick this up and just deploy it?
[19:08] Because I'm assuming -- I think it was a Netlify link that I saw, and that's just really easy for anybody that has the code base and a Netlify account.
[19:18] They could just push it up to their account, and bam, it's deployed again. So maybe we can get that going soon.
[19:24] >> Yeah, we have both the Heroku -- the Heroku account is the one that is down. The Netlify account is incomplete, and so you can't get beyond the login screen.
[19:34] >> Gotcha. All right, well, anything else to say about this particular bounty, then, or this particular
[19:42] project? Do you need --
[19:45] >> Nothing else in particular. >> Do you -- anybody that's listening, if they think this idea is interesting, one of
[19:53] the challenges of incubator work is you have these -- you know, we don't have contracts, we don't have employment agreements with anybody.
[20:01] It's just, you know, you kind of show up, you do work if you want to, and then a lot of times people lose motivation or interest, and, you know, that's why we have people like
[20:12] us that kind of pick up the pieces and put new developers on it when that happens. So if you're a developer and you think this is an interesting idea, do you have any idea
[20:21] of what the -- what this was written in as far as technology stack goes? >> It is node.js.
[20:30] >> Okay. >> So I think this does -- but I think this does point to, one, we're always in need of
[20:39] developers. There's -- there's more ideas than we have -- than we have minds and keyboards to throw
[20:46] at them, and you don't have to program or write for the blockchain. You can -- this is --
[20:54] >> Most of it is traditional. >> Yeah.
[20:57] The state that we're at right now is a traditional web app. So it's written in node.js, but it doesn't have to be -- that happens to be because the
[21:05] development team that we had working on it, that was what they wanted to work in, and so that's what they worked in.
[21:12] We didn't come up with a requirement that it must be a node.js. So we don't typically have, well, this must be written in Ruby, or this must be written
[21:20] in PHP, or this must be written using whatever framework. It is whatever framework you want to be able to use, as long as it's a compatible framework
[21:28] that can be deployed across the internet. >> Okay.
[21:33] Well, I hope to -- I hope that that sort of call yields an interested individual. And aside from this, the -- what we're going to wrap up the show with today, since we have
[21:48] not one, but two current Incubator strategists with us, is to give a heads up on the change that we mentioned on our Twitter account last week, the change that's coming to how Incubator
[22:04] makes funding proposals to the Dash network going forward. We thought it would be a good idea to give you a bit of a heads up now, so that when
[22:13] the change happens, it's not a surprise, particularly if -- it may be that the change is evident like a day or two before our next quarterly call, so this will be sure to have us all
[22:26] on the same page. So Ryan, would you care to kick us off on this?
[22:31] >> Yeah, so we have the three Incubator strategists right now, Tim, myself, and Ash, and next quarter, we have our quarterly proposal coming up, and I think we're going to do our quarterly
[22:45] report in two weeks from now. Next week, we're going to be talking about a privacy project that we're working on, hopefully.
[22:55] I think that -- yes, I have confirmed that that's happening. It's a developer that I know well, and so definitely not going to drop out unannounced.
[23:09] So yeah, we'll be talking about privacy next week, and then our quarterly proposal -- our quarterly report the week after that, but before we get to that point, that's two weeks
[23:20] away, and we will have submitted our proposal before that. So the heads-up here is that we're going to be -- you're going to see three proposals
[23:31] from the Incubator, one from myself, one from Tim, and one from Ash, and we'll all be requesting different amounts based on the projects that we have personally.
[23:45] And so this is -- this will be explained a little bit more in detail. It will also be accompanied by a rule change in the Incubator that kind of specifies what
[23:56] this is all about, but yeah, I wanted to kind of bring -- you know, we have these three strategists, and they currently submit proposals to me, but I found that, you know, I don't
[24:12] want to be that bottleneck of saying -- or not bottleneck, but I don't want to be the person that's saying, no, you can't have this much, or as far as have this much from our
[24:26] general Incubator budget. I would rather have all the strategists going directly to the Masternode owners, and then
[24:35] that way, the Masternode owners have a little bit more fine-grained control over funding decisions.
[24:42] So -- >> And Ryan, is it -- do I understand rightly, when I was asking you a few questions about
[24:49] this recently, you said that this approach also allows people who may want to become strategists themselves to put in a proposal, just like you and Ash and Tim may, which is
[25:07] to say, here's my proposal for the work and projects that I want to oversee and network if you approve, I am agreeing to abide by all of the practices and standards established
[25:21] within the Incubator thus far. Is that right?
[25:23] Does that work? >> Yeah, exactly.
[25:25] So instead of me deciding, or we as a group deciding, let's bring on another Incubator strategist and have us be like the permission layer of that and saying, yes, we want to
[25:42] bring you on as a strategist, instead, anybody will just be able to put a proposal up and say, I want to join the Incubator as a strategist, meaning basically like a project manager,
[25:57] but it's more than that. You are responsible for --
[26:01] >> The funds. >> The fund.
[26:04] Well, actually, the first iteration will probably be that I will still be doing treasury roles, so I will be doing payouts, because I don't want that to be -- I don't want the network
[26:17] to say, to have to think about, oh, I don't trust so-and-so with funds. I want it to be more like the network can just continue trusting me, which, you know,
[26:31] that is a trust relationship, and that won't be the hurdle. So the hurdle will be, are they delivering projects that I find valuable, not, do I trust
[26:45] this person? Because --
[26:47] >> Okay. So the proposal request would go to an address that is known to be an Incubator payment address,
[26:54] so that the MNOs are voting on the person, but they know that the funds are still going toward an address that you have control of, Ryan, is that right?
[27:02] >> Exactly. So that will be the first step, because I want to do it with baby steps, like, I don't
[27:09] want too many variables commingling together in this decision. I want to make it a decision, like, do you trust -- do you find value in this strategist's
[27:21] projects? And also -- because there might be somebody that's new, right?
[27:28] There might be somebody that's, like, a new person on the Dash scene that wants to get -- wants to work for Dash, but doesn't have any reputation in Dash yet.
[27:40] >> Which we've seen can turn really ugly. >> Sorry.
[27:43] Say again? >> Oh, I just said, which we've seen can turn really ugly, like, when newcomers try to come
[27:49] and be like, hey, this is who I am, this is what I'm about. It can turn very ugly.
[27:53] >> It's kind of like a trust system, honestly, unfortunately. That's what it is.
[28:00] There are a few developers who are stepping up and then saying, I'm going to take on the risk of delivering before I even ask for funds.
[28:10] So Dash Money, I think, was his name. He's a great example of this.
[28:15] He just had a successfully funded proposal where he has three projects that are dealing with Dash platform and getting names and, like, a little shout-out project.
[28:30] And so he got funded by this. But I think that was because he just did a ton of work beforehand.
[28:37] There aren't many people that would be willing to do that. But that's another approach.
[28:43] So if you are a new person, and again, like, it's so important that we get new blood into Dash.
[28:51] But it's also so difficult. So that's the challenge here, is we have these two routes now.
[28:57] You can, if you're new and you want to get some funding to work on Dash, you have two routes.
[29:05] You have the, well, three routes, but one of them is not really viable. The one that's not viable is you just show up and you're a new person and you ask for
[29:14] a bunch of funds and people laugh you out of the room and they say, "We don't know who you are.
[29:19] We don't trust you that you'll deliver and you have no reputation here." So that's, like, that's not a viable option.
[29:26] And then the other option is you work your butt off and spend a bunch of time and money delivering something and then you just hope that the Dash network will pay you for it.
[29:39] And sometimes that works and sometimes that doesn't work. And if that doesn't work, then you really grow to hate the Dash project because you
[29:49] did a bunch of work and you actually didn't get compensated for it and there are hard feelings.
[29:55] So this is kind of like a third way to have the benefits of both of the other ways without the costs.
[30:06] So the benefit would be that you can work and you don't really have to have a reputation because somebody else, me in this case, is going to be controlling the funds and only
[30:20] paying out if there are deliverables. So you can do that, but you don't have to also put in a ton of work and not get compensated.
[30:32] So it is kind of like a middle ground. So that's the idea is that if you're a project manager and you think that you can add value
[30:39] to Dash, you don't have a reputation. You can come in, you can submit a proposal, say, for 100 Dash and say, "I want to be an
[30:45] incubator strategist and I want to work on X, Y and Z projects," or "I just want to have a budget to work with in the future and give me a shot with 100 Dash," then if your proposal
[30:59] is successful, then the funds go to me and then you just work as normally you would in the incubator.
[31:08] So basically the MNOs are hiring you at that point, "hiring" in quotes. And technically, this wouldn't actually require even any interaction with you prior, right,
[31:21] Ryan? Right.
[31:23] If I wanted to do this, I would just be sure that the payout address that I put on my proposal is the appropriate one and I wouldn't even necessarily have to talk to you first.
[31:31] Right. Yeah.
[31:33] So it's like a permissionless system. Well, not permissionless, but it's not me that you get permission from.
[31:42] It's the MNOs you get permission from. That's my goal with this, is to get more people interfacing directly with the masternode owners
[31:52] and not having, like, incubator could grow, right? We could ask for more funds.
[31:58] We could ask for 1200 Dash, 1500 Dash, and we could just start trying to ask for more. But that just makes us a big behemoth that, you know, I don't want.
[32:11] I don't like, I've said this many times, so it's not any secret. I don't like that Dash Core Group is so big.
[32:20] And so this is my approach to scaling, but without any single organization becoming a huge organization.
[32:30] Now, I have to also say that it would be nice and my goal and my desire would be that these independent people, me, Tim, Ash, and anybody in the future who become incubator strategists,
[32:47] my goal would be that that would be a temporary stepping block. And that at some point, once you've gained enough reputation, then you would graduate
[32:56] from the incubator and you would become your own thing. And then you would submit your proposal under a rebranded organization name.
[33:11] And then you would have your address and you could carry along with that your own rules. You could tweak the rules.
[33:20] You could keep the rules of the incubator, but now you're not an incubator project, you're your own thing.
[33:25] And so you've kind of graduated. And then that creates more healthy competition between the different organizations that are
[33:32] working for and competing to provide value for Dash. And that competition is what really will drive value because right now, there's just not
[33:43] a lot of competition. So basically anybody that can do anything can kind of get funding.
[33:50] And there's a big rabbit hole of discussion about whether that's good or not, but we won't get into that.
[33:55] But we definitely do need more people working for Dash, more people competing in Dash. And this is my attempt to do that.
[34:06] Okay. All right.
[34:10] So it sounds like we have a fairly good heads up of what to expect for the next two weeks. As we said, next Monday will be an update on some of the current privacy work going
[34:24] on in the incubator. And then the following week, which is July the 10th, we'll have not only Ryan and Tim,
[34:31] but also Ash join for the, I guess will be the final quarterly report with all three of them, you know, coming with the same report and the same effort before the proposals are
[34:46] made differently. So.
[34:48] I do think that we will continue this incubator weekly show as a group, because I do think that that cohesion is important to be part of a team still.
[34:58] But it's kind of like, you know, there's a little bit more competition. And again, the masternode owners have more discretion about who they fund and they don't
[35:09] have to defund the whole incubator or they have to fund the whole incubator as one package. They can kind of have a little bit more fine grained control.
[35:19] But I do like getting together and having these incubator weekly things. And I think that that will probably remain more or less unchanged.
[35:28] But again, once somebody is not part of the incubator and has rebranded and has their own organization that's continuing to work for Dash, then, you know, then it would make
[35:38] sense for them to not be part of the incubator weekly show. But until then, we'll probably continue as we've had in the past.
[35:48] And so, Tim, in the case that anyone is interested to take up this sort of empty post to take Goal Challenge platform forward, Pete, could we get Tim's Discord information brought up
[36:01] on the screen once more? So, to be clear, it was Node.js.
[36:06] And then is there anything else that people should know? >> At this point, no.
[36:16] The biggest thing is getting it rehosted. >> Rehosted.
[36:19] Great. All right.
[36:21] Well, everybody, we've been glad to see you. We'll be glad to see you next time.
[36:27] And until then, take care.
