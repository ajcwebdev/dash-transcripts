[00:00] (upbeat music) - Just to let you know where I stand
[00:15] right from the very top, for me, freedom means your right as an individual
[00:19] to be the person that God, or the universe, intended you to be.
[00:24] Beyond culture, beyond religious orthodoxy, beyond race, your right to be you,
[00:29] your right to your freedom. Not your right to tell other people what to do,
[00:32] from whatever perspective. And I believe in your freedom of expression,
[00:35] whether that's on the right or the left. As long as your freedom of expression
[00:38] doesn't involve oppressing others, I believe in your freedom.
[00:42] (upbeat music) - None of this is by accident.
[00:48] Pay attention. Today, collectively, World Central Banks
[00:50] are deliberately pushing the entire world financial system off of a cliff.
[00:55] Obviously, the people with it, and intentionally crushing the consumer,
[00:58] while at the same time, pushing the world ever closer to global war.
[01:01] The world's population today is in the middle of an intentionally created
[01:06] environment of rising inflation, a situation which in no way is gonna get any better,
[01:10] despite transitory, temporary, peaking, and freaking sticking.
[01:14] All right? And with that, the world economy itself
[01:17] is contracting at its fastest pace ever. (upbeat music)
[01:24] - Obviously, they're simply exploiting an opportunity to continue with their agenda as they have always done.
[01:30] I believe the issues that they're pretending to care about are important issues.
[01:35] And if these issues were correctly addressed, along with all inequality,
[01:38] most notably economic inequality, you would see real change in society.
[01:42] Real change in society means diminishing the potential for the powerful to continue
[01:48] to operate within systems that always prefer their desired outcomes.
[01:52] That change can never be allowed. The system will always happily make gestures.
[01:55] The system will always happily fund jamborees and galas that don't change anything
[02:00] and provide opportunities for Walmart. What we need is legitimate change,
[02:03] legitimate alliance, legitimate care and love that looks beyond identity and cares truly
[02:09] and authentically about all of our freedom. (upbeat music)
[02:14] - Do you feel like you have representation? Honestly, we have no representation anymore.
[02:19] Your votes don't count. We have no representation anymore.
[02:22] This whole thing has been taken over by a corrupt, twisted organization
[02:28] who's hell-bent on controlling the entire world. And we're talking about central banks collectively.
[02:33] Where's the outrage? Where's the uproar?
[02:35] People, remember what I'm telling you. You and me, we are the resistance.
[02:40] We raise our awareness. We get this stuff out there.
[02:42] We educate ourselves. We understand how the system works.
[02:45] We know who the players are. We can't lose, but we gotta get more people involved.
[02:49] The takeaway is this. Expect war to greatly expand.
[02:53] Expect the world's economy to contract much faster. Expect inflation to get a lot worse.
[02:59] Expect global debt to hyper-balloon. Expect job losses to skyrocket.
[03:04] And expect a major false flag event to occur with many people, maybe even some of you, maybe me,
[03:14] losing our lives just so they can get the general population to back another war.
[03:24] (upbeat music) So when people talk about the freedom is a dubious term,
[03:30] what they're attempting to do is prevent galvanization, prevent people coming together of all races,
[03:35] of all colors, with a wide range of interests, but all ultimately could sit within the framework
[03:39] of a popular movement where we all enjoy more freedom, where we all enjoy more access to resources,
[03:44] and more importantly, democracy. Sometimes life does involve suffering.
[03:47] Sometimes life does involve sacrifice. But what it needn't be about is increasing centralization,
[03:53] increasing institutional power, increasing surveillance and digital IDs,
[03:57] increasing bigotry and hatred of people of all hues and colors,
[04:00] turning people against one another in order to simply ensure that systems
[04:03] can continue to operate as they currently do for maximum profit and power without any concern
[04:08] for the impact it might have on you. (upbeat music)
[04:12] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[04:17] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[04:22] (upbeat music) - Hello, and welcome to Incubator Weekly.
[04:27] Today, I'm joined as always by Rion, and also our guest today is Dash developer, Jojo Byte.
[04:35] Jojo, how are you today? - I'm doing pretty well, thanks for asking.
[04:39] How are you guys? - Great.
[04:43] - I'm well also. Well, we are going to start today's episode
[04:49] with introducing Jojo Byte to you. We'll then move into a discussion
[04:55] for which he is uniquely suited to comment, and for which we hope to also receive your comments
[05:00] in the live chat, which is, what are the pros and cons of working pseudonymously?
[05:06] And then finally, we are going to show you a Incubator funded project that Jojo has been working on,
[05:16] which is an alternative interface for staking via Crowdnode,
[05:21] one which enhances privacy, I'm told. So we'll get to all that later.
[05:25] So to start, Jojo, please, will you tell us a bit about, I don't know, I guess about your professional background
[05:33] as a software developer? - Sure, I've been developing websites
[05:39] for a long time, I think near 20 years now. And I guess I've done a little,
[05:48] well, I used to do a lot of PHP, but mostly now I do a lot of JavaScript,
[05:54] both on the server and front-end. And I've done some React projects, I've done Vue.
[06:02] Yeah, I've bounced around front-end frameworks and all sorts of stuff like that.
[06:07] And now I've been doing a lot of vanilla JS type of projects where I'm hand-coding everything
[06:15] and not basing it on any frameworks, so yeah. - Okay, well, I'm sure to a lot of people
[06:22] that made a lot of sense. Will you tell us then what,
[06:27] first of all, how did you even hear of Dash? And then how did you hear of the Incubator in particular?
[06:36] - I heard of Dash years ago, just being semi-interested in cryptocurrency.
[06:43] It was popular enough, I had heard of it, but I hadn't done much with it.
[06:47] And then through a bizarre course of interactions, I ended up meeting CoolAJ86,
[07:00] and he was on the show last week. And he has been involved with the Dash Incubator
[07:06] and kind of got me involved, so yeah. - Wow.
[07:11] - Although you met and knew him from a long time before last week.
[07:16] - Did I say last week? Yeah, he was on the show last week.
[07:20] - No, you said that, but I didn't know if it was clear to other people.
[07:24] It's clear to me, 'cause I've worked with you for several months now.
[07:28] And yeah, but you've gone back with AJ quite a lot longer than that, so yeah.
[07:37] - So you met AJ in person then, Jojo? - Yeah, many times now, so yes.
[07:43] - Okay, so this kind of segues to our discussion of today, which is what are the pros and cons?
[07:52] Why have you chosen to work pseudonymously? And then what cons do you feel
[07:58] have come about as a result of that? And this is an especially nuanced discussion
[08:03] because it sounds like, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you met AJ in person.
[08:07] - Correct. - Yeah, so that's wild.
[08:11] - And we've met in person as well. So he's kind of straddling the line, I guess,
[08:17] between pseudonymy and whatever the opposite of that is. - So start by telling us, why did you choose to,
[08:25] at least when it comes to worldwide web-based appearances, such as this and an incubator work and whatnot,
[08:31] why did you choose to be pseudonymous, Jojo? - Hmm, I suppose there's,
[08:39] it's really just that once you put something out on the internet, you have no guarantee
[08:46] you can ever get it back. And I think actually cryptocurrency
[08:51] got me started thinking about this. Like once you've put something there,
[08:57] like it could be on a blockchain and you have no guarantee of it ever being deleted.
[09:02] And so you kind of have to really think about, am I okay if this never goes away?
[09:09] And in the other sense, I mean, we're now in the AI era and it's like, well, there's deep fakes.
[09:17] The more stuff you're putting out there, people could deep fake you.
[09:20] It might not be good enough to fool people close to you, but maybe it could.
[09:26] You don't know how bad things will get and things seem to be getting worse in that regard.
[09:33] And yeah, so maintaining your privacy as best you can, that's what I'm trying to do.
[09:40] But I also think privacy is for, I mean, privacy is for everything,
[09:45] but especially what I'm putting out on the internet, like that's, I'm more careful with that
[09:52] than people I know in person, like I know them in person. They already know me, they know I exist.
[09:59] But as far as the internet, like I could be an AI right now. I could be typing this into a chat program, so.
[10:07] - I'm starting to wish that I hadn't gone public. Those are really compelling arguments, Jojo.
[10:16] - Thank you. - Too late now. - And to be fair, well, Jojo Bites got a voice, obviously,
[10:23] and I won't be the one to say if that's, so like his real voice or not.
[10:29] But if, so that's kind of straddling the line too, because I just feel like with the world going the way it is,
[10:37] you have, it's so difficult to remain private and anonymous or pseudonymous.
[10:46] If you can, if you've got your voice out there attached to your name, your real identity somewhere,
[10:54] you gotta believe that somewhere in some database, there's a record of this is this person's name,
[11:01] this is this person's voice. So I kind of like, that's one of the reasons why I'm not,
[11:07] and it's just one of the reasons, but I just feel like they're,
[11:12] the people that I care to be private from, they're going to find out whether,
[11:19] no matter what I do, pretty much. So I'd rather just be upfront with it and say,
[11:23] here I am, this is what I do, and just let the consequence follow that,
[11:31] and whatever those consequences may be. But one of the reasons why I wanted to talk about this
[11:36] was it's becoming increasingly scary, I guess you could say, for lack of a better term.
[11:43] You've got the developer of Tornado Cache rotting in a jail cell right now for no reason
[11:52] other than he wrote some code. And I don't know the particulars of that case,
[11:57] but that's definitely one reason to try to keep your privacy.
[12:02] And I know that there are a lot of developers in Dash that are anonymous, pseudonymous,
[12:10] and I can't blame them for that. And it might be me that's naive thinking
[12:18] that everything's going to be just fine, and I can be out here with my real identity and not worry.
[12:26] I do worry about it a little bit, but on the other hand, I've just made the decision
[12:31] that I'm not doing anything wrong. In fact, I'm doing everything right
[12:36] as far as what I'm doing for a living, trying to move forward the cryptocurrency cause,
[12:42] because to me, it's the most important thing that we can be doing right now
[12:47] is fixing the world monetary system. The intro, some of you may have noticed,
[12:54] was a little more intense this week. That was by design and by choice.
[13:00] I think the stakes are very high in cryptocurrency, both on the pro side and on the con side.
[13:06] Like you could end up like that developer of Tornado Cache just for developing something that gives people privacy.
[13:15] You could end up in a jail right now. On the other hand, you could be a total hero,
[13:22] and you are a total hero if you can further this cause, because the stakes are high on the opposite end too.
[13:30] Like we're witnessing in our lifetime a major crackdown on human rights,
[13:37] and that's unacceptable to me. And that's why we kind of have this intro section
[13:42] about why we build. It's a little bit personal for me.
[13:45] Granted, like I curate these clips every week for the past three weeks so far.
[13:50] And so I'm choosing what inspires me and motivates me, but I'm also open to having other people
[13:58] share clips that they find that are the reasons that they're building.
[14:03] It might be anything from, I just find this to be fun. You know, I like developing,
[14:08] and it's not a big thing for me. Like I'm not trying to save the world,
[14:12] but I just think it's fun, and it's really interesting tech.
[14:15] That's great. But for me, it's something much bigger.
[14:18] - And I guess there's maybe room to discuss a third option here
[14:24] between the pseudonymity versus public facing, which is the ability to have different identities,
[14:32] so to speak, online, different profiles, which is to say that, you know,
[14:36] hey, if I see an advantage for myself because, you know, I have a nice beard,
[14:41] I have nice hair and nice manly, you know, baritone voice. - Are you describing me?
[14:47] I'm just kidding. - And I can, you know, command a certain amount of attention
[14:53] or benefit via having that profile. Well, there is no preventing one
[15:00] from at the same time having, you know, a coding profile that, like JoJo's, is pseudonymous,
[15:08] that, you know, does stuff that the public face does not do.
[15:12] I mean, how feasible an option is that? - Well, I'm sure JoJo might have something to say to this,
[15:20] but I'll jump in real quick. There's a pretty good chance
[15:24] that I have maybe interacted with and even paid out some bounties to AIs for all I know.
[15:31] There's one in particular that I'm fairly convinced that it's an AI, or not fairly convinced,
[15:39] but I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be. And, you know, the work was somewhat questionable,
[15:46] but it was also somewhat valuable. So it doesn't really matter in terms of, you know,
[15:52] I don't need to know your identity to see if you're producing valuable work.
[15:56] But on the other hand, I just, you're not, I'm going to be leaning more towards funding
[16:08] and interacting with and spending time with to get to know real people that I know are real people
[16:15] and that are, you know, showing their true identity. That's just me personally.
[16:22] It's with the upcoming AI thing, it's going to be a little crazy.
[16:28] You might be spending a lot of time just dealing with random code, and that's scary to me.
[16:38] I don't know exactly why, but sometimes it can be a waste of time.
[16:44] So, but if I know that I can sit across the table from someone, like Jojobight,
[16:48] I have sat across the table from him, that makes me feel like, okay,
[16:53] that's, there's more potential here. - Yeah.
[16:58] Well, I, this is probably, you know, an appropriate time for me to say
[17:03] that completely coincidentally, my husband and I were planning to return later this year
[17:13] to spend most of our time in an area that is not that far from Rion.
[17:20] And I guess from the sounds of it, probably not that far from Jojobight or AJ.
[17:25] And so that's something that I really look forward to as well, Rion, which is just sitting across the table,
[17:30] the table from people who I, with whom I can speak. And, you know, in the case of Jojo,
[17:36] sitting across the table with someone, you know, like, "Hey, it was great talking to you online."
[17:40] And, "Oh, how much better to meet you in person now." Because as much work as we can accomplish online,
[17:47] and as we all have accomplished online together over the years, I don't know if I speak for many others
[17:54] when I say this, but shoot, you know, sometimes staring at a screen gets a little lonely
[17:59] and how nice would it be to, you know, sit down and share a meal or, you know,
[18:03] have drinks or coffee or whatever. And so that's something that I really look forward to
[18:08] and hope that within the DASH community, we can have more of in the future.
[18:12] You know, whether it's little hubs, just here and there, here and there.
[18:15] In this case, we're talking about the Northern Utah area or, you know, what have you, because I see the,
[18:24] as you've mentioned, Jojo and Rion, there's benefit to both. There's benefit to the online pseudonymous stuff,
[18:30] hell, to even paying out AIs for work contributed. And then there's also value to, you know,
[18:36] meeting up for a drink, shaking hands, and enjoying each other's company that way.
[18:41] - Yeah, and I think that's how adoption grows anyway. Your local scene is where to concentrate, personally.
[18:49] - Well, if we don't have any additional comments from the viewers on that topic,
[18:57] I think that now would be the perfect time for us to shift to today's software demo.
[19:04] And so to start out, I know you had mentioned, Rion, that we wanna make sure we have
[19:09] some common understanding of terms. But before we even move into our common understanding
[19:16] of terms, I wanna say first, I know that I myself don't understand the A/B contrast
[19:24] between what you're gonna show us today, Jojo, and what is currently the option.
[19:29] So Jojo, will you explain to us what is the current setup that crowdnode.io
[19:37] has going on for people who want to log on and stake any amount of Dash, you know, starting at one Dash,
[19:44] and why is it that it can be improved upon from a privacy standpoint?
[19:48] - Sure. Currently, at least as far as I'm aware,
[19:53] you have to provide an email address to sign up. And then I believe you might have to verify
[20:00] some sort of other identifying factors to be able to deposit into,
[20:08] well, I think you can deposit there, but you can't stake the money you deposit there
[20:14] until you've kind of identified yourself and verified you're a real person.
[20:20] - Actually, that's not the case. Crowdnode is a fairly private platform as it is,
[20:30] but you do have to provide an email address and a password. And I think that their authentication system,
[20:39] actually, the person who got this project started in the first place was coolage86.
[20:45] And I think I remember him saying something to the effect that the authentication system uses
[20:54] some kind of large company behind it. And that was part of the motivation.
[20:59] But another part of the motivation was, you know, Crowdnode puts out an API for a reason.
[21:06] And that reason is they want other people to be able to interact with their service,
[21:12] other applications to interact with your service. There's no other reason to put out an API.
[21:16] So we wanted to also have an implementation or a reference application for using that API.
[21:26] So we made an SDK first, which is an SDK, yeah, software development kit,
[21:34] is basically just a package of code that you import into your code and use those functions.
[21:42] And it makes it a lot easier to use those functions. And then you can put on top of that,
[21:49] you can use those functions in different interfaces. So the first interface that we did
[21:54] was a command line interface, which AJ did. And now we are putting a user interface on it,
[22:03] a graphical user interface on it, which is what Jojobyte has been working on.
[22:08] So rounding that all out, this is essentially a reference application
[22:16] to using both Crowdnode's native API and our incubator SDK for Crowdnode.
[22:25] And just so everybody's clear, we're not part of the Crowdnode team,
[22:29] we're the incubator, the Dash incubator, but we want to support that project.
[22:33] It's the project that I find has the most, has the best product market fit
[22:40] that I've seen in cryptocurrency. People want to save right now
[22:44] and they want to get a yield on their savings. And they're not finding that in fiat currencies,
[22:52] national currencies and cryptocurrencies. That's one of the biggest use cases right now
[22:57] is just saving and earning a yield on your savings. And we can't reject that.
[23:03] Like as much as we want Dash to be used in payments and day-to-day transactions,
[23:11] the reality is most people want to just save and earn both a yield and appreciation on their Dash.
[23:20] So we want to help serve that use case. - Okay, so I think I'm probably going to get a better idea
[23:26] of what's on offer here if we just start the walkthrough. So Jojo, may I bring it up the screen share?
[23:34] - Yeah, sure. - So let's just take it away.
[23:39] And if I have, or if anyone else has a question, we'll just pop in.
[23:43] - All right. So right now this Crowdnode.js UI
[23:49] is implementing several other, it's implementing both the SDK Rion just mentioned,
[23:56] but also several other projects that Kool-Aid J86 has worked on
[24:00] to generate the recovery phrases and various private public key pairs,
[24:09] which that's Dash HD and several other things connected to it.
[24:14] And so this is the first screen you land on right now. And you're given the opportunity
[24:20] to either add a pre-existing recovery phrase or a WIF, which is a private key that is not as memorable
[24:30] but it still works with this, or you can generate a new one.
[24:33] So I'm going to go ahead and generate. - This WIF is wallet import format
[24:38] for anyone that's wondering. It's just the private key in a wallet import format.
[24:43] - And Jojo, when you say that we land on this page, does that mean that as a new user,
[24:48] we've just navigated to a specific URL and this is what we see or how do we land here?
[24:53] - Yes, it's not fully deployed yet, but when you go to the website
[24:57] that will be deployed very soon, you would land on something like this.
[25:02] So you'd get to the website and you'd see something like this
[25:06] if you have no wallets already saved, but which in this case, I have nothing saved yet.
[25:14] So I'm going to go ahead and generate a wallet and this will use the tooling that Coolio J86 has built
[25:21] to generate a new recovery phrase and a new public address. And I can now interact with this
[25:29] just like any other dash address or a wallet. And so one of the first things you kind of need to do
[25:37] is deposit some funds. And so I will go ahead and deposit.
[25:43] - We should make somebody else deposit. I'm just kidding.
[25:49] - Who hosts this web server and how is the cost covered? Rion, you want to answer that?
[25:58] - Well, right now it's just on local host, I believe, but we will be like incubator
[26:05] will cover the cost of hosting the URL when that comes. - And then let's go to a PME's question who says,
[26:17] can you back up a bit from where you all are and describe a bit about the structure of Dash?
[26:22] How are payouts to stakeholders possible? Is this common to all cryptocurrencies?
[26:26] Ooh, that's a big one. That's a real big one.
[26:28] - Payouts, let's put that question back up on the screen if you could, Pete.
[26:33] The structure of Dash is that Dash is a DAO, meaning that it's a decentralized autonomous organization.
[26:43] That's just the fancy term that we use for it now, but basically you can put proposals to the network
[26:50] that you want to receive some funding from the Dash Block reward.
[26:55] And if the Dash Block, if the stakeholders, which is in our case, the masternode owners,
[27:02] vote with sufficient voting that they want to pay you out, then you get paid from newly minted Dash
[27:09] from the Dash Blockchain once a month. And that's how Dash Incubator is funded.
[27:13] And then we further divvy that Dash up to different projects that we find value with,
[27:20] including this project. So that's like really quick zoom out
[27:24] and then zoom back into what we're doing. How are payouts to stakeholders possible?
[27:29] I think I might've answered that question. Is it common to all cryptocurrencies?
[27:34] Definitely not. Dash is one of the only cryptocurrencies that does this.
[27:38] In fact, it might be the only cryptocurrency that does something like this on the layer of blockchain,
[27:45] natively to the original blockchain. There are other, there are a ton of different DAOs
[27:52] in different ecosystems, Ethereum, whatnot, that have DAOs as tokens, token projects,
[28:00] outside of and on top of their layer one cryptocurrency blockchain, but-
[28:06] And so they're not able to use it to govern or incentivize any of the layer one-
[28:10] It's not Ethereum itself, yes. Yeah.
[28:14] Thank you for the question, Viola. Let us get back to where we were in our demo.
[28:21] Okay. Please pick it back up for us, Jojo.
[28:27] All right. Let's see here.
[28:30] So I just managed to fund the address. Oh, we missed the best part.
[28:38] That's okay. My apologies.
[28:42] I guess I could fund another one. How about I do that?
[28:45] Because I was going to add another one from the recovery phrase.
[28:49] So this should add another one. It has a zero balance.
[28:53] So I can come in here. Let's see.
[29:03] So if you do deposit, you can copy that address. (keyboard clicking)
[29:11] And in a moment here, it should close out. See.
[29:24] So that's sent. There we go.
[29:29] So it just funded. So now both of the wallets have funding in them.
[29:35] These are separate recovery phrases. So they are individual.
[29:40] If you go into staking, then you're able to interact with these funds.
[29:45] You need some funds in the wallet to be able to sign up for CrowdNode.
[29:52] So these are the same ones from the other wallet page. So staking and wallet are relatively similar
[29:58] just for different purposes. So I'm going to click sign up on the first one.
[30:04] And this, I just made this up. We might want to change the wording here,
[30:10] but you have to click accept. - And I accept the CrowdNode.
[30:14] - Yeah. And then this just takes a little while.
[30:20] So. - So you'll notice that there's no username,
[30:24] no email, no password, nothing like that in this. - So while the signup is taking place,
[30:31] let us check out TL's question. First of all, thanks.
[30:37] We're glad you think it's an awesome show. Secondly, he says interface looks great.
[30:41] What are your thoughts about using vanilla JS versus a framework like React or Vue?
[30:47] Let's start with that question. Oh, I'm sorry.
[30:49] I guess it's the same question. Is it to reduce dependencies?
[30:52] And what about longer developer time? - I'll give a first answer to that question
[30:56] because we decided this mutually, Jojo, Biden and me. But the reason that I wanted to do it this way
[31:03] is because I want to have a reference application that any JavaScript developer,
[31:10] well, should be able to look at and say, okay, I understand exactly how this works
[31:15] 'cause I understand JavaScript. If we had made the reference application in React,
[31:20] somebody like a Vue developer might look at it and be like, I don't know React.
[31:23] This doesn't help me. So we wanted to, in my opinion,
[31:27] Jojo Bight will object to this. But in my opinion, using vanilla JS
[31:34] is a little bit less efficient, but I wanted to do it this way for that reason
[31:39] so that any JavaScript developer can understand what's going on here.
[31:42] - I don't object to that, by the way. It is less efficient in many ways.
[31:48] - Yeah, it's like churning your own butter. - Yeah.
[31:52] - You can either go to the store and get the butter that professionals have put together in a nice, easy way,
[31:57] or you can churn your own butter and it might taste better and you understand exactly
[32:02] what the process was getting into it. But yeah, it's kind of the same idea.
[32:06] It takes a lot longer. But I think it was useful in this case.
[32:10] And just so everybody knows, the signup for Crowdnode, what it's actually doing
[32:14] is it's implementing the blockchain API that Crowdnode has, which uses on-chain-payments as the API.
[32:21] It's something that you'll probably very rarely see anywhere else.
[32:26] So instead of doing a REST API call and getting an API key and everything like that
[32:31] from Crowdnode, it's completely permissionless, it's completely private.
[32:35] All you have to do is send a certain amount of funds with the exact amount that the API requires,
[32:43] and that's what's doing the signup for you. And it's registering your address in their backend
[32:49] and saying, okay, whenever I receive funds from this address, now I know that that's going
[32:54] to this account. So that's what the signup is doing,
[32:57] and that's why you had to pay some DASH to do that. - Which is why it's showing here
[33:03] that there's this amount staked. It's not enough to actually start earning interest,
[33:09] but it used funds to basically trigger the signup process. - And so this is complete, this is all someone
[33:19] would have needed to have done to get started. - Yeah, this address is now signed up,
[33:24] this top one is not. So the bottom one is now signed up,
[33:28] and I can either send more funds or unstake the funds that are there.
[33:33] So I can go ahead and click this, and I've got, I guess I should show this,
[33:40] I've got 0.003 balance left. And so I'm gonna just send 0.0015,
[33:49] because to unstake also requires funds. So let's see.
[33:56] - Sinbit7 asks, "Wasn't a half a DASH "the minimum to stake through CrowdNote?"
[34:01] - To start earning interest, yes, but in this process, you can send these funds,
[34:08] you won't start earning interest until you reach that minimum, as far as I understand, but.
[34:13] - I see, so it acts as a savings account until you get to the minimum threshold.
[34:18] - Yeah, well, yeah, I think so. I'm not an expert on CrowdNote,
[34:24] I'm an expert on building this, I guess. So now we've got that much in our CrowdNote account,
[34:33] it might not be technically staked because it won't earn interest,
[34:37] but that's in the account, and it would go towards that staking amount
[34:40] for this address. And so I can also unstake the funds,
[34:47] and this is done by percentage. This is based on the SDK that CoolAJ86 made,
[34:54] and so I'm just gonna go ahead and unstake all of it, actually.
[34:59] - And I think that that percentage, I think it was percentage in the API as well,
[35:07] which is why it trickled down to the SDK, and now the UI. So, API designers out there,
[35:14] just know that your choice of API is potentially going to trickle
[35:19] all the way down to your users. - And so is it a, would it be safe to say
[35:25] that this API is not currently compatible with CrowdNote's trustless staking solution
[35:33] that starts at a minimum of 100 dash? - Yes, that is true.
[35:37] As soon as CrowdNote gives us, gives the community an API to work with
[35:47] for the trustless version, we will implement that API.
[35:52] We'll enhance the SDK with those API endpoints, and we'll be able to make that trustless process
[36:02] much smoother than it is right now by automating some of the signing,
[36:08] which is a lot of the other tooling that CoolAJ86 has made.
[36:13] We can, we have that signing functionality in JavaScript tooling already,
[36:21] so we can update the SDK, the CLI, the graphical user interface,
[36:27] all of that as soon as we get an API for the trustless part. So, please badger them, pester them,
[36:36] encourage them, whatever you can do to get that as a priority for them.
[36:41] That would be great, 'cause I think that we have seen some,
[36:46] I think we have four trustless nodes now, but if the process were a lot more streamlined,
[36:53] I think it would be much, much higher. And I think there are a lot of people
[36:58] that are probably waiting on the sidelines, like myself, that are waiting for that trustless API
[37:05] to make the smooth process before they'll even join, so. - Yeah, I would love that myself.
[37:11] - Is there anything else for us to see on this demo, Jojo? - Sure, I mean, it's just withdrawing the funds,
[37:19] but actually I'll use this as an example. I can send all of the funds to the other address.
[37:27] So now my entire balance is there. - So as you can see, this is,
[37:36] we went a little bit above and beyond what was strictly required,
[37:40] because we could have actually implemented CrowdNode and put a UI on top of that,
[37:49] on top of their functions without having an in-browser wallet,
[37:54] but we do take that extra step so that you can actually send funds to the application,
[38:00] which stores it in your browser storage, encrypted, and then you can kind of manage funds in a browser wallet
[38:09] in addition to managing funds on the CrowdNode side. So there's a two-step process.
[38:14] You send funds to the browser wallet that's displayed here, and then you can also then stake that into CrowdNode,
[38:21] so it can then go from the wallet in your browser to CrowdNode, and before I forget,
[38:27] this is not, I don't think it's deployed yet anyways, but it's not ready for anybody
[38:35] to be putting money through at this point. We still need to test it.
[38:40] - Okay. - Correct.
[38:44] - Okay, is there anything else for us to see on this demo? I saw you had just encrypted the wallet, righteous,
[38:49] and do you have-- - Correct. - Okay.
[38:51] - So this just encrypts the data that's stored in your browser.
[38:55] So if you're using a shared computer or something, that will just make it a little more secure
[38:59] so your keys can't be directly copied, and it will also decrypt them, so.
[39:05] And right now, we're just using emojis, but I would like to get these icons updated
[39:10] with some real icons, but now these are unlocked again and useful.
[39:15] - I did like the stake icon, though, if you ever thought to leave that one in,
[39:19] I wouldn't mind that, yeah. - And the takeout?
[39:22] - That's fine too. Okay.
[39:26] - Okay. So, okay, well, I think, Rion,
[39:31] does that cover everything we wanted to see here? - Yeah, I think so.
[39:35] We'll probably be opening up some bounties for testing this, giving feedback,
[39:39] user experience feedback as well as technical feedback, so be on the lookout for that.
[39:47] - Very good. Well, Jojo, it was sure a pleasure having you on today.
[39:52] So I will join Lavi and Bloch by saying good day to you,
[39:56] and we look forward to maybe touching base about this project again in the future.
[40:01] - Awesome, thank you. Thanks for having me on.
[40:06] - Definitely. And, oh, I guess we can get one last question here.
[40:10] What about the benefits of pseudonymous work if the Dash price appreciates significantly?
[40:15] Just a thought. - Yeah.
[40:18] Yep, and you never want to be telling people what your holdings are anyway,
[40:24] so that shouldn't be a problem even if you're not pseudonymous,
[40:27] but keep your funds private. - Righteous.
[40:34] Okay, very good. We were just pleased to talk with you this week, everyone,
[40:39] and we'll be pleased to see you again next week at the same time, the same place.
[40:44] Goodbye. - Bye, everyone.
