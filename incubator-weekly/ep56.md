[00:00] (upbeat music) - Central bank digital currencies,
[00:11] this isn't just the Bank of England considering this, is it?
[00:14] - Exactly, currently more than 90% of central banks globally are all working on bringing out
[00:20] a central bank digital currency. And I think it's really important to elaborate
[00:24] on what exactly that is. A central bank digital currency
[00:27] is basically what we have now. So it's fiat currency,
[00:30] but it's gonna be entirely digital, which means absolutely in the control of the government
[00:35] and the central bank. So as you mentioned, government, since they own it,
[00:38] they're able to program it in a way that we've never seen before.
[00:42] So as you said, if for whatever reason you don't do as you're told
[00:44] and you don't take three vaccines, four vaccines or whatever it is,
[00:48] the money can just be programmed to be used against you. The perfect example is right now
[00:53] during this supposed climate crisis where they want to implement a carbon allowance.
[00:58] So how do you do that? Well, it's very simple.
[01:00] You just program the money in a way that you cannot do with the current cash that we have.
[01:05] - There it is, pumping 10.8 trillion yuan into the banking system.
[01:15] For all that pumping that's been going on, it doesn't seem to have produced much
[01:19] by the way of economic results. We're led to believe that that 10.8 trillion,
[01:22] that flood of credit into the economy engineered some massive robust recovery and economic boom.
[01:28] Reality could not have been farther from the case. Now China's economy didn't crash,
[01:32] but ever since then, it has been slowing and slowing and slowing
[01:36] and then slowing some more, which has led to these RRR cuts
[01:40] and other measures by central banks around the world, not the other way around.
[01:43] Central bank policies are a response to issues in the real economy,
[01:48] not a solution for those problems. (upbeat music)
[01:55] - Cloud storage. It allows us to access our files conveniently
[01:59] via the internet across multiple devices wherever we are. The cloud storage industry has boomed in recent years.
[02:06] Some of the most common consumer grade services include Google Drive, iCloud and Dropbox.
[02:12] People use these for their photos, videos, documents and all kinds of other files
[02:17] because it's a cost-effective way to make data accessible and also share it.
[02:22] Cloud storage has become a crucial part of our lives, but when you use the most popular cloud storage providers,
[02:28] you're handing your data off to someone else so that they can look after it for you.
[02:34] What are the privacy implications of this? (upbeat music)
[02:39] - Well, this takes us right back to basically where we were at the beginning
[02:45] where your drunk, insolvent Uncle Sam has to issue more and more and more of these treasuries
[02:52] into a market where there might not be a buyer. Interest rates go up even higher,
[02:58] asset prices go down even further, tax receipts go down. Janet Yellen's deficit problem becomes even more extreme
[03:07] and the cycle just continues to repeat itself over and over again,
[03:12] taking us right into the fiscal and economic abyss. This is the QT doom loop.
[03:20] So the main takeaway is the government is now admitting that they might be completely broke by July of this year.
[03:28] And the debt ceiling or increasing that debt ceiling by no means fixes the problem
[03:37] because this is what we really should be worried about. (upbeat music)
[03:46] - If we move towards full central bank digital currencies, but I don't want government to control
[03:52] potentially every aspect of my life. Presumably, this could be the biggest thing
[03:57] that's ever happened to Bitcoin and other crypto coins. - It's about being a sovereign individual
[04:03] because money is the energy which fuels your life. So if you don't have control of your money,
[04:08] you don't have control over anything and you, in my opinion, really just become a slave
[04:12] because if the government can make your money expire, if the government can freeze it
[04:17] in the name of terrorism or national security, then what freedom do you have in society as an individual?
[04:22] You have none. (upbeat music)
[04:25] - Hello, and welcome to Incubator Weekly. Great to see everybody.
[04:39] How are you today, Ryan? How are you today, AJ?
[04:41] - I'm good. I hope I am coming through okay.
[04:45] I'm having a little bit of a connection issue, but hopefully you can hear me.
[04:49] - We can hear you at least. And you, AJ, how is your connection?
[04:54] - It should be perfect. - Well, okay.
[04:58] No two ways about that. So Ryan and I introduced ourselves last week,
[05:04] but hey, this new character, AJ, is a new face. AJ O'Neill, will you tell us
[05:11] just a little bit about yourself? - Sure.
[05:14] I'm AJ, I'm a technophobic technologist, equal opportunity offender, chief offending officer,
[05:19] dangerous wrong thinker, father of two. - Wow, great.
[05:24] And you are a developer within the Dash Incubator also, yes? - Yes, and I happen to be a software engineer.
[05:32] - Right on, right on. Okay, so today's show is going to consist of three segments.
[05:40] The first segment is going to be an overview of a bounty within the incubator at this time
[05:48] called Payment Tools Project. And Ryan is going to go through a Q&A with AJ,
[05:54] who is the lead developer on that. Next, we'll move into a discussion
[05:59] of whether it is important for blockchain developers to be paid in the crypto that they work on.
[06:07] And then finally, we're going to wrap up with Ryan giving us a overview of incubators finances.
[06:16] Yeah, good. So Ryan, let's kick it over to you
[06:20] to start the overview of AJ's project. - Well, I'll kick it right back over to AJ
[06:27] because I think that we'll have plenty to talk about today. So AJ, let me just ask you like the most obvious question.
[06:36] What are you doing and why are you doing it on this project? - Well, let me tell you, bring up my screen here.
[06:44] So I'm working on the Payment Tool Project has kind of evolved.
[06:48] Basically what happened is as I've come into the ecosystem, what I've discovered is that everything is very large
[06:56] and bulky and old and crufty. So on the Dash Core desktop side and server side,
[07:04] you've got all this C++ code that's all packed tight together.
[07:07] Everything is just one giant blob. And the Dash Core JS replicates that.
[07:14] So everything there is just one big giant blob. And the documentation is scattered all over the place.
[07:21] So if you want to find out about something and you're not a cryptocurrency native,
[07:26] then you've got to go over and look at BIP32 and BIP39 and BIP44 and BIP43.
[07:31] And you got to look at some Dash documentation, but it's not all updated.
[07:34] And a lot of it still says Bitcoin and BitCore and BitThis and BitThat.
[07:38] And so what this became was, okay, let's break these things down into Lego bytes
[07:45] or byte size, make them building block Legos that I can understand a component
[07:51] and I can understand another component and I can understand another component.
[07:54] And then I can put them together to build a thing rather than here's this whole huge thing
[08:01] and I can't even tell which piece does what. And that's resulted in either,
[08:09] oh, and then also there's the issue of, especially in the web world,
[08:14] is that these things are very, very large. So Jojobite said that it's a million lines of code
[08:19] for Dash Core. And a lot of that is because it was built a decade ago
[08:25] and has never really been updated 'cause it comes off of BitCore, BitCore JS.
[08:29] - Dash Core Lib, I think you mean, right? - Not Dash Core, the C++,
[08:33] but Dash Core Lib, the JavaScript library that was built from Core.
[08:36] - Yeah, Dash Core JS or, yeah, yeah. - Oh, you're talking about Dash, Dash SDK.
[08:42] Either one of those, they're both very big. - Okay, well--
[08:47] - One of them is 1.6 megabytes and one of them is 0.8 megabytes.
[08:50] - And that's minified. - Minified, yes.
[08:53] - That's what it's already been processed. - Minified and gzipped.
[08:57] So that's the smallest it's possibly going to get in a web application.
[09:01] If you want to make a web application, you want to include Dash functionality,
[09:07] you're going to be, you're asking all of your users to download 1.6 megabytes.
[09:11] I talked a little bit about this in the proposal text from the last quarter's proposal,
[09:16] but this is one of my main concerns. So we do want to have to,
[09:20] we want to trim that down as much as we can. So that's part of the motivation here.
[09:27] - Yeah, yeah, and that's big. And there's a lot of problems that,
[09:31] one, you've got dependency hell, which is there's hundreds of things
[09:35] that you don't know or understand that are being brought into that,
[09:38] that it makes it very difficult to audit, makes it very difficult to get the whole picture.
[09:43] And then you also have that no reasonable person is going to include that on their page
[09:48] for a payment that people just aren't using yet. Here, try this out.
[09:52] It's only a 1.6 megabyte load time. It's only going to add 10 seconds
[09:57] to your mobile user's experience. It's not, it's not a viable solution.
[10:02] But a lot of that is because this was built as a port of the C++ code and built for the server.
[10:08] And so all of the bundling that happens on the browser, most of it is including things
[10:12] that are either frizzle-less, excessive, or no longer necessary.
[10:15] So with this, I've either hand-selected other forks or other libraries that people have built independently
[10:24] or rewritten from scratch the most basic atomic particles of the, of what's necessary to do
[10:32] all of the offline action. So this, this, which may be dash SDK core
[10:38] is not the right name for it. So we'll figure that out.
[10:40] But this collection of tools, dash tools, is the atomic building blocks.
[10:46] And the first one is secp256k1. Now I brought this in from Noble Crypto,
[10:52] which is a fresh, modern, browser-first library for all of the math stuff that happens.
[10:59] The elliptic curve, all of the real nitty gritty that deals with the bits and the bytes
[11:04] for the signing, the public keys, all that stuff. And so this one, I didn't really do much to
[11:10] other than give it a light wrapping layer to make it a little bit easier to export in more ways.
[11:16] Because most developers are not cryptocurrency developers and most developers aren't even working on apps
[11:23] in the way that startup people think of them. Most of them are working on things like WordPress.
[11:27] And that's where we're, I believe, we're going to get people is the people that are hosting
[11:33] their, their, you know, Shopify, WordPress. They're not actually software developers.
[11:39] They're just people that are taking tools and bringing things together.
[11:42] And they want just a script tag or two that they can include to have something work.
[11:47] And so I went with that mindset. And so I took this library and I just massaged it
[11:51] a little bit so that it, it works better. And it works in node and in browser.
[11:56] So it'll work in the server environment and it'll work in the client environment.
[11:58] But there's not, not too much extra that I did there. Dash keys is all of the encoding
[12:05] and the hash primitives, but all together in one. So rather than have it across several dependencies,
[12:11] the truth of the matter is there is no one else that I've ever heard of in any of all of software
[12:17] engineering that is using base X, which is one of the encoding primitives.
[12:21] And likewise for the, the primitive that's built on top of that base 58.
[12:25] And then likewise for the primitive that's built on top of that base 58 check.
[12:29] And then likewise for a little bit aside, but the hashing function that's used ripe MD one 60.
[12:36] These are things that are exclusively used in cryptocurrency.
[12:40] They have never been adopted anywhere else. And so it makes sense to just bring those together
[12:45] into one package and have them documented together and have them delivered together
[12:51] because there's no other use case for them. It's not like, oh, well, I'm going to build this other app.
[12:58] And then I'm also going to need any of these tools. If you're doing cryptocurrencies,
[13:01] you're going to need all those tools. If you're not doing cryptocurrencies,
[13:03] you're never going to need them. So dash keys brings all that together
[13:06] so that the encoding of private keys into wallet import format with can happen in there,
[13:12] as well as the encoding of the address format from the hash of the public key, the pub key hash,
[13:18] as well as the encoding for the experts and the X pub. So all of the encoding stuff that we think of
[13:24] as our private key and our payment address and related byte formats,
[13:30] all of the encoding for that to make it human readable, other than the QR code, which is a layer on top of this,
[13:35] all of that's in dash keys. Then dash phrase is your recovery phrase generator.
[13:41] So it'll generate the recovery phrase from the list of words,
[13:44] and then it will convert that into a seed. It will encode that as a seed.
[13:50] And again, these, there's some primitives here that before they were split out into different packages
[13:56] and different classes. And I just, I brought this together.
[13:59] I rewrote it. It works in the browser and it works in node.
[14:03] And all of this is in one because you're not going to need these things
[14:07] outside of a recovery phrase. They're not used for anything else
[14:11] in the cryptocurrency space. And this is actually useful just generally.
[14:15] This is something that I had started working on before I was heavily involved in Dash Incubator.
[14:21] And so I actually took my previous version of this and then brought that into Dash Incubator
[14:25] and completed it specifically for Dash. So that's another thing, all of these,
[14:29] the options are all set for Dash by default, but you could use these with other cryptocurrencies
[14:34] to test them out. And then Dash HD is the creme de la creme.
[14:39] This is where everything comes together. This has the various types of hashing functions
[14:46] for hierarchical derivation so that you can take your recovery phrase,
[14:51] you can turn that into a wallet account. This is also what would be used, for example,
[14:55] in Dash Pay where you want to have a contact either via QR code or sending it over the network.
[15:00] You need to get somebody what's known as the XPub. This is the key structure, the hash structure
[15:07] from which you can generate millions and millions of addresses.
[15:09] So you give somebody one XPub, one QR code, one network request to a contact,
[15:15] and then they can send money to you for the rest of their life
[15:18] without ever needing to contact you directly again. So that's kind of the key feature of Dash HD
[15:25] other than that you're getting recoverable keys, which is what we want.
[15:29] And it's really important. I mean, Dash Core Desktop does not turn on
[15:35] recovery by default. If something gets corrupt in that directory,
[15:39] it's kaput. So this is something that's really, really important.
[15:42] It's turned on by default in the mobile wallet and some of the other software,
[15:45] but the hierarchical wallets are what make it possible to feel safe that you've got those 12 words
[15:52] locked in your safe box, it's recoverable. And then here, the last thing that I think
[15:59] that I wanted to go over with this is just the documentation.
[16:02] And I'm gonna use Dash HD. The other libraries are documented as well
[16:07] in a similar format, but this is the one that I think is the most complete
[16:11] because it has the most components. It's the most complex.
[16:13] And so when you hit one of these libraries as a developer, you're gonna see right up at the top,
[16:17] and this one's got a little bit more information because it does a little bit more,
[16:21] but you're gonna see, okay, here are examples of the inputs or outputs.
[16:25] So if I kind of know what I'm doing, I can look just at the top here and say,
[16:29] yes, this is the library that I'm looking for because yeah, I recognize this is an HD path
[16:33] or okay, I recognize this is an XPRIV. And so I know just from the first couple of seconds,
[16:40] am I in the right ballpark or am I out of the ballpark on what this thing is gonna do?
[16:45] And then they each have a table of contents. They have instructions on how to install.
[16:50] This one, because of the layering of it, has a little bit of depth to it where there's an overview,
[16:56] which we'll go to real quick. And this is just super, super, super fast
[17:00] and basically one screen. Here's just about everything this can do really quick.
[17:06] But if you're not familiar with it, the overview is not really gonna help you as much
[17:10] because you have a little bit more to learn. So there's also a quick start,
[17:13] very similar to the overview, but then broken down with here's how to handle errors.
[17:18] Here's some special conditions you need to be aware of, but just really light, just kind of more of the refresher.
[17:23] Then we have the API section, which is all of the different conversions, formats,
[17:29] things that this does, all condensed down as to how the functions are called.
[17:36] And then past that, we have each of them are broken down piece by piece
[17:41] with all the documentation that you need in order to operate this is in one place,
[17:45] not scattered across the entire internet. So we just go down and down and down here.
[17:50] Eventually we're gonna hit the tutorial section, which again is similar to the production overstart,
[17:55] except that it's for people that are yet a little bit newer, really need some handholding.
[17:59] So the tutorial section also references the API and the glossary sections.
[18:05] We'll just kind of go down here. So this walkthrough tutorial, again, like I said,
[18:11] it's just got more information. It's got more of the nuanced detail
[18:15] that you might not know if you're just getting started. It has a little bit more commenting.
[18:19] It has a little bit more code example, but essentially it's just, we're just looking at it.
[18:25] What scope of level of a developer are you? Do you need the full handholding experience?
[18:30] Do you need the refresher or do you need just, let me see what the functions are.
[18:33] I know which one I'm looking for when I see it kind of thing. And then down here, we have the glossary,
[18:38] which is where I've combined the terminology that's from the different BIPs,
[18:42] from the different libraries, and then not just the official names,
[18:47] but also the colloquial names, because there's a lot of times
[18:50] where you're searching for something, but it's referenced in many different ways,
[18:53] like PKH, pubkeyhash, publickeyhash. You might not know that PKH stands for publickeyhash.
[19:00] So if you just do a search here and you look for PKH,
[19:04] oh wait, this library doesn't deal with that. That's the dash keys deals with that.
[19:08] So nevermind, bad example. It's not in here, but this one has,
[19:14] you can see where in some of these, it says also key HD private key with address.
[19:21] So these are other terms that are synonymous with this term as we go through.
[19:27] - So as you, you were just about to, you called out one term that actually wasn't on the page.
[19:33] So I'm wondering maybe we could refactor this to have in the master glossary in that super repo
[19:40] or whatever you call it. - Yeah, so that is in progress right here.
[19:46] - Absolutely everything. 'Cause let me just say when I discovered you,
[19:52] which actually was many, many years ago, we live in the same town,
[19:56] but when I rediscovered you, you were doing some kind of PayPal integration
[20:00] into one of your websites. And I don't know if it was there specifically
[20:05] or somewhere else, but I've noticed along the way that you just do an excellent job of documenting everything.
[20:12] And that is worth so much because as kind of a novice developer myself,
[20:19] it's very hard to navigate these waters. And I've been doing cryptocurrency for like a decade now.
[20:26] And so I've read Andreas Antonopoulos' Mastering Bitcoin book, for example.
[20:31] So I know most of this stuff now, but even in that book,
[20:36] it's still difficult to, as a developer, really know exactly how to use these things
[20:43] and what they really mean. So this is a great resource.
[20:46] And speaking from the incubator's perspective, we need something like this if for no other reason
[20:53] than to be able to train new developers who are interested in the lower level intricacies
[20:59] of what's going on here so that we don't have knowledge just captured
[21:04] within six heads in Dash. We need this stuff to be very digestible
[21:10] for anybody who is, it takes some talent and it takes some skill
[21:16] to kind of grasp the concepts, but that's a necessary but not sufficient condition.
[21:22] You also need the smarts, but also the resources. And so this will bring,
[21:28] if somebody is like a talented developer that has no idea what cryptocurrency is all about,
[21:33] they could consume this and basically be up to speed in a month maybe instead of years.
[21:41] - Yeah, I mean, it definitely takes hands-on practice. The documentation alone isn't going to solve your problem.
[21:47] And there are nuances that are, I try to make more apparent,
[21:52] but that you do have to go through a little bit of trial by fire to understand.
[21:57] For example, the term passphrase is overloaded and misused across the ecosystem
[22:06] because in cryptography, we already have a concept of passphrase
[22:10] that has a specific meaning. In BIP44, I don't remember if it's BIP39 or BIP44,
[22:17] I get the numbers mixed up, but in one of the BIPs, it's referenced as one thing.
[22:21] In another one of the BIPs, it's referenced as not just the one thing,
[22:25] but two other independent things, including the industry standard definition.
[22:30] When you're learning about pubkey hash and address and stuff like that,
[22:34] it's a nuanced difference that they're the same thing, except one means the text representation
[22:41] that someone would see in the mobile app. The other one refers to the byte representation.
[22:46] So it gets kind of confusing with some of these things. Okay, address, wait, isn't this address?
[22:50] Isn't that address? Well, yes, this is address if it's been encoded as text.
[22:55] Take the same bytes, has the same meaning to the computer, decode it as a byte stream, now it's PKH.
[23:02] So there's a lot of that nuance that I tried to capture. Let me pull this back up on the screen here.
[23:10] As you can see right here, there's the pubkey hash definition.
[23:13] But if you are not, it's very easy, even with the documentation,
[23:18] there's a little bit of trial by fire that you're always gonna have to do.
[23:21] - Yeah, so this, it is fortuitous that we have, well, I guess technically all three of us
[23:29] are blockchain developers, and I'm defining a blockchain developer
[23:34] as anybody who gets paid in by, technically, I guess Ryan is the main
[23:45] blockchain developer here, right? Because when the super block
[23:49] pays out of the Dash blockchain, it goes into however many wallets it goes into,
[23:56] and then being the proposal owner, Ryan then divvies the payments out
[24:00] to contributors as necessary. But those details aside,
[24:05] technically all three of us are blockchain developers, as is Pete behind the boards today.
[24:10] And something that we got to talking about just loosely last week and then realized as we were,
[24:16] like, hmm, this is something we'd like to talk about with more people is, is it important?
[24:23] And if so, how important for a blockchain developer, whether it be software, marketing,
[24:31] business development, design, what have you, to be paid in the crypto that he or she works on?
[24:37] - Yeah, so we had a little after party, not official, but we kind of did a debrief last week,
[24:46] and we ended up talking about some of this stuff. And I just wanted to bring this
[24:50] more to a public conversation, because I think it's so important,
[24:53] and it's one of incubators primary values. So I thought it was appropriate.
[24:57] And I don't know when, should I press present here to get my screen going?
[25:03] - Yeah, go ahead. - So let me just share screen.
[25:07] And okay, and we'll share a Chrome tab. (mouse clicking)
[25:15] No, a window. Hmm.
[25:20] - Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. - I think this is the one.
[25:25] Let's see if this is the one. - That's the one.
[25:29] - Three tabs, yes, okay. I have way too many windows up,
[25:32] way too many tabs in each window. I'm gonna go back to my screen.
[25:37] So this is our monthly proposal, and I just wanted to kind of,
[25:41] I guess we're not quite into this segment, but as you can see, obviously,
[25:46] the Dash blockchain pays out in Dash. So the incubator asks for 1,000 Dash per month.
[25:53] And that, to me, is like the basis of how accounting should start.
[25:58] Like, we are a new currency. We are, to use Tao of Satoshi's term,
[26:05] we are a Dash nation that, basically, we have our own currency.
[26:11] And I think it's very important that we use that currency to its fullest extent.
[26:17] So money is a medium of exchange, a store of value, a unit of account.
[26:23] We've all heard these things. The unit of account, I think,
[26:26] is more important than we really realize. And so incubator does all of its accounting in Dash.
[26:34] So we're using it as a unit of account. And we only do payments in Dash.
[26:42] We don't support any kind of fiat payments. And I know that other organizations do, obviously.
[26:50] Dash Core Group does. My hope is that we, as a community,
[26:56] we, as a nation, whatever, as an economy, as I like to put it,
[27:00] that we move towards using Dash as a currency to the fullest extent.
[27:07] And so, like I said, we do that in the incubator. And when you, it's kind of interesting what happens
[27:13] when you kind of just make that decision. You make that decision, I'm going to do my finances,
[27:20] my payments, my savings, all in Dash. And sometimes you have to convert to fiat to pay a bill.
[27:28] But most people think of it in the opposite sense, where sometimes, they do all their thinking
[27:32] and they do all their accounting in US dollars or whatever. And then sometimes they'll convert some of that,
[27:40] some of those dollars into Dash, and then they'll maybe buy something with it.
[27:43] But when you flip the switch and you say, by default, everything is in Dash, things happen.
[27:51] Like, for example, I've kind of forced myself to, because I receive all my income in Dash,
[28:01] I have to find ways to use Dash in the most efficient way. And so I've actually convinced my landlords
[28:08] for many, many years to accept Dash. And that's what happens, not just with me,
[28:14] but with every single incubator developer. I'm sure AJ can actually also say something
[28:19] about this as well, because he gets paid in Dash. And I know that he actually does payments forward in Dash.
[28:28] So maybe you could talk a little bit about that, AJ. - Yeah, I think, I'm not a true convert like you are,
[28:36] but I believe that anytime you're doing work, you need to use the product.
[28:40] That is my pet peeve with, being a software developer, that's my pet peeve with all softwares.
[28:44] It's apparent that people who develop Google Maps, they sit in an office building,
[28:49] they walk one block to get to their dormitory, they've never driven a car in their life.
[28:54] They obviously, you know, and so the same thing, I get frustrated with the Dash tools,
[28:59] because to me, it looks like people aren't using this, because if they were using this on a daily basis,
[29:05] they would know that this does not work when I'm standing in line at Best Buy.
[29:10] This does not work when I'm trying to pay a contractor, et cetera, right?
[29:15] And so I think that it is incredibly important to eat your own dog food and not just blindly follow along
[29:24] with, okay, here was some spec, here was some idea, here was some proposal.
[29:27] No, you need to use it and figure out, does it work in the real world,
[29:32] not just does it work in the theory of the unicorn world? And it's interesting you mentioned Dash Nation,
[29:39] because that's the term that I independently started using when I'm talking to people.
[29:43] I say, well, Dash is not just, it's not a cryptocurrency, it is a belief system that people buy into
[29:51] that's, dare I say, libertarian, hopefully not to offend anybody out there
[29:55] that doesn't believe that that's what this is, but that's the way I see it.
[29:58] It's get out of my life, let me make, as an adult, agreements with other adults,
[30:05] and figure out what we believe together and not have that thrust down upon us.
[30:10] Yet within that system, we still have all of the same constraints and opportunities
[30:15] as with many other monetary systems. We wanna save, we want to put some things
[30:20] in a business account, we wanna put some things in a personal account,
[30:23] and we need tools for that. And I think that's where,
[30:27] I believe that's where Dash Incubator is going to be really shining this year and next year
[30:33] as we continue to develop the tools that have been seeded here.
[30:38] - So what I was hearing from you, Ryan, is that a blockchain developer getting paid
[30:42] in the crypto they work on necessarily forces them to expand the economy
[30:47] of that cryptocurrency because they're looking for, okay, who's going to accept this
[30:53] for the various things that I need to spend? Even if it's no more, no less
[30:57] than I'm gonna sell it all for fiat, they're still looking for a broker
[31:02] or an exchange to do that. And then what I was hearing from you, AJ,
[31:06] is that a blockchain developer getting paid in crypto is going to improve his work
[31:11] because now he's using the product in real life as opposed to just working on it
[31:16] in the abstract or in theory. And I see both of those and would add maybe a third,
[31:23] which is, I think that a blockchain developer getting paid in the crypto that he works on
[31:30] also is going to create a sort of, whether he knows it or not,
[31:34] is gonna create a sort of shift in his mind as it pertains to, dare I say, loyalties or allegiances,
[31:44] which- 100% could not agree more.
[31:46] Yeah, because I've wondered before- It's subtle.
[31:49] Employees who get paid in stocks or have the option to take some of their payment in stocks.
[31:55] I've thought before, like, what if, you know, an Apple employee were being paid in Microsoft stock
[32:02] or a Coke employee paid in Pepsi stock? Like a lot- A lot of them do, actually,
[32:07] which creates that loyalty. Yeah, and so it creates someone who's, you know,
[32:13] I guess, looking to serve two masters, I guess. And as the saying goes, no man can serve two masters.
[32:19] And so that's another dynamic that I like to think about of just, you know, what-
[32:26] I think the user named Badger on Dash Central, he said something the other day, like, you know,
[32:34] at the end of the day, if Dash's developers don't need Dash to do well in order for their families
[32:41] to eat, you know, that's going to change things. Yeah, it's kind of like burning the ships.
[32:48] You know, you cross an ocean and you discover this new land and you might be tempted to go back
[32:56] to your former abode or land, but the truly dedicated, they just burn the ships.
[33:04] You know, you get there, you burn the ships. There's no getting back.
[33:07] You just have to make your way in this new land. And that's what we've done, so, or continue to do.
[33:13] So anyway, do we want to go? I did want to talk about a little bit about
[33:20] how we actually do that, those payments and whatnot in the Dash incubator, just for everybody's understanding
[33:31] of how it works and that everybody can know where this data is.
[33:38] And I brought up this proposal first because I just wanted everybody to know
[33:42] that you can recreate this data if you'd like. So you see these plots here, these figures,
[33:51] and I want to let everybody know where these come from so that they can either double check them
[33:59] or kind of create their own tables or views. So it all comes from this Dash incubator accounting sheet,
[34:08] and this has been public since day one. So we'll drop a link to it, I'm sure,
[34:13] in the video description here. But when we do work in the incubator,
[34:19] right now we're doing work using Trello as a project management tool.
[34:27] We have been trying over the months to switch over because it's not quite ideal for us.
[34:35] But when somebody comes and makes a claim, they do that or they want to work on a project.
[34:42] First, you sign up here. Then if you want to create a new project,
[34:45] you request a new concept to be considered from amongst the incubator strategists.
[34:53] And if one of those incubator strategists accept it, then it becomes one of these cards.
[34:59] And let's just say, let's bring up this, the project that we're working on right now,
[35:05] which is Incubator Updates. We could probably rename this to Incubator Weekly
[35:10] 'cause that's what this is. This is the project that we're doing right now.
[35:16] As you can see, my computer is really struggling because it's pretty old
[35:24] and I'm doing the streaming software, but let's see. As that pulls up, that's one of the things.
[35:33] Trello is actually one of the worst offenders when it comes to...
[35:36] - We can hear you, Ryan, but there is a sort of freezing. - We could hear you.
[35:52] - Oh, he's disappeared. The internet took him.
[35:56] - This was actually planned. So while Ryan is reconnecting,
[36:04] whatever he is reconnecting on his end, I wanted to make mention of something
[36:11] that we said on the show last week, which was that this week,
[36:15] we intended to give a full walkthrough of the incubator's workflow,
[36:21] which is to say like, these are the various websites that are used.
[36:25] This is the steps that one would take, which Ryan just, again, talking about just a little bit,
[36:30] to sign up to be a contributor, to either try to claim a bounty
[36:34] or even propose a fresh brand new bounty. And Ryan asked that we hold off
[36:43] on doing that full walkthrough for a future week because I guess the processes are seeking to be improved.
[36:51] Something about Trello and GitHub, I don't know. Don't ask me.
[36:55] So to touch back on that point, the full walkthrough of like a,
[37:02] hey, how to incubator steps one, two, and three is something that we will do in the future.
[37:09] Today was intended rather to be just an overview of the accounting process of the incubator
[37:19] so that if and when one would like to do a financial audit to whatever extent,
[37:27] that it's basically one goes to the treasury proposal. And in fact, maybe I can screen share from my side,
[37:35] especially if we have lost dear Ryan for good. - Yeah, he said that his computer ran out of battery.
[37:44] It looks like, oh, and he's back. - I was still alive.
[37:48] - Well, hello, Ryan. You fellows sure like to keep me on my toes, don't you?
[37:56] - Sorry about that. I'm blaming it on the presidents, by the way.
[37:59] This was President's Day problem because I went to the office and it was closed
[38:03] because of President's Day 'cause I work at a university for a coworking space.
[38:07] Anyway, I'm back. - Would you like to share your screen again
[38:12] or would you like me to share the same thing from my end, at least the Dash Central page?
[38:18] - I'll share it. - Okay.
[38:20] - Yeah, let's see. Okay.
[38:24] - Name that song. Whoever can name this song,
[38:26] I'm gonna give you a little treat. ♪ Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do ♪
[38:34] - I know this is- - And it's back to you, Ryan.
[38:36] - I don't, I'm not able to name it, but- - No, the treat is for you guys.
[38:40] It's for the viewers. Please continue.
[38:42] - Okay. So when somebody does a claim on a project,
[38:47] they enter it into the Trello board and then basically everything that is entered
[38:55] in the Trello board in terms of claims gets copied over. So somebody might claim task seven,
[39:05] for example, right here. And then when that claim is approved,
[39:09] it's the information is copied over to this spreadsheet, basically word for word,
[39:17] and just put into the various data fields. And that makes up this table.
[39:23] And then this table, you know, there's the address that is paid from the claim,
[39:31] and there's the output links. And then if the project is paid,
[39:36] then the transaction ID would go here. If it's not paid, somebody would write ready right here,
[39:41] and then it would populate a page for me to make a payment for that.
[39:46] But that's how basically this page is made. And you can see exactly what all the payments have been
[39:53] from the history from day one. Then that feeds over into this reward summary page
[40:04] where the data is put into summary tables, pivot tables. And then that's just copied over into,
[40:14] and then you make charts from that. So all of this is open to the public again.
[40:21] So that's where these figures all come from. I just wanted everybody to kind of know exactly
[40:28] where our tables come from in the proposals. That's where it comes from.
[40:32] And if anybody has any further questions about that, I'm happy to answer those,
[40:37] but that's probably enough for people to know where to get started if they want to look deeper into that.
[40:44] - Great. Okay, so if that covers the finance overview segment,
[40:52] while you were getting situated, Ryan, I let the viewers know that you had expressed to me
[41:01] that we'd like to hold off on the sort of workflow walkthrough
[41:06] because of maybe some planned migration or something or some planned tweak to it.
[41:14] Is that something that you could enlighten us about? - It'll be better.
[41:17] We'll do the deep dive walkthrough about exactly how to get started with the incubator
[41:21] and how tasks are managed and how claims are made and all that, like the process of doing work
[41:30] and then claiming the tasks for those works and getting paid and all that.
[41:34] We'll do that when we actually do our full switch over to GitHub.
[41:37] - And what do you mean by full switch over to GitHub? You mean goodbye Trello?
[41:41] This can all be done via GitHub? What do you mean?
[41:44] - Well, we haven't fully decided yet, but we're all leaning towards
[41:47] just fully going over to GitHub. But there is a small chance that we might leave it open
[41:52] to have different platforms and that each strategist could have their own
[41:57] project management tool. And so maybe if somebody wanted to stay on the Trello board
[42:03] they could, but as far as I'm concerned, personally Trello doesn't suit my needs
[42:09] as well as GitHub does. Most of our work is software development.
[42:14] So, and most software development is done on GitHub. So it makes more sense to just have the project management
[42:22] there and GitHub's made a lot of progress in those terms recently.
[42:26] So that's why we're considering moving over. And when we do, we'll kind of create a new demo
[42:32] of how to do that. If anybody's interested in knowing how to do this right now,
[42:40] Joelle Valenzuela has made a video and we'll post a link to that walkthrough
[42:48] of how to do it in the Trello board. - Righteous.
[42:53] Well, that wraps up our three segments for today. AJ, Disruption Master,
[43:00] is there, are there any thoughts you'd care to leave us with?
[43:03] Oh, Holly, why are you muted? - Oh, that was me.
[43:12] I muted myself. Sorry, I wanted to be able to fart
[43:16] and not let everybody know. - As we've discussed before.
[43:19] Well, thanks for that. Okay.
[43:21] - Yeah, it's okay. I did that one time live.
[43:23] I thought I was muted, but anyway, I was just saying. - You've done it more than once live.
[43:27] I'll just tell you. I watch them all.
[43:30] - Well, yeah, but sometimes I point it out. You know, I'm like, oh, got to let one loose.
[43:33] But other times, anyway. Yeah, that's what I'd like to leave us with.
[43:37] I'd like everybody to have that imagery and smellagery and sense of my professionalism
[43:43] as I continue working on these tools. - Right on.
[43:47] And Ryan, do you care to respond to Joelle-Louise here? - Sure.
[43:53] Honestly, we're not, I wouldn't say we're promoted anywhere. Like we don't really focus on promoting.
[44:00] Just recently, we have restarted our promotion efforts by, you know, Amanda right here,
[44:07] or right here does have run our Twitter account for the most part.
[44:12] So we are on Twitter. We do have a presence on GitHub,
[44:18] but we're not really actively promoting that either. And we spend a lot of time on Discord.
[44:28] So, but anywhere where you want us to be promoted, we, you know, we're happy to, happy to accommodate.
[44:36] - And if, and dare I say when, the Incubator has its first live event,
[44:41] be it a hackathon or a conference, we'll definitely have the booth babes on order.
[44:46] Okay, we do have one more question here from Joelle. Can you guys hire any former library dubs?
[44:53] - That's a good, I'm glad he phrased it that way, because it gives me an opportunity to say
[44:57] that we don't hire anybody. Everybody is both already hired and will never be hired.
[45:03] You don't have to be hired to work in the Incubator. You just show up and say, I'd like to do this.
[45:11] And the best place to talk, the best place is to talk to either me
[45:17] or one of the strategists or just anybody in the Incubator, and we'll be able to tell you how to get going.
[45:23] But you just, basically you show up and you say, I want to work on this task.
[45:27] And if that's a task that one of the strategists want to pursue, then we get you going.
[45:34] And that said, to really answer the question, yes. I think one of the, one of the things that I want more,
[45:43] more than anything is self-directed developers and self-directed project managers in the Incubator.
[45:50] I don't want to have to, I don't want to be the focal point or the choke point as it were.
[45:56] So if these developers are interested, tell them to, you know, come up with projects,
[46:03] have an idea, come to me with three tasks in mind that you want, you want to do work on this project
[46:10] and it has these three tasks, or I want to start with a specification task.
[46:15] You tell me what you want to do. And I will see if that fits within my strategy.
[46:20] And most things do. I mostly work, mostly looking for motivated self,
[46:26] self-starting, self-directed developers that already know what they, how they can add value to Dash.
[46:33] And then I just kind of help facilitate that and organize it.
[46:38] So yeah, send them our way. And they'd be great to work on some, some library projects
[46:44] if that's still allowed, I guess, by the government. It's such a silly thing.
[46:50] I know they're going through a hard time right now, but I don't know if that is affecting
[46:55] just the front end part of it. There was a separation.
[47:01] There's library and then there's something, Odyssey. Yeah, and I think the problem was with Odyssey,
[47:07] not with library. So I'd love to have some library integrations.
[47:10] Let's talk. - Okay, well, thanks for joining us today
[47:17] on Incubator Weekly, everybody. And we look forward to seeing you next week.
[47:24] Same time, same place. Yeah?
[47:26] - Yep. - Bye for now.
