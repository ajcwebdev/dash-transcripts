## Transcript

[00:00] Crypto is a game changer. Crypto empowers the little guy.

[00:09] What do you think about these statements? Are they both correct?

[00:12] Incorrect? If you would have asked me a decade ago, I would have said that both are correct.

[00:16] But today, I would say that just one is correct. Crypto is a $2 trillion industry.

[00:21] It's disruptive. As is noted on the Atlantic Council's CBDC tracker site, as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins

[00:28] have become more popular, the world's central banks have realized that they need to provide an alternative or let the future of money pass them by.

[00:35] Clearly, crypto is a game changer. This is correct.

[00:38] But this statement is not correct. Only if the word "some" were added would it be correct.

[00:43] This is an important point. All cryptos are not equal.

[00:47] Some cryptos are indeed oriented toward empowering the little guy. But some cryptos strive to do just the opposite, to empower the powers that be.

[00:55] And still other cryptos have different use cases altogether or have been co-opted and are no longer positioned to empower the little guy.

[01:02] Personally, I'm here for the first reason, because I value voluntary interactions and spontaneous order.

[01:08] If you're watching this video, I'd guess you too favor cryptos of this flavor. Thus, rather than use clunky language such as saying cryptos do this or do that, I suggest

[01:18] we each strive for accuracy. This will help one's own orientation and focus to more effectively think and build,

[01:25] and will help others with whom one interacts. An example to demonstrate this point, let's say you're at a gathering.

[01:30] You run into someone you've spoken with casually before, and they ask, "I see more and more mentions of crypto on the news.

[01:36] Are you still so gung-ho about it?" You could respond, "Oh yes, of course.

[01:41] Crypto will only become more dominant." But this assumes that you and the questioner have the same definition for crypto.

[01:47] You may mean cryptos that are decentralized, fast, inexpensive, and offer privacy. But the questioner may picture bitcoin, as that's what talking heads often mention,

[01:56] and take it as a data point to buy some bitcoin. Or the questioner may picture scams and exchange implosions, and thus discount your opinion

[02:04] and question your grasp on reality. Just as precision with coding is important to have a compact, functioning protocol, precision

[02:11] with spoken language is important to make more likely the desired outcome. How could you better frame your advocacy, not for crypto in totality, but for the specific

[02:20] flavor of crypto you support? Again, figuring this out may help you stay focused on solutions.

[02:26] And because you'll be a better spokesperson, more able to plant a seed, thus encouraging others to investigate with an open mind.

[02:32] So again, back to this spectrum. Some cryptos empower the little guy.

[02:36] What ones? Those that are decentralized?

[02:38] Is that enough? Those that are usable, in terms of a network that is always up, is scalable, has a very

[02:44] slight transaction fee and nearly instantaneous confirmation? Is that enough?

[02:48] What about protocol-level privacy and governance? How many cryptos fit those constraints?

[02:53] But some cryptos are on the other end of the spectrum. Consider the rather centralized Stellar and Ripple.

[02:58] Both Ripple and Stellar have top employees that are world economic forum agenda contributors. Both Ripple and Stellar proactively court nation-state regimes and central banks to

[03:08] support their CBDC efforts. And both Ripple and Stellar are actively working with nation-state regimes and central banks

[03:15] to develop and test their CBDCs. Clearly cryptos are not equal.

[03:20] Use of the term and blanket support for "crypto" is a disservice to those of us who want to see a real change to the statist quo.

[03:27] What term or phrase should be used to distinguish the cryptos that are most empowering to the individual?

[03:32] What would be succinct and understandable? Your thoughts and suggestions are welcomed and encouraged.

[03:38] But even if we identify a compelling framing, will it be enough? We've seen that features, privacy, speed, and idealistic ends do not guarantee success.

[03:45] If one's favorite crypto is not accepted, then what? Adoption is paramount.

[03:50] As one Redditor astutely pointed out, markets are driven by narratives. So the question becomes, how can we see more adoption of the cryptos on this end of the

[03:58] spectrum if the powers that be can, through their friends in the mainstream media, shape the narrative to favor themselves?

[04:05] That's a tough question to answer. Certainly it won't come from each of us being silent and doing nothing.

[04:10] And it won't come from each of us being reactionary, merely protesting against what we do not like.

[04:14] It will depend on each of us acting, using precise language and building, and offering a counter-narrative, a more compelling narrative, one that doesn't just proclaim that such

[04:23] and such a crypto is better than another crypto, but that positions the superior crypto against its real competition, CBDCs, that makes clear what is at stake.

[04:33] Perhaps then, as more CBDCs are piloted and rolled out, we'll see more individuals looking for an alternative that works.

[04:40] We need to be ready. We need to put our best foot forward.

[04:42] We need to observe, think, act, and repeat with precision. Good morning, good day, welcome to Incubator Weekly, Rodrigo and Rion, how are you today?

[04:59] And did either of you find yourself during the newsreel thinking, yes, I've had that experience where someone asks me about crypto or whatever, and I just find myself wondering,

[05:08] wow, what is he thinking when he's asking me this, because yeah, there's different options out there.

[05:15] Yeah. Good morning.

[05:17] The one thing that I was thinking through the newsreel was how the term crypto and Bitcoin and how crypto, using the term crypto, does us a disservice.

[05:31] It's a tricky thing because, you know, we also want to differentiate ourselves against Bitcoin, and it's very difficult to do that with just one project.

[05:41] So it does kind of help in some ways when you say, you know, crypto instead of Bitcoin, and that's the whole narrative.

[05:48] But I understand the point that then you're lumping yourselves in with the Ripples and the XRPs of the world.

[05:54] And so it's. And the Terralunas.

[05:56] Yeah. Yeah.

[05:58] Rodrigo, what do you think? I was thinking, for example, the general public, they don't have a clue what it is one or another.

[06:13] So as governments push CBDCs and DLTs, they will bring attention for crypto. So the companies will start to invest on DLTs, on CBDCs and bring people to get to know what

[06:35] it is, blockchain and crypto. And therefore it will be inevitable that people will go to the right direction.

[06:44] But I also think that we cannot stop this movement from the government. And then the idea in my mind, it is, OK, how do I surf this wave in the right direction?

[07:00] Take the impulse of the government actions and CBDCs to generate inclusion, inclusion from the point of view of protection and also from the point of view of crypto adoption.

[07:14] Great. Well, that is a great jumping off point for our show today.

[07:20] Everybody, we are joined by the CEO of 88i to give you a thank you. Yes.

[07:28] Oh, yes. 88i back in, I think it was 2020.

[07:33] It was during a quarterly call from Dash Core Group. And I think they started talking about 88i during the business development portion of

[07:44] their call. Now, it was now 2024.

[07:50] Tell us what happened in 2020, how this introduction between you and I think someone in Dash Core Group even began.

[07:58] What has happened since? Why are you still here?

[08:01] Well, I am still here because I have a purpose in life. There is protected people, a billion people, by the way.

[08:09] So to protect over a billion people, we must build a global business. Because in Brazil, we have 200 million people, in Latin America, 600 million.

[08:22] In America, it's about over a billion. And in 2019, I was joining a project of Facebook Libra and developing for them a solution related

[08:38] to insurance for Libra. And the idea was on day one, reach 2.6 billion people on day one.

[08:45] So this is how the concept started at the beginning. And reach them with what?

[08:54] What was the product? By that time, well, my career life was in the financial sector between bank and insurance.

[09:05] And I had the opportunity to live in China, where the fintech phenomenon started back in 2006.

[09:14] I was a country manager of ERP, software operation for insurance in China. And then I saw the first digital company get born that was Zongam, invested by Pingyang

[09:25] Insurance, the world's largest insurance company worldwide, Ticent, that owns WeChat, and Alibaba with Alipay.

[09:34] Those are the investors of this first digital insurance company back that time. And they were distributing insurance correlated with the experience of super apps.

[09:50] What it is in a super app, a super app, it is a mix of WhatsApp, plus your bank account, plus Uber, plus Tinder, plus everything in just one single app.

[10:06] This is what we call a super app. And in the West, it doesn't exist anyone like it.

[10:12] There's those in China. But there is a competition, a gold race to become the super app, the dominant player

[10:19] in the West of the planet. In this race, there are three main pillars of the financial sector.

[10:29] One which is banking with investments, loans, and another one that is protection with insurance. Those are the financial pillars of the industry.

[10:42] So to become one super app, it's inevitable that you must have those services around your super app to become the dominant player.

[10:56] And making a proxy with Libra by the time, they were creating a crypto. But the thing for all cryptos or blockchains, it is adoption.

[11:08] How do we make adoption? And in the business case of ADI, we were mixing the vertical of trust, which is insurance,

[11:20] with the horizontal protocol of trust, which is blockchain. In this intersection, I see the perfect sweet spot for the business case with the technology.

[11:31] Then comparing this with super apps, how do we embed protection with the experience that you have with the apps that you consume on a daily basis, for example, fintechs, digital

[11:49] banks, or mobility with Uber, or delivery in your door, or e-commerce, for example. How do we embed protection in those experiences of consumption?

[12:04] Please ask any time if you want to, because I will keep going. >> I am wondering, when you were seeking how to answer these questions that you are currently

[12:15] asking, did you stumble onto Dash? Did you talk to someone there?

[12:20] Did someone call you and say, how can we help you? >> It worked like this, in 2018, I first developed on Ethereum, like everybody else.

[12:37] Because at the end of '17 to '18, it was the all-time high, the bubble of ICOs, everything was happening at the same time.

[12:49] We have a slang saying, the cost of the sauce was heavier than the cost of the chicken. To pay the register of the transaction as a gas fee was higher than the cost of the

[13:04] policy itself, so it doesn't make sense to continue to use this network. >> That's insane.

[13:11] >> Then we experimented a number of different things, and the guy that was the ambassador was Rodrigo from Dash.

[13:36] Because he was a YouTuber creating content around Dash, acting as an ambassador, joining all the events related to crypto, this is how we met.

[13:49] As an ambassador, passionate about it, he was talking that Dash have the proof of work with the miners and the proof of stake with the masternodes.

[14:04] In between this mix, he and I, as an insurer, we could be one masternode, and therefore settle transactions that we put it on the chain.

[14:16] Another way of saying, I could instant pay the claims of insurance policies that I issue in the chain.

[14:29] Because as a trustee, for example, and with the stake there, if I miss pay the transactions, for example, I would be punished with my own reserve funds.

[14:46] So this would guarantee that I would act as I should get operated in the market. >> Let's fast forward a little bit then.

[14:55] So you've spoken with Rodrigo, you've told him what you need. You told him that you're experimenting on Ethereum and found yourself paying more in

[15:03] gas fees than literally the policies were even worth. >> Insurance policies, I don't know if everybody knows the line of business that he's in yet.

[15:12] It's insurance policies at a small level. >> Yeah.

[15:16] Like, okay. Like micro insurance, maybe we could call it that.

[15:21] >> I would say nano insurance. >> Nano insurance.

[15:24] Gorgeous. >> Nano insurance.

[15:26] Because... >> Why stop there?

[15:28] Pico insurance. Femto insurance.

[15:30] Messing. >> Not Fenton, because it would give a perception of something hidden.

[15:39] Nothing hidden. It's transparent.

[15:41] >> Right. So then what -- so he -- you decided, yes, this sounds like it could be a potential solution.

[15:53] Then what happened? Why don't we have 88-I insurance policies on Dash today?

[15:59] Why? Because Dash was updating the code.

[16:06] The initial idea was to build smart contracts on top of it. And Dash has more a characteristic of digital cash instead of building smart contracts.

[16:18] So this was -- it's not on Dash yet. But so far.

[16:25] We started as an initial tech. And this means a tech company that provides services for the insurance industry.

[16:33] But throughout the journey, we managed to become an insurance carrier in Brazil, a formal one authorized by the government.

[16:41] Then we became a financial regulated institution here. And then we now have the control of the value chain.

[16:50] We are able to design products that doesn't exist in the market, for example, based on kilometers, based on a trip, a single trip, based on minutes, instead of an annual policy.

[17:06] And we evolved the concept of user-based insurance from on-demand that you have to think, okay, I'm going to start now.

[17:16] And I have to remember to finish my insurance. To adjusting time insurance.

[17:23] So this means you gave me the access to your app, for example, or APIs. And then I turn it on and off in realtime your insurance for you.

[17:37] So nobody wants to think about insurance. It's awful.

[17:44] But everybody wants to stay protected. So you allow me to have the access to your information to protect you in realtime.

[17:52] This is way more inclusive. This is super transparent.

[17:57] Because you see, okay, this time I do remember I took a Uber trip, for example. I do remember.

[18:03] And I have this protection that turn on when you take the ride and when you finish the ride, finish the insurance itself.

[18:13] I have a question about what the value proposition is for your company to be building on blockchain technologies, whether that was in your mind, Ethereum to begin with and now Dash.

[18:28] And as I spoke with you earlier, there were several others that you looked into as well. But from the business standpoint, why not just use a normal database to store your insurance

[18:39] policies? Why store insurance policies on a blockchain?

[18:47] Awesome question. So when we started, we started using a cloud-based system built on AWS.

[18:57] So this is our current tech stack today. So just one sec to turn off the one call.

[19:03] Busy man. It's a high quality phone.

[19:08] And just one sec. So right.

[19:17] So I'm sorry. Turn it off here.

[19:22] So when, when, please help me with the question again, because I got this. Why put your business on a blockchain instead of a standard database?

[19:33] So I started as AWS cloud-based as, let's say, an advanced tech shooter, and to be able to protect a billion people, I cannot constrain myself in the regulation of a single market.

[19:52] So to surpass a regulation or central banks, we would have to escape this chain that, this bank chain, let's say, this bank chain that doesn't allow us to, to do the right thing

[20:11] to protect people to a blockchain. Therefore I would escape the regulations because instead of being a formal insurance carrier,

[20:21] it will be much more like a cooperative where, where people share the risks in the net, for example, digitally in this new environment of Web3 that is not regulated so far.

[20:37] But meanwhile, it is also transparent. It's public.

[20:42] It's permissionless. And so we first received the authorization here in Brazil to become a formal insurance

[20:54] and then develop products for this because traditional carriers doesn't want to develop those kinds of products or crypto products, for example.

[21:05] They are too scary. They don't want to go in this direction.

[21:10] As a formal carrier, I can develop, but once I have the blockchain technology, I can escape the regulations of my own country and then limit this potential to just 200 million people

[21:23] in Brazil and go global, and then protect over a billion, which is my mission in life. So that's why this is fun to hear a real corporate business type say, I'm interested in blockchain

[21:36] because I think I can make more money with it. Because so often, you know, the pitch that people that I've heard people, you know, take

[21:44] to businesses is, well, don't you just want to be cool or don't you just want to like get into some blockchain because it's cool or because it's the right thing to do or it's

[21:54] technologically advanced, blah, blah, blah, but you're saying, OK, those things may be true.

[22:00] But also, I think I can make more money and like actually a lot more money using it for my business.

[22:06] This is the I didn't say this directly, but yes, indirectly, this is what it is. But the thing is, OK, first of all, I can protect people globally that are excluded

[22:22] of protection, gig workers, Uber drivers, for example, just one example. But there is a number of people that works from now.

[22:31] They are not employees, neither contractors. So the industry, the formal industry doesn't have a protection design for this public.

[22:42] And then I can offer them a protection. And then I already proved the business case here in Brazil that we'll show you.

[22:50] And the same customer that I have here, Uber, by the way, they operate worldwide. So why not?

[22:59] I can protect people, I can include them in the financial system and meanwhile make money with this.

[23:05] Why not? Yeah.

[23:07] So you mentioned several times escaping regulations. And I know that you're an established corporation.

[23:14] So I'm sure that it can't be anything that, you know, you would be you'd be putting your company in jeopardy for.

[23:21] But what exactly do you mean by escaping having putting data on blockchains and maybe payments on blockchains?

[23:28] How does that escape regulations? And I think Amanda's extension of that was how does that then, you know, obviously, when

[23:35] you escape regulations, that is a way to make more money. And I think that was Amanda's connection.

[23:41] But yeah. Can you just expand on?

[23:43] Yeah. There is a very subtle difference between what is legal, what is illegal.

[23:54] We are talking about legal, everything legal, but not regulated. Gotcha.

[23:59] It's kind of like Uber did as well, because Uber is one of your main clients, as I understand. And they they did this little dance as well, where, you know, they they're just offering

[24:09] people rides and it shouldn't be illegal. And but there was this gray area of whether it was regulated and whether they were they

[24:18] were escaping regulation. So it sounds like you're kind of going down the same track of saying, hey, more or less,

[24:24] I would say so, because there, for example, there was a monopoly between the taxi drivers and with with with their license.

[24:38] So it was a monopoly, yeah, or an oligopoly by city state. OK, and when they broke this, they did provide more rights for people that wasn't consuming

[24:52] taxi rides and they started to consume more rights in a ride hailing services. So it became a reality worldwide here, for example, with insurance.

[25:06] We have traditional insurance policies. So if you go to a traditional carrier, you would buy a annual policy, for example.

[25:16] With me, you would buy a non-policy just for one risk, one ride, for example, or one delivery service or one transaction in your wallet.

[25:31] So I have insurance for ride. I have insurance for delivery and I have insurance for financial transactions as well for the

[25:40] traditional risks, for example, your bank account, your credit card and your debit card. And we are evolving these products to protect your financial assets as well.

[25:51] So if I say financial assets, what is the difference between a crypto asset or an NFT asset?

[25:59] An NFT could represent a share of your house, an investment, could be a piece of art, could be anything, a digital asset.

[26:10] And this would be just an additional cover on top of a digital wallet insurance, a traditional digital wallet insurance, a formal one.

[26:20] I can test this in Brazil and see if it works right in a regulated standpoint. To then be vote this to only Web 3.0 risk.

[26:34] If it is only Web 3.0 that is not regulated, it's global natively on day zero because it's a Web 3.0 risk and there is no regulation around insurance worldwide for this.

[26:49] So I would prove the concept, scale it, go global. So one of the things that I wanted to mention today, I know personally, I am a voluntarist.

[27:02] I think that everything should be voluntary. Some people would call that libertarian or even an anarchist.

[27:12] And I know that we also have a lot of those types in our community. And if anybody hasn't done the deep research about like strategies to actually developing

[27:24] a libertarian or just a liberty minded world where there are fewer regulations, you come across things that sound a lot like, well, insurance companies would cover what the government

[27:36] is currently doing. It would be whatever the government's doing, judicial services and all those protection

[27:45] services that they say they're giving us in a free market, a fully free market. Those would be covered by insurance.

[27:53] So that is the business that you're in. So I think sometimes people have a bad preconceived notion of what insurance is because of our

[28:07] current experiences with insurance companies that they're mandated and all that stuff. But your product is so not only can your product and your industry take some of those services

[28:20] that government is offering and provide them better. But as far as I understand, all of your insurance target markets are catered towards voluntary,

[28:30] like somebody gets in an Uber and they want to protect themselves on that trip or on the other side of the Uber driver, like the Uber driver, he wants to protect his income.

[28:42] So just kind of give us an idea of, you're trying to provide voluntary micro insurance to people that want them, right?

[28:55] Can you tell us a little bit about your business acquisition? I know that this is the last kind of business question that I had.

[29:03] I do want to get into more of the technical stuff as well. But can you describe your industry in terms of like, you know, these are voluntary policies

[29:14] that people are picking up. Is that correct?

[29:16] Can you see my screen with Uber? Yes, we can.

[29:21] So I will talk this Uber case to materialize and then go to the business and strategy. So you would have an example on your mind.

[29:32] So in this case here, Uber, it is a customer of ADI in Brazil. So the driver receives a push message inside the Uber driver app.

[29:46] And this message says you can contract your income protection insurance. You would protect your gains and it's super easy to start.

[30:01] So when you click here, we have two different marketing campaigns. So this one from now on, you can protect your gains while driving with Uber.

[30:13] It would cost you less than two pennies, 1.7 Brazilian penny real per kilometer. And you would protect your income up to 15 days and you protect it right away.

[30:29] This represents around $800, which is 3,900 Brazilian reais, protecting up to 15 days, 24 hours.

[30:41] It is super fast. Click it here to hire.

[30:46] Then when you click this to get more information, you are redirected from this marketing campaign to insurance products inside the insurance wallet in Uber driver app.

[31:00] Then clicking on the insurance income protection, you have the terms and conditions. You just scroll down and you always have this fluctuating button to activate it.

[31:12] And then when you register, we issue the policy instantly. We don't require to fill any blank because all the personal information is collected

[31:21] inside this logged environment of Uber driver app. And neither we ask for any type of a payment here.

[31:29] Because when you finish a ride and pay this ride as a passenger, there is a split between the Uber platform and the driver of the payment.

[31:42] And in this moment, we collected premium of insurance at the source of revenue. So there is no fall of any payment.

[31:54] And then we can charge per kilometer per ride. This policy, it is issued instantly.

[32:02] The driver would receive via email that is inside of the Uber driver app, the same email. And also they can verify the policy inside the app.

[32:15] To give you an idea, in six months, we surpassed 30,000 monthly insurance policies here. This means 30,000 drivers, over 30,000 drivers that now have the protection in a daily basis.

[32:30] We protect their moving six months daily income. In case of an accident, we pay them back their daily income up to 15 days.

[32:44] This is what it is, this case of income protection for Uber. >> Yeah.

[32:51] Yeah. We're glad that you answered that.

[32:53] Because we did have a question that was asking, what is this protecting? I think you just answered that question.

[32:59] >> Okay. >> So -- and that -- just so people know, like, that's not some marketing plot or --

[33:06] >> Right. That looks like -- that was historical data, not like, this is what we hope to be able

[33:13] to do. [ Laughter ]

[33:15] >> Yes. >> Yeah.

[33:17] >> So, okay. So, I feel two things.

[33:19] I feel sad that no other blockchain has been able to fully onboard 88i so far, even though you've known for years that you want that solution.

[33:30] And at the same time, I feel so happy that that means that Dash still has a chance to onboard 88i.

[33:36] So what remains to be done? Is this a platform thing?

[33:42] Is this a can we get started now thing? Maybe this is a question for you, Rion.

[33:46] Like, how can we solve Rodrigo's problems, like, as soon as humanly possible? >> Yeah.

[33:53] And we talked about this in our previous call. So I asked Rodrigo, and you can kind of correct me and add to this as well, Rodrigo, after.

[34:02] But I wanted to know, what exactly do you want to store on a blockchain? Like, what kind of data is this?

[34:08] And he was mentioning policy numbers, coverage values, and triggers to settle a policy. So like, when an Uber drive is done, for example, that triggers the policy, something along

[34:22] those lines. So expound upon that, Rodrigo.

[34:25] >> So we are capturing information in real time from our customers insured by 88i. And with this information, instead of this friction to settle a claim, asking for documents

[34:49] in paper that takes a while, for example, to make the adjustment process, what we have here as a vision, it is that we could evolve insurance products into parametric products.

[35:06] This means instead of asking you for a police report, for example, I could gather your geolocation and g-forces of impact, for example, from your car or from your Uber app.

[35:21] And therefore, I can not just turn on and off the insurance in real time, but I can also pull the triggers of the adjustment of the same insurance policy in real time.

[35:36] And therefore, I could remove this friction of insurance adjustments that takes a month to settle a claim, to settle the claim instantly in real time.

[35:52] Because the information would be provided also in real time. And the triggers to settle the claim perceived in real time.

[36:01] So this changed the whole experience of the customer with insurance. That's why smart contracts, or triggers that I can have used these super apps as oracles

[36:17] of information. And because Dash has this characteristic of being a super fast network, cheap network,

[36:29] this would enable me to perform the nano insurance policies with a low cost and super fast payouts. Does that answer the question, right?

[36:47] I think so. And I was also, there was some follow up questioning in the chat about insurance, like what this

[36:57] is actually doing in this specific case of Uber insurance. Are you protecting against in this case, like Uber not paying your income?

[37:08] Or is it more like, maybe nobody's requesting rides for a week for some reason. And I'm-

[37:17] In this case, it's specifically saying, we started with personal accident insurance. Personal accident.

[37:25] So in this case, technically saying, it is a temporary disability due to a personal accident. In this case, you are unable to drive.

[37:38] And because you are unable to drive, I would pay out your daily income. As a gig worker, you have your moving average income in six months.

[37:50] And if you suffer any type of disruption because of a personal accident, instantly, I would pay out your daily income up to 15 days.

[38:01] Gotcha. Okay.

[38:03] Now, I have a- But this is just the first case.

[38:05] Okay? We have other cases.

[38:07] We also launched with Uber in Brazil, at Uber Flash, last mile delivery for passengers. And we can continue to add protections, for example, related to a disease, related to

[38:21] a car issue. So each type of a risk has a different type of adjustment to settle the claim.

[38:29] So that's why we are going one by one. This is the example that I showed you.

[38:34] Personal income protection, it is related to a personal accident, a temporary disability. Yeah.

[38:41] So obviously, you're getting policy, there's demand for these policies. So it's something that the market already wants.

[38:48] So on a more technical level, right now, you mentioned that you're storing data in AWS. And would the process be, "Hey, let's take that data that's currently stored in AWS,

[39:01] and let's put it on Dash platform." And this is obviously structured data.

[39:06] So it's not something that you can just shove into an op return on a blockchain. So this definitely sounds like something that's well-suited for Dash platform, which is exactly

[39:16] that. It's data that is structured, and that can be queried, and automation can be done against

[39:26] that data. This is cryptographically secured data.

[39:30] So you can prove, if you combine that with identities, you can prove that ADAI did in fact, issue this insurance policy to me, in this levels, it covers this scenario.

[39:46] And I can then prove, maybe even in the traditional legal system, ADAI owes me money. And so these could be in fact, legally enforceable documents, as far as I understand.

[40:02] The law shouldn't care that this is stored on AWS versus the blockchain. So I would guess that this is just providing extra assurances for both ADAI and the people

[40:20] insured that this is provable data. Yes, I will answer this right away, but not just the proof of insurance, but this would

[40:31] improve the customer experience, compared to the traditional insurance market today. Because instead of waiting a long time, over a month to receive the payout of a claim,

[40:43] we would have this shortening, ultimately to instant payout. So what kind of information we're putting in the chain?

[40:52] The policy number, for sure. When the policy was issued, this means when the insurance is started, and when the insurance

[41:00] ends. Because when we are talking about insurance per kilometer or per minute in a delivery,

[41:07] for example, it's super important to verify when it started, when it ends, when you were protected, and when you're not.

[41:17] And this is transparent to everybody, it's public, it is auditable. Then you could make sure this time you're protected, this time you're not.

[41:31] And then the information is related to the specific type of risk itself, because this means the triggers that we would pull from the super apps as oracles to settle the claim.

[41:44] So let's say I have an accident, so I have geolocation and g-forces of impact. So those could be, for example, triggers that I pull from the super app.

[41:56] And then I can publicly say, OK, this policy had a claim, and then I did owe money to Rion as a customer for you, I have to pay out.

[42:13] Without revealing your personal data, the information about the insurance itself, type of a risk, and your policy number, this will be the kind of information stored in the chain.

[42:25] Now, in our last conversation, we talked about, and I'm looking at my whiteboard because I wrote some notes down, we talked about your experience and your history of the Brazilian

[42:38] economy and what that's done. So I don't know, we don't want to spend too much time on this, but I did want to, we talked

[42:46] about the PIX system. Can you explain that?

[42:51] Because when you were talking about doing payouts, my mind immediately was thinking about, OK, not only are you interested in doing data storage on a blockchain, but you

[43:02] might be doing payouts automatically. And I don't think that that's paying out in Dash.

[43:11] But we talked about how you might want to be integrated into the PIX system. So maybe you could just give an overview of what PIX is in Brazil and talk about how you

[43:24] might be wanting to integrate this in a fully automated way. OK.

[43:30] OK, so that's why also my comments related to CBDCs, because at the very beginning, if you take a look here in Brazil, we have an embryo of a CBDC that we call it PIX.

[43:56] The PIX, it is an instant payment method that started in 2019. Today, over 70% of the Brazilian population uses it on a daily basis.

[44:11] We are talking about dozens of a billion transactions in a monthly basis. The whole economy utilized.

[44:23] So super wide adoption. And this represents, for example, it ultimately even daily consumptions of a popcorn in the

[44:35] street are paid in PIX because they are free and they work 24/7. So that's how they started in this journey to establish a CBDC.

[44:49] I would make a short parallel with the creation of the Brazilian Real. Before creating the Brazilian Real, we had hyperinflation in Brazil, and then we created

[45:01] a breach to a new currency that we called URV, unit of a value. And this URV, unit of a value, it was pegged to the U.S. dollar.

[45:16] So therefore, people would stop the hyperinflation with the previous currency. Nobody trusted because everybody was pricing in U.S. dollars.

[45:31] Then we create this breach back to the U.S. dollar. Everybody gained trust for a period of time to adapt to a new currency.

[45:42] And then finally, in January of 1994, we changed the currency into Brazilian Real. And with this phenomenon, everybody adopted a new currency, created trust, and still is

[46:00] up to date. So what the government is doing now to implement a CBDC, they started with instant payment

[46:08] methods, PIX. They achieve over 70% adoption of the population, utilizing in a daily basis to buy popcorn

[46:16] in the street. Then once they substitute instant payment methods into a cashless society using QR codes,

[46:27] as it is from China, Fintech examples, back there in 2006 when I was talking, they evolved this to a series of payments, like substituting 12 installments via invoices.

[46:49] So now you can program to do a series of payments or invoices with PIX as well. Then they evolved this, the substitution of the invoices to substitute credit cards.

[47:05] And if you commit yourself to do 12 installments, when they were substituting invoices, you had to authorize each one of them to do the payment.

[47:16] But now, substituting credit cards, they would consume the limit of your bank account as your credit in the bank account, for example.

[47:26] Like the credit card, you do have a limit. In this case, they would consume the limit of your bank account.

[47:34] Substituting credit cards. And then they would evolve to international PIX, transacting, for example, the same technology

[47:43] that we are using here in Brazil. It is now being exported to BIS in Europe, to United States via Fed now, in several other

[47:53] countries in Latin America, Colombia, and Mexico, for example. They are utilizing the Brazilian technology for CBDCs because different than Chinese technology

[48:05] that creates retail CBDC, in Brazil, we create a wholesale CBDC. What is the difference?

[48:17] In the case of a retail CBDC, each individual has a bank account in the Chinese central bank.

[48:23] And then total surveillance. In this case of wholesale CBDC in Brazil, the commercial banks is still relevant.

[48:31] They are the issues of the CBDCs. And then there is a layer in between the central bank and the citizen to protect your data

[48:41] and the surveillance of the government because the issues are the commercial banks. And because the current financial ecosystem is still relevant, this was the model exported

[48:53] to Europe, United States, and Latin America with the Brazilian technology of a wholesale CBDC.

[49:00] Okay, then going forward in the presentation, if you could put it back there, we are looking, for example, to smart home ecosystem via telecom companies, last mile delivery companies, could

[49:20] be Amazon here to give you an idea that Logis is a Brazilian company, or smart transport with Uber.

[49:26] Those are customers that we already have in the ecosystems here. Then today we have contracts celebrated digitally, not in paper, but it's not a smart insurance

[49:41] policy yet. We could build it and trigger the claim to settle instantly via smart contract.

[49:48] So this is another thing. About the consensus method, with Dash, we have both proof of work and stake.

[49:59] With Peaks in Brazil, they are building on top of hyperledger bezel. So the use in this DLT, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, and we also experimented Hedera Hashgraph

[50:13] as a deck for fast transactions and low cost transactions as well. Seeing the network for us, Fullnode would be the regulator of insurance.

[50:26] The players, those are, for example, the distribution ecosystems as Uber in a B2C form of a distribution. Insurance companies, reinsurance companies, insurance companies, those are the players

[50:47] of this insurance chain. The customer itself as a lightweight node with their app consuming information of their

[50:57] own policy, their own protection, for example. Then we have this difference between what it is, a blockchain, what it is a DAG, and

[51:06] what we have experimented so far. So in this mobility ecosystem, we have here the platform, Uber, the driver, and the rider.

[51:19] We are talking about different types of protection, could be related to commerce, consumer electronics, travel of people and/or goods, life, health, and well-being, financial services or digital

[51:32] wallet protection, and property related to auto and home, distributed via super apps. And then connected with them via APIs, we would receive from these exclusive private

[51:47] sources of information, high frequency, high volume, and high granularity of information that enable us to perceive better the risk, and therefore price better the policy, excluding

[52:02] fraud, for example, being more inclusive. And going down, talking about the ecosystem in Brazil, here we have an ecosystem of transport,

[52:16] people and goods, here in white, life, health, and well-being, and here we have property, for example, in green, we have the layer underneath with transactions and payments of banking.

[52:33] Then we have fintechs, banking as a service, and the regulatory sandbox that allow fintech companies to become banks in Brazil, digital banks.

[52:45] On blue, we have the insurance underneath those ecosystems as well, that allow insurtechs as ANSI to become via regulatory sandbox a formal insurance carrier.

[52:59] And then we also have mobiliary values as SEC, for example, in Brazil we call it CDM, that allowed tech companies to tokenize the economy, or mobiliary values as well.

[53:14] And then they created a regulatory sandbox to make these exchanges, crypto companies in Brazil, tokenization companies here, to become financial regulated institutions in

[53:32] the country. So with all those systems connected, it will come also health, it will come energy, it

[53:42] will come a number of other things, we would have the open data environment to leverage the economy, to create more inclusion, and to develop each one of the citizens in the

[53:58] country. So this is what is happening from the regulatory perspective here, and that's why I see this

[54:06] synergy between CBDC and crypto to spread adoption. Yeah, a lot to take in there with those slides, and if people want to, you know, just pause

[54:20] and stop and zoom in on certain parts of that, I'm sure they're welcome to. I don't pretend to understand everything about your business, but it sounds like you've got

[54:30] a big plan, big vision. I wanted to ask, I know that you mentioned you had one hour for the call, and we're getting

[54:37] close to that, about five minutes left. I wanted to ask kind of an off-the-wall question to make this whole concept of insurance and

[54:46] micro-insurance a little bit more tangible to our audience. And I want to ask a question, I want to ask something like, I don't have any specific

[54:56] need to, I'm not an Uber driver, I don't need that specific service, but could you see this evolving into something where, for example, we have something called the Maya protocol.

[55:10] It's a decentralized exchange. And one of the biggest risks of using a decentralized exchange versus just like holding your own

[55:20] keys is, let's say, Maya has a service that's called savers, where you put your dash on the Maya protocol, and then it acts to help facilitate liquidity provision and facilitate

[55:35] swaps and things like that. But from the user's perspective, what it does is it gives you a yield on your dash, but

[55:42] you have to give it to them. And one of the biggest risks is that there's some kind of a technical problem or even like

[55:51] a rug pull where they don't give it back when you request it. Is 88i something that may break into that kind of a service offering where I could say,

[56:05] "Hey, I'm going to deposit my dash to get a yield on Maya protocol, but I want that insured and I'll pay 50 cents or half of a percent or something to have that insured

[56:21] so that if Maya doesn't pay me back and I can prove that I sent the dash there and I requested it back and I didn't get it paid back within a certain time frame."

[56:31] Is that something that 88i plans to cater to? Is that -- it's not like I'm not asking necessarily if you're going to do that, but --

[56:45] Is it possible? Is that kind of the thing that is possible with the technology that you're building?

[56:51] Definitely it is possible. So in insurance, we are talking about theory of big numbers.

[56:59] So this means, for example, can I spread the risk? One.

[57:04] There will be adoption because if for one single case, there will be too expensive. So it might not make sense.

[57:14] But if there is adoption and we can spread the risk, pulverize the risk, therefore it makes sense for the cost because that will be cheaper.

[57:25] And how can -- the first question is, okay, how can I assure that we are not talking about protecting misbehavior?

[57:36] Because in this relation, you might have a conflict of interest because you wanted to embellish the claim to receive the payout.

[57:44] So how can I, as in the case that I talked with the super apps, use information that are transparent, auditable, public, with no conflict of interest in real time?

[58:00] If I have this situation, then, okay, I have an oracle that everybody trusts in this information. It is verifiable.

[58:10] There is no argument. If I'm trying to hold the assets on my side as a centralized company, or if you're trying

[58:20] to embellish the insurance, it's transparent to everybody. Then perfect.

[58:24] We can surely do an insurance there. >> Part of the question also is, do you have any services that offer insurance for anonymous

[58:37] people? Or is it all based on, okay, I have my government ID --

[58:41] >> This is a journey. No.

[58:44] The initial concept, it was, okay, how can I insure your wallet? So I don't need your government IT.

[58:55] And I don't want to have your company ID. But maybe a social login or a wallet login.

[59:02] Something that verifies that channel, that specific wallet, alias, avatar, whatever. But it must be verifiable.

[59:14] It is this one that contracted insurance, that it is protected. It is the same one that is claiming out, okay, and the transaction or the protection.

[59:25] We can settle the claim without the conflict of interest. If so, yes, we can do it.

[59:32] But in this journey, that's why I mentioned I started with traditional insurance policies. Digitalized them.

[59:40] Then creating adoption by shortening the lifespan of the policies for a public that is excluded today, gig workers.

[59:50] And I created the digital wallet insurance, evolving to digital assets. So we are touching the waters into Web 3.

[60:00] We can insure, for example, we are now analyzing for a bank, yield on trading, on leverage trading options in the stock market.

[60:13] Okay. It's just the same thing in crypto.

[60:16] So we are touching the waters, understanding the risk, understanding if there is conflict of interest or not.

[60:25] But this is something that I personally wanted to do for the Web 3. That's how we go global.

[60:32] But we must insure that it's transparent, verifiable, no conflict of interest, and we can settle in real time.

[60:40] If so, I'm there. Great.

[60:43] Well, that sounds like some pretty specific and I hope achievable requirements for a solution for 88i to move to the blockchain.

[60:55] Do you have any final comments, Rion? Yeah.

[60:59] So this is basically just the kickoff to working together with 88i and Rodrigo with the incubator. We'd like to help him build on Dash platform, whatever his business needs are.

[61:11] We don't question them. He has a business need.

[61:13] We just help with the technical solution. This was basically just the kickoff to show we have a real customer here who has a real

[61:20] business use case. Can we actually do this?

[61:25] And right now, the obvious answer is not yet. Dash platform is not on mainnet, and it's getting more stable on testnet.

[61:36] So that's what we want to test it with, and we will move into that as soon as we can with a stable testnet.

[61:43] So that's the plan, and we'll just do that as soon as we can. Well, that sounds great.

[61:48] Well, I really look forward to being updated along the process of crafting this solution. And thanks for joining us today, Rodrigo, and we look forward to talking to you again

[61:59] in the future. And I also wanted to thank each one of you, Rion, Amanda, and the Dash community.

[62:09] Also for the trust of DIF, because I am invested by DIF. So I wanted to thank the whole community for this.

[62:18] You are the ones who make it possible. Right on.

[62:22] Thanks for joining us, everybody. See you next time.

[62:24] All right. Bye.

[62:26] Bye-bye. Thank you.

[62:27] Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

[62:29] Bye. Bye.
