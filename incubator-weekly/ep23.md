[00:00] [MUSIC] At the core of crypto is code, mathematics.
[00:08] Developers, architects, and engineers use existing tools and languages and create anew to push the boundaries of this technology. And the world has been forever changed.
[00:17] Yet cryptocurrency, crypto's original use case, has not really taken hold. For many, crypto is something to speculate with, to hodl, not to use.
[00:26] To the great dismay of crypto pioneers, crypto has yet to supplant centralized mediums of exchange. There are many reasons for this, inertia being a big one.
[00:35] So too is crypto's accessibility, or lack thereof. My mom, for example, tried to use bitcoin and when I told her the address, she got scared.
[00:44] And she didn't want to send me money to this random looking stream. It looks like an alien language.
[00:48] Yeah. And so, you know, that turns off a lot of people.
[00:51] For most people, their current payment systems work pretty well. Is it reasonable, then, to expect mass adoption of crypto as currency?
[00:58] Indeed, it seems like many in crypto have gotten the message. Many of the old school cryptos, who used to proudly tout crypto's potential to "bank the unbanked," are today content to court legacy banks and their ilk.
[01:10] And almost no new entrant into the crypto space in recent years has put forth as its first function being a better medium of exchange than those offered by established centralized outfits. Still, some cryptocurrency advocates remain.
[01:22] They promote crypto, and usually a specific network, as a superior product to existing options. Usually, this is done by pointing to technological functionality.
[01:31] This network is faster than that network. This network is less expensive than that network.
[01:36] This network is more secure than that network. This network can scale more than that network, and on and on.
[01:42] And while all of that is important, it clearly is not, on its own, sufficient to attract widespread, day-to-day use. And that makes sense, especially in today's world, as most of us have been subjected to years of indoctrination via the mainstream, Prussian-based school curriculum,
[01:58] which omits helping students discover and cultivate critical thinking, the most powerful tool that could be in their toolbox, and instead instructs obedience to claimed authority and regurgitation of information.
[02:09] The result? Many tend not to rely on logic to operate, but look to and to favor what sounds good, what speaks to them, emotionally. Might this be a market signal that we in the cryptosphere, who are pushing for cryptocurrency, need heed?
[02:23] Do we do ourselves and our networks a disservice when we omit from our conversation this appeal to emotion? "Wait a minute," you decry. "Am I suggesting that we employ a logical fallacy?"
[02:34] Well, yes, and no. Appeal to emotion is indeed considered a logical fallacy, but only when it is disingenuous, when it is used to shield or circumvent truisms.
[02:44] But an appeal to emotion can be used, and it is not considered a logical fallacy, when it is congruent with facts. I am arguing against the use of an appeal to emotion that is manipulative.
[02:55] I am arguing for the use of an appeal to emotion that is aligned with truth. Such framing would resonate with both brain hemispheres, that which favors emotion,
[03:04] and which has been largely overlooked by cryptocurrency advocates, as well as that which favors logic. You see, we can couch our language, our outreach, our marketing, in emotion.
[03:15] It does not mean we are being dishonest. It merely means that we are using another means. A means that relies not on hard data or on lexicon coined by developers.
[03:25] It's a means that speaks to individuals, to their hearts, to their intuition. Anecdotally, it was an appeal to emotion that was, for me, the biggest hook of cryptocurrency.
[03:35] I saw it as a way to help improve the world. By using crypto, rather than the regime-backed currency where I happen to be born,
[03:41] I peacefully divest from destructive actions that I do not support, such as bombing people thousands of miles away that never harmed me or any of my neighbors.
[03:50] Further, I support a network that facilitates voluntary interactions. Cryptocurrency provides an alternative, an option, a medium of exchange that can empower each of us to be the change we wish to see.
[04:01] Might that appeal, emotionally, to others? [Music]
[04:17] That was a most righteous newsreel. I was just wondering, who wrote the script on that one?
[04:24] It always writes the scripts. Oh man, that one spoke to me, well, at an emotional level.
[04:33] That's why I came here, too. I would suspect this is why most of the people in Dash came to cryptocurrency.
[04:44] It's for not just the pump and the prospect of riches, but the prospect of creating a better world.
[05:01] And a new financial system that is, fair is not the right word, but at least just in some sense. And I hope that we can get there.
[05:17] It's going to be, I think, a rough road getting there. But it's something that I'm still very passionate about.
[05:26] And like the newsreel said, it doesn't matter. It does matter that we can scale, but none of these things matter until we scale.
[05:38] Until we actually get users that are interested in actually using cryptocurrency as money. So I think that we're laying the correct foundation, but I think that we somehow still need to crack that nut of how do we get users on board.
[05:58] And that is what I've been thinking about for years, and more specifically for several months, very deeply. Even questioning deeply held beliefs about our economics and things like that.
[06:13] Because that's where the rubber hits the road, is how you get actual users into your network. So thank you for that, Pete. I appreciate that one.
[06:27] Righteous. Well, as you've seen from the title today, we are having a quarterly report here at the Incubator.
[06:37] And as you see, we have all three strategists. And things are a little interesting today, because as you may recall, two of the three strategists did not request funding the last cycle.
[06:49] And in addition, Ash has a sort of unexpected announcement for us today. So without further ado, Rion, do you have any more opening comments than what you've given, or shall we jump right in?
[07:01] Okay. Tim, will you kick us off? Sure. So I have fully successfully depleted my funds.
[07:12] Congratulations. Thanks. So I have a nominal amount left that is, I mean, basically it's there because I couldn't afford to pay anything else off and support the admin behind it.
[07:29] But what we did accomplish was building out the decentralized dash application infrastructure, which we talked about a couple of months ago now. And it's an SDK that makes, kind of going back to the accessibility of cryptocurrency, it makes utilizing platform for what it's good for.
[07:57] So the reference to stored contracts and the reference to pieces held in the on-chain cloud using specifically IPFS. And so that those pieces can be utilized within a decentralized application that you built utilizing dash platform.
[08:18] So we wrapped up that, the base components, and then there's a how-to guide that is more agnostic developer friendly. So those who haven't much experience within blockchain or haven't much experience writing smart contracts with a bit of a starter package.
[08:38] And then the other one that we spent a lot of time finishing up is the goal challenge, which is a reference that really for allowing you to have a use for dash. And the basic thought is that we, as humans, we just do better when we have a wager in place at setting goals and keeping those goals than when there is no other accountability.
[09:03] And so it's a place to wage your dash against yourself to accomplish a goal along with others. And if you reach the goal, then you get your dash back.
[09:14] And if you don't, then that goes into a pool that goes out to those who succeeded. So if you wager and lose, then you go to the organization of your choosing, as long as you set that up.
[09:33] I have, Tim, do you want me to share the list of projects that you funded this quarter visually or are you? If you haven't pulled up, that's fine.
[09:45] Yeah, there were some. Are you seeing it now?
[09:49] We can see it. Okay.
[09:53] So if you wanted to cover any of this that you didn't cover before, it's like the dash made assistance. I'm not sure who's typing, but maybe you can mute yourself.
[10:07] That's the loudest typing I have ever heard. It's a mechanical keyboard, sounds like.
[10:13] Can you guys hear me right now? Yes.
[10:15] Okay. So it's not actually using my proper mic.
[10:19] It's using my webcam mic, so I just need to fix that. And that's why things were not working.
[10:24] I apologize to you guys and the audience. Let me fix this.
[10:27] No, it's okay. Apparently you're being productive.
[10:30] Okay. So, yeah, the dash made assistance was the most highly rewarded bounty on your side.
[10:39] Zoom in a bit if you can, Rion. And Mikhail.
[10:44] Yeah. Let's see.
[10:52] So if you wanted to talk about any of these other ones, go ahead. And if not, then we can, I guess, move on to our next.
[11:00] Okay. There's not much to say.
[11:02] Most of the funding for those were already approved claims before the, or were already made claims before the quarter roll. Gotcha.
[11:13] Or were claims that were already in process. So there was a number of QAs that were waiting final completion.
[11:18] Yeah. So this was at the very beginning of the quarter then, and even last quarter, but not yet paid out last quarter.
[11:25] Yep. So the dash made assistance is the work that has been doing for dash mate.
[11:31] And then there was a little bit that was, because he was doing that as an extension of DCG sponsored by the incubator. Okay.
[11:42] And I see that there was a typo here. So I'm just going to fix that real quick while you're talking.
[11:48] But yeah, go ahead. And if that's, if you had anything else to say on that, then go ahead.
[11:59] And if not, then we can move on to Ash, I guess. Is Ash next?
[12:04] Yes, he is. The finger of some announcement, but then we'll go over to Jim.
[12:12] Okay. So.
[12:16] All right. Let's hear from Ash.
[12:18] Okay. Yeah.
[12:20] Rion can move that spreadsheet again. I can just show everyone that.
[12:24] So I feel like I'm in sort of groundhog day. I'm saying the same stuff.
[12:29] As I said, last quarter, really much of a likeness focused really on supporting Maya through to its sort of completion. We've got dashes live.
[12:39] We've got the bonding. You can now bond dash towards quiddity nodes.
[12:43] You can deposit dash quiddity. You can trade dash.
[12:46] So that is largely complete. The last thing for that to sort of close off is any extra maintenance.
[12:53] But really, we're winding down on anything there. And the Maya team will be handling that going forwards, really.
[13:00] And the Genesis node, which was as part of to launch the network. There were a few whitelisted service providers, including Dash.
[13:08] And we were the hosts for that, having built the integration. And that Genesis node, now there are other nodes coming in to handle the whole quorum and feature set.
[13:18] The Genesis node will be spinning out. We're going to manually spin it out this month.
[13:22] They were going to automatically spin out at a certain tier, but we're just going to manually close this out this month. So that's Maya, I would largely say, is complete after maybe two and a half years, three years of 4Chain, Maya, everything like that.
[13:35] So that's good. We're on a decentralized exchange.
[13:37] Life's good. There's great things happening there.
[13:40] We've got streaming swap, so really low fee, lower fee than Binance or large centralized exchanges. There's going to be sufficient liquidity.
[13:49] They're going to connect to the 4Chain whole ecosystem. So you'll be able to go to end-to-end across that whole decentralized exchange, Tendermint-based platform.
[14:01] So yeah, just really good. Dash is now more accessible, less censorable.
[14:05] It's just a good place to be. I'm really glad to close off that project.
[14:09] It has been expensive. There's been a lot of funds gone into that, but I think it's a worthwhile expense.
[14:16] Waxing philosophical, I'm completely with what Rion said at the start there. The whole reason we got into this and why the incubator exists, whether it was initially to create platform apps and now more to become a Dash development powerhouse across all these different areas.
[14:32] I can see pieces falling into place, the decentralized application deployment system that Tim's been working on, the ability for developers to deploy their app without having to host it.
[14:43] They can deploy it to an IPFS. And that's, again, something where it's pinned and uncensorable, and it just makes this whole system more accessible.
[14:53] Yeah, and I'm just completely there with you. We've all been here for so long now, and the Dash community is one of the sort of oldest and most resilient to a degree.
[15:03] And we've all got different reasons, but there's a lot of a common theme towards sort of longer-term human goals and actual real value propositions beyond the sort of just get rich quick side of things. I think we're putting a lot of stuff in place towards that end.
[15:20] So the next thing on my list is the Dash Platform Explorer. I'm not sure if that's quite next on the list.
[15:28] Well, the Dash Pay extension is the next on the list, which is the actual sort of extension wallet, the MetaMask equivalent for Dash. Development's progressing well against that.
[15:39] We have a working sort of prototype now. We're kind of not at ground zero, but we've managed to get all the previous work functioning again.
[15:48] So everything is sort of at a good stage. There's been this sort of disconnect between how it was built and how Dash Platform has moved on.
[15:57] But the way it's built is actually more low-level. So we've got all the schemas there for the Dash Pay contract system.
[16:04] So all of this means that it's more efficient and faster. And whilst there are still some hang-ups from the SDK, which I know DCG are working on, that's progressing well.
[16:13] And hopefully we'll have that ready to launch in tandem with Platform and empower all these developers alongside the library for them as well. So, yeah, that's continuing well.
[16:22] The remainder of my funds will largely go towards that. There is the Platform Explorer next, which is just -- everyone's seen that.
[16:29] We've talked about that a lot. It's an insight or a blockchain explorer for Dash Platform.
[16:34] So you can view data contracts, DPNS users, everything like that. There's an interesting proposal now, guys.
[16:39] Shenmick has put a proposal in. He's been amazing to work with.
[16:43] Obviously I've worked with him. Tim's worked with him.
[16:45] He does phenomenal work. He works very hard.
[16:47] And everyone sort of has this sort of contact with him. And now he's proposing to become a strategist, which I'm really glad to see.
[16:55] He's a really good developer. He communicates really well.
[16:59] He has good, solid ideas. And as part of that, the likelihood is that he would then bring the Platform Explorer and take that over from me, which I'm more than happy to see.
[17:09] And I encourage the Dao to support him in this. And whatever weight my word holds, I thoroughly and completely support him in that.
[17:19] So hopefully he'll be with us the next time we do this call. So that was the next one on there.
[17:25] And then after that, you know, things are pretty small. You know, the reference platform extension is the same sort of thing, really, like parts of that platform extension and contributions to that.
[17:36] And the Provely Fair RNG game, what we wanted to do there is we just wanted to update it because it's been a couple of years. You know, there's been sort of quite a few shifts.
[17:45] And we wanted to just have a simple application that we can update as a good reference for RNG because we're getting some questions about how we can use BLS signatures as a source of entropy for random number generation. And that really covers the sort of incubator stuff for the last quarter.
[18:03] My next quarter, like I said, will be the DashPay extension, just really focusing down on that. I am limiting my incubator time just in case of efficiency.
[18:12] I don't have a proposal in the cycle. I have enough funds left over to, as long as I'm efficient and frugal with them, I can, you know, see this platform extension through.
[18:21] And the main thing I'm working on is that we're doing a Dash Direct clone, equivalent, I guess, and analog at CTX, which is called CTX Spend. We're almost done with it. We have as much merchant coverage as Dash Direct did, really, across the US.
[18:38] We've got plans to launch in Europe. We've got coverage already for Europe.
[18:42] We've got multiple different providers. We've got four backs.
[18:45] We've got the cash flow side sorted. We're largely done on the technical sense.
[18:49] There's just some legal work to do. So we're hoping to launch that in December.
[18:54] So stay tuned. And that will be, you know, the core focus of my next quarter alongside remaining incubator work.
[19:02] >> CTX Spend? >> Oh, yes.
[19:05] >> With greater coverage than Dash Direct. >> It's something where, you know, Marshall spoke to us, and he's been brilliant.
[19:13] He introduced us to all of his sort of contacts and providers and just onboarded us with them. They were really receptive.
[19:20] You know, he didn't want to necessarily leave the space, but it was the logical step for his business. So he was keen to support Dash having this feature set long term.
[19:32] So we've been working with, you know, Dash Core Group and with our providers that he introduced us to and with the technology to basically relaunch the same service to fill that sort of hole. Obviously, you know, we've got coin cards.
[19:44] We have, you know, bit refill and things. But this is just another good option.
[19:48] And this is more based on that sort of in-store sort of flow. So, yeah, we're hoping to launch that in December.
[19:54] Really good merchant coverage already sorted. Like this is largely complete.
[19:59] Maybe slightly premature announcing. I don't like to announce the announcement.
[20:03] We've had history of that before. But it is something where it's very soon.
[20:09] And I'm looking forward to releasing that. And then, Ash, so correct me if I'm wrong, but that's not only like a tool for Dash users to use, but doesn't the diff own some equity in CTX?
[20:23] Oh, yes. Yes, the diff owns 10% of CTX.
[20:26] So, yes, that is a, you know, everything on there will contribute and it's all in tandem. So, yeah, it's something where we're able to sort of add value that way.
[20:38] We will be trying to provide as much discount as we can. We may have to take somewhat different approaches with certain merchants just because of the nature of how our business is sort of set up.
[20:48] And somewhat a technical debt on, like, the Dash Direct side of how they previously built things. So we have to do things in a different approach, which is often better for the users.
[20:59] So whether that's, you know, upfront discounts or cashback rewards after the fact, that sort of thing. I don't want to detract too much from the incubator side of things, but I'm very excited about launching this project.
[21:11] And, yeah, it's something where it will be the similar sort of discounts, 5%, 7%, 12%, even in some cases potentially. And the next step following launch, which won't be, you know, I'm not going to get ahead of myself here.
[21:24] This is going to be maybe Q3/24, Q4/24 would be an actual card program. You know, we are working down those lines already, but those, you know, it's a compliance heavy process and that would have KYC.
[21:38] I'm going to be upfront straight away about that. We are not launching a card program without KYC. The actual gift card program does not have any KYC, but the Visa MasterCard program would have KYC.
[21:49] So I have a question about that. I know you don't want to talk too much about an incubator project, but it would be potentially a project that I would be interested in if you have an API or can expose it.
[22:01] We do. We do have an API we can expose right now. We're more likely to expose it privately to make it fully public just as we sort of walk before we run.
[22:10] But I'd be open to, yeah, I'd be happy to open it up to other incubator devs to work against, whether they're using that to issue rewards on their own platforms or they just want to embed the whole service
[22:22] within any existing systems they have. So, yeah. Okay, great. Well, that kind of, unless you had anything more to report there, that would be a good segue into what I'm working on.
[22:35] Let's do it. Let me bring up my screen again.
[22:41] And I'll switch this over to me now. I'm going to bump it down just one little notch here.
[22:56] Okay, so like Tim was saying, a lot of our expenses were actually very early on in the quarter, including the top two from my side of things, the merchant tools and the payment tools.
[23:13] These are ongoing projects that we've had for quite a while now. And I did explain, I should probably bring up Dash Central here as well while we're talking just so people can see my current proposal.
[23:33] Let me just clear up that I did early on, I said that we would have four proposals from the incubator. But it turns out that we're actually only going to have the two of us, my proposal and Mikhail's proposal.
[23:53] Ash, as he said, has sufficient funds and some other things that he's working on prioritizing. So he won't be requesting any this quarter and Tim won't be requesting.
[24:04] So I'll update this proposal. And let me just actually just I'll just show this instead of the actual spreadsheet, because this is the same information.
[24:17] And I'll go through the this is basically everything that I'm going to say is basically already said here. But the merchant tools, these are these are tools that that we're building so that merchants can very, very easily accept Dash payments and receive webhooks.
[24:39] So there are there is some overlap with existing tools such as any pay and whatnot. This is very much Dash focused and focused on creating the best, easiest, you know, script tag.
[24:52] Just insert the script tag into your website kind of experience and you'll get webhooks and things like this. We're building it with specific use cases in mind.
[25:02] AJ, who has been building it, does have some some services and some some businesses that one in particular, which is a cloud cloud service offering web hosting. And I'm not exactly sure what what services he'll offer, but he wants to accept Dash as payment.
[25:25] And so we're building this with that specific use case with an actual use case in mind. And then the payment tools are more more of the low level things, low level libraries that we built.
[25:39] And we we were mostly done with these tools last quarter, but we had to update them a little bit to support Maya transactions, which Eldorado is using under the hood. These these tools. So that was kind of early on in the quarter as well.
[26:01] Incubator updates. That's that's this program right here where we give updates on what we're working on. The modern vanilla web wallet. This is this is kind of the culmination of all the things that we've been building, at least from my side.
[26:18] And in my part of the incubator, we're building it into a web wallet that we'll have that we can then easily add all the features. And this is what I was talking about with Ash, where if and when Ash is ready to provide an API to whatever you were calling it, the Dash Direct Alternative.
[26:42] We'd love to integrate that right into our web wallet, and this would be eventually be able to be deployed as a mobile app or a desktop app or just a simple browser app. So that's one thing that we and it has our version of of usernames, which use existing tooling and existing.
[27:07] Yeah, existing standards rather than Dash Pay, which we could update and would update to support Dash Pay usernames when that lands, but we're actually. Pretty much done with providing usernames, Dash usernames at a local level rather than globally unique Dash usernames.
[27:26] And so that we hope to finish. And I think that we can finish that this quarter. And then these other things are fairly, fairly small, but I'll just talk about them briefly.
[27:40] Actually, I don't know if I need to talk about them too much because it's written right here in the proposal, what the remaining things were. But as you can see there, they're not too big of a expense on that side of things, so I think that pretty much wraps up my proposal or my.
[28:01] So. Great questions from anybody here in the call or from the audience, feel free to feel free to ask. OK, well, while we're potentially waiting for such a comment or question to come in.
[28:19] Or not, I just wanted to make a little comment of my own, which relates to the tone with which we started out today's show. Rion and then later Ash echoed that their main interest in being in Dash didn't their first their primary interest was not to get rich, so to speak.
[28:46] And I hear, of course, I've heard a lot of people in the community echo similar sentiments. And sometimes I feel kind of weird about myself because I'm thinking, dang, that actually is the main reason I'm here.
[29:03] But the more I've thought about it throughout this call, I just wanted to say that I think maybe my personal thoughts about it is just a different way of saying the same thing. And so I want to say this now in case you're like me and you've been like, oh, should I, you know, hide my motives?
[29:19] Should I not speak about them? But the different way of saying the same thing is that I, though my primary interest in Dash is to get rich, I do not want to get rich in dollars.
[29:35] Meaning I'm uninterested to sell Dash and oh, like, finally, I got rich in the dollars. I'm not interested to get rich in the euros, nor the rubles, nor any of the other legacy systems.
[29:50] My primary interest in getting rich in Dash is to get rich in Dash and with no interest in looping other currencies into that goal. So anyway, I don't know. I just wanted to say that.
[30:06] Let me back up a little bit because getting rich is a little bit of a loaded term, I guess. To me, it's all about two things, peace and prosperity.
[30:18] So peace is basically just like the ethical side of things. Like we want to we want to live in a world that promotes peace and not war.
[30:29] And then the prosperity, like who doesn't want to get rich? Like, I think we all want to be rich in terms of like goods and services.
[30:37] And I just wrap that up in the word prosperity. It's not about getting rich in terms of like, oh, I can like swim in my in my vault of gold coins like Scrooge McDuck kind of rich.
[30:50] It's like I just want to live in a prosperous, prosperous world. And I think everybody can agree with that.
[30:57] And we all know that our governmental fiat systems are not allowing us to prosper. And there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to build an economy that is prosperous,
[31:12] despite what's going on in some outside economy that we no longer have to live in. But we oftentimes choose to live in that despite having the ability to move away from it.
[31:26] So that's what that's my addendum, I guess, based on what you said as well, Amanda. So thanks for sharing those thoughts. Yeah.
[31:35] Right. For me, that's part of why the importance behind finding the multiple use cases for Dash. Because at the current state, if Dash is going to be a source of income for you,
[31:52] your most viable option is to then turn it into some kind of fiat that you can then buy groceries or pay rent or purchase utilities with. And the closer we can get to being able to buy your groceries with Dash or purchase your dog walking service
[32:07] or pay someone to help clean your house with these currencies, the further down that road we get of pulling ourselves off of the fiat government system
[32:18] and into not private in the sense of a walled garden private, but private in the sense of it's not influenced by policy or not controlled by policy and not controlled by bureaucrats.
[32:30] So we can pull ourselves off that fiat public system into a private system, an open private system, but a private system nonetheless. Amen.
[32:43] OK, well, we hope you have taken value from this report today. And thanks, strategists, for saying what you said.
[32:54] It's been a fun day of unexpected things. And, yeah, I guess we'll talk to you all next week.
[33:03] Later, everyone. Bye, everyone. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
