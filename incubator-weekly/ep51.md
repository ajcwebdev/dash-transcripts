[00:00] (dramatic music) We've had a big, massive bank bailout again
[00:12] in the last couple of weeks. We've had a couple of banks fail out west,
[00:19] and of course this is all because of their poor risk management policies.
[00:26] But the real problem, the deep down problem in the roots is American central banking.
[00:32] We know these banks are bailed out by the Federal Reserve. And this issue of what banks can do or not do
[00:38] or the problem of central banking in particular to the American political and legal system
[00:44] and the economic system is something people have discussed in the United States for over 200 years.
[00:54] It is Wednesday, March 22nd, 2023. Let's start off with this.
[01:00] Today, we're gonna hear what the Fed's gonna do and they're going to dictate to all of us
[01:05] how we're gonna live our lives. That is, they're going to be raising rates.
[01:08] They will raise rates today. They're going to consolidate the entire banking system
[01:15] into fewer institutions. That's all this is, a setup for central banks,
[01:22] the Federal Reserve in this case, to issue their new monetary system.
[01:27] - Hi Chair, Katerina Saraiba with Bloomberg News. The minutes of the January, February meeting,
[01:36] the last meeting, indicate that you discussed the possibility of runs on non-bank financial institutions
[01:44] and the impact of large unrealized losses on bank portfolios.
[01:48] Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion? Kind of what was talked about in light of that?
[01:55] And then why didn't the Fed do anything about that at that point to ultimately prevent
[02:01] what happened this month? - I mean, to be honest,
[02:04] I don't recall the specifics of that. It's been quite an interesting seven weeks.
[02:09] But I think, as you know, as it is now in the public record, the supervisory team was apparently engaged,
[02:19] very much engaged with the bank, repeatedly and was escalating.
[02:23] But, you know, nonetheless, what happened happened. - Can you confirm whether or not the board knew
[02:28] about these escalations by the examiners in San Francisco? - I will have to come back to you on that.
[02:37] I don't know. - How many of you out here really believe
[02:44] that all this is happening only just by some kind of freak show accident?
[02:50] No, this is all deliberate here. Why do you think central banks
[02:54] have been raising rates aggressively into a free-fall economy, okay?
[02:59] Do you think, honestly, that this banking crisis, honestly, the regulators missed it?
[03:04] You really think so? You really think the U.S. Treasury missed it?
[03:08] You think that too? And you think the Federal Reserve wasn't keenly aware
[03:13] that all this was going on? (dramatic music)
[03:18] It's thought that we have this very wild swing, all these wild swings in the economy,
[03:23] because we don't have any regulation. We don't have proper control of this banking system.
[03:30] The real issue, though, is not that. The real issue in all of this
[03:34] is federal spending and federal policy. We just think this is the way,
[03:38] this is what we're going to do, and so we ride on the wave all the time
[03:43] of these kind of reckless things that happen, and who knows?
[03:47] I mean, we keep kicking the can down the road. Who knows how long we can keep kicking the can
[03:52] before it really does become a major problem in the United States,
[03:55] and we start seeing a major financial rupture, not just in the United States, but also around the world.
[04:01] (dramatic music) (upbeat music)
[04:06] - Hello, and welcome to "Incubator Weekly." We have a full house today, as you can see.
[04:21] Firstly, I'm Amanda, and I'm joined, as always, by my trusty co-host, Rion.
[04:25] How's it going, Rion? - Going really, really well.
[04:28] - Good. - Good for the financial system, of course.
[04:32] - One of them. We are rejoined this week by a prior guest,
[04:36] Dash developer, A.J. O'Neill. How's it going, A.J.?
[04:40] - Hello, hello. - Good. - I'm doing well.
[04:43] - Excellent. And then joining us for the first time this week
[04:46] is Dash developer, Will Merfalin. How are you today, Will?
[04:51] - I'm doing well. How are you guys?
[04:53] - Yeah, we're feeling good. So, Will, you're the one we know least here, naturally.
[04:58] So, before we get kicked off with other things, namely privacy in Dash things,
[05:05] would you tell us a bit about your crypto background and what brought you to Incubator?
[05:11] - Sure. I've been working with C++
[05:17] and full-stack web development for a very long time. Systems development, in general,
[05:22] is something that I'm very passionate about, and Dash Incubator has been one of those avenues
[05:29] in which I've been able to kind of use that talent and that passion.
[05:34] So, yeah, I've always been into tech. I got introduced to the Incubator through A.J.
[05:43] - Not another one, really. Dang, A.J., that offsets some of your negatives.
[05:50] All right, good. - So, yeah, thank you, A.J.
[05:57] Yeah, I would go to the meetups, and A.J. was just constantly talking about this Dash thing,
[06:04] and I was like, "I had better check it out," and I haven't looked back since.
[06:08] It's been a very cool experience. - Righteous.
[06:11] Well, happy to meet you and happy to have you, Will. So, today we're going to have a group discussion,
[06:18] of course, among the four of us, but also, of course, any live chat viewers
[06:22] are welcome to contribute just about the state of privacy within the Dash network in general,
[06:27] and then we will move into a new concept that has been brought to the Incubator by Will,
[06:34] which has to do with Dash mixing within the browser. I don't even want to say too much
[06:40] because I don't know too much, and then we will finish up by asking
[06:45] some user-submitted questions that came in via social media this past week.
[06:50] So, without any further ado, Rion, what is the state of privacy on the Dash network?
[06:57] - Well, I wanted to actually start by broadening it out to privacy in general, and as you know,
[07:06] we start each of these Incubator Weekly videos with a recap from what happened in the previous week,
[07:15] and something that, at least, I curate these clips just from what I'm watching throughout the week,
[07:22] each week, and it's becoming obvious. More recently, I think it's been pretty obvious,
[07:30] at least for me and most of you who've been watching, that central banks and governments,
[07:37] they do not want you to control your own money, and I believe, I have no direct evidence of this
[07:45] other than plenty, like, oodles and mounds of circumstantial evidence that there's basically,
[07:53] they're orchestrating a transition from our current monetary system
[07:59] to one that's even more dystopian, as if it could be worse than it already is,
[08:04] and how that relates to privacy, specifically, it relates to private property more generally.
[08:11] They don't want you in control of your money, and Dash has the exact opposite vision,
[08:17] which is that we want you in full control of your money, not only where you spend that and how you spend that,
[08:26] but we also want you to have privacy in that. It's definitely, it's a natural right.
[08:33] It's stemming from natural law itself, so no matter what your beliefs are,
[08:40] we shouldn't have to justify why we want privacy. They should have to justify why they want to spy on us
[08:49] and monitor and control all of our transactions, so I've just been, I want to get back to Dash's roots.
[08:58] Dash was the first cryptocurrency that had privacy as one of its fundamental focuses,
[09:06] and we may have slipped a little bit in our technology. I don't know that.
[09:13] We might still be on the top as far as I know, but very few cryptocurrencies have any kind of privacy,
[09:20] and I want to change that, so I'm taking a look at our current state,
[09:24] and I brought in Will to look at that more deeply because he has a pretty extensive understanding of C++
[09:34] and how our code base would work because he understands that,
[09:39] and I want him and AJ to look as skeptically as they can to our privacy and see,
[09:48] is it actually giving us what we think it's giving us? Is it giving us privacy?
[09:53] Is it more commercial-grade privacy where the barista might not know how much money that we have,
[10:00] but the NSA could definitely figure us out? What level of privacy do we have,
[10:08] and how can we make that better? Also, in terms of this project that's coming up,
[10:13] I want it to be more accessible to lots of different developers,
[10:18] so right now, the only way it's accessible is by downloading and running
[10:23] either the full Dash Core node or Electrum, which, as a side note,
[10:30] Incubator is working on getting back up and running and is pretty far along with that,
[10:38] but outside of that, we don't have JavaScript apps, web apps,
[10:43] which is a huge deal. They have no access
[10:46] to being able to use Coinjoin's functions. - "So how hard would it be," asks James Doe,
[10:56] "to create a Dash-based VPN? "I see a lot of content creators
[11:00] "advertising NordVPN and so on. "If Dash has a VPN,
[11:04] "maybe it would find a better entryway "into Dash usage itself."
[11:08] - Well, that is a different topic, but an interesting one.
[11:13] Let's save that for later, but I think that Dash could have a VPN,
[11:21] and a project that it will cross over into Dash at some point this year,
[11:29] I actually am putting servers in a data center right now. - Awesome.
[11:34] - So then there's also, I think a lot of people,
[11:39] when they talk about VPNs, they're like, "Oh, it's privacy,"
[11:44] and really what it is is you're taking the data
[11:50] that used to be under the control of your internet service provider,
[11:53] like let's say you have Comcast or Google Fiber, you're taking that traffic
[11:57] and now just giving it to a different party, like NordVPN, right?
[12:02] So the expectation is that, "Oh, it's private,"
[12:08] but it's just NordVPN now has your traffic, and your current ISP can't see it
[12:14] 'cause it's encrypted through the VPN, so. - It just moves the trust from the ISP to NordVPN.
[12:20] - Yes, and then they think, "Oh, cool, we're safe,"
[12:23] and it's like, "Well, did you do your due diligence "in researching NordVPN?"
[12:28] I'm not saying specific, I'm just using them as an example,
[12:32] but do your due diligence, learn who's behind the VPN,
[12:38] and then move forward with that. But I think that's what he was kind of getting at
[12:45] is that he wants to kind of shift his data to something that Dash owns,
[12:53] if I'm not mistaken. - Let's move back a little bit
[12:58] on the general topic that it sounds like, AJ and Will,
[13:03] you're both looking into, which is, as Rion asked,
[13:09] just what level of privacy are we being offered within the Dash network right now?
[13:14] To give a bit of retrospective, there are two main, I guess,
[13:20] tests of Dash's privacy that I'm aware of that have taken place to date.
[13:25] One, I think, was put out some seven, eight years ago, maybe by Macrochip, someone said,
[13:32] and it was a bounty. It was maybe even a $10,000 bounty,
[13:36] payable in Dash, I'm sure, for someone to effectively unscramble
[13:42] a specific CoinJoin transaction. And in the case of this CoinJoin transaction,
[13:48] I think it took place back when the default mixing rounds within the core wallet were, I think,
[13:54] only four or eight or something, which is half of what they are now.
[13:58] And to my knowledge, nobody ever claimed that bounty. The second test I'm aware of
[14:03] took place about two to three years ago when an individual who was actually quite active
[14:10] in the Monero community put up a donation request
[14:16] for an upgrade to his server and hardware infrastructure so that he could run a bunch of tests
[14:22] on Dash's CoinJoin transactions. And he published the findings of his report.
[14:28] And to my recollection, his general conclusion was something like
[14:33] all CoinJoin transactions on the Dash network ever, of all of them, roughly 80%,
[14:42] he could not find any origins of those inputs. And so it was our guess, or it was my guess,
[14:51] that the 20% where he said, "Hmm, actually, I think I can de-scramble these,"
[14:56] were probably people who didn't use best practices. And I'm sure all of us would agree
[15:01] that our users shouldn't have to read a whole report on best practices to use CoinJoin effectively,
[15:07] but those were his results nevertheless. So Will and/or AJ, what are your take on those two tests?
[15:14] What are the results of those two tests? What do you think?
[15:18] - So I'll start. - Please.
[15:22] - I think that the one, if you, so theoretically, theoretically CoinJoin works, in theory.
[15:29] So if you prop up a use case that's a purely theoretical use case
[15:33] and you follow the white paper, so to speak, then yeah, you end up with perfect privacy, whatever.
[15:39] But that's not how things really work. I have not actually looked into that.
[15:44] I've heard about that bounty. I haven't looked into it to solve it
[15:48] because I imagine that the bounty was created in such a way that it follows all the theory of it,
[15:56] and so it won't be reversible, and so it's a waste of time to try.
[16:00] But in practice, what you do with money is you spend it. The goal of money is not to hoard it in one location
[16:07] and never use it. Because if I want to keep my dollars perfectly safe,
[16:11] I just put them in the fire pit and I light them on fire, and now no one has access to them.
[16:16] And I think that that's effectively what's been done in the first case
[16:19] is the dash has been taken out of circulation. If the dash has been taken out of circulation,
[16:24] then yeah, sure, it's perfectly safe, whatever. But that's boring because you can't use it
[16:29] if it's taken out of circulation. So if all you do is CoinJoin
[16:32] and take your money out of circulation, sure. But the moment you take it into circulation,
[16:38] I think that that's where the problems are going to arise because this is, the protocol basically
[16:43] only benefits from network effect. If there's no network effect,
[16:47] then I understand theoretically that it shouldn't be reversible,
[16:52] but I just don't believe that in practice it's not easily reversible if the money is being spent.
[16:58] Now, 80% of that is probably, and I could be wrong, but 'cause I've got no real information,
[17:05] I'm taking a wild guess because I'm being super skeptical, I bet that 80% is in masternode money
[17:11] that's been taken out of circulation, and the 20% is the money that's actually been circulated.
[17:15] - And so what is it exactly about circulation that you think would be more revelatory?
[17:23] What would it be about that? - So the CoinJoin is not widely deployed.
[17:32] There's only one avenue of access for it, which is Dash Core.
[17:36] And most people, if you're spending money, you're not spending money through Dash Core.
[17:39] It's an absolutely horrible interface and everybody knows that, that's no surprise.
[17:45] It's old, it's crufty. It was college kids using the GTK framework
[17:50] that their professor told them about or something, or QT. - Shots fired.
[17:55] - But no, but this is what it is. And I mean, that's normal, that's normal.
[17:59] When you're a college kid and you're doing a project, you use QT or GTK or whatever 'cause it's what's on the table
[18:05] and you use C++ 'cause that's what your professor learned back in the '50s or, you know, and so that's normal stuff.
[18:12] But my point is that people aren't realistically using Dash Core to do transactions and none of the other stuff
[18:20] in the Dash ecosystem supports CoinJoin on either side, either sending or receiving.
[18:26] So for example, Dash Direct does not support CoinJoin. We don't have any way to get CoinJoin coins
[18:31] shared between wallets. If you try to create an HD wallet in Dash Core
[18:38] and share it on your phone, your phone app will crash and you will have to literally delete the app
[18:43] from your phone because the phone app is only designed to handle up to like 1,000 transactions or something.
[18:50] So you run CoinJoin once or twice and you've maxed out the limit of the number of transactions
[18:55] that it can display and it'll just crash. - So I think what you're talking about
[18:58] is 1,000 change addresses, which normally is not an issue. For wallets, like what you're getting at is,
[19:07] so when CoinJoin happens, it splits everything up into different change addresses
[19:13] and you're limited to 1,000 per wallet. But the wallet can regenerate those.
[19:18] - No, what I mean is that when you're on the phone, if you're not thinking about it, which you wouldn't
[19:25] unless you encounter the problem, you're gonna use the Android built-in
[19:29] or the iOS built-in data list. And that built-in data list consumes some amount of memory
[19:34] and there's some specifications for, hey, if you need to use more than so many items
[19:38] in a data list view, you need to do this to unload it out of memory and reload it into memory.
[19:43] And I'm just speaking from broad, I don't know the specifics of the Dash iOS wallet.
[19:48] I just know broadly speaking, this is how these things work. So what will happen is that the app basically,
[19:55] it runs out of memory. That it loads too many items in the data list,
[19:59] the data list can't handle it and then the app just crashes. That's my intuition from my observation of trying this.
[20:06] So, but my point is you can't use CoinJoin on your phone. Even if you share the HD wallet,
[20:11] you can't use CoinJoin on your phone 'cause the app just crashes.
[20:14] But let's say that you could. Let's say you could get it on your phone.
[20:17] Let's say that bug gets fixed. And maybe it has been fixed 'cause I raised this up
[20:22] six months ago or so and I just kind of, you know, plopped it in a channel somewhere and somebody said,
[20:27] "Oh yeah." And so maybe it did get fixed.
[20:29] So let's say that you can do that. Well now you try to use DashDirect.
[20:33] DashDirect has dirty transactions. And by dirty transactions,
[20:36] I mean transactions that are fingerprints. So if you send a CoinJoin transaction to DashDirect,
[20:44] it's a dirty transaction and it's got lots of extra digits, right?
[20:50] 'Cause when we transact, we generally, we don't care about fractions of fractions of a penny,
[20:55] you know, I don't care about one millionth of a penny. That should just round, you know,
[20:59] round it up to the nearest penny and move on with your life. That would be a clean transaction.
[21:03] But the dirty transactions, they carry every little fraction of a penny.
[21:09] Excuse me, pardon my French for saying the word penny, but that's, you know, that realistically,
[21:14] that's what we're doing. - You're saying because DashDirect requires
[21:17] like some certain dollar amount and then that dollar amount is converted into a dash amount
[21:21] that's like 2.97542. That's quite unique. - Well, except with eight digits,
[21:29] not just four. - Yeah, that's quite unique.
[21:32] And so you'd be able to trace that to a transaction. - Yeah, and so it's just like with other protocols,
[21:40] anytime you have something that's quote unquote private, but on the one side it's not private
[21:43] and on the other side it's not private, given enough transactions,
[21:47] you can just reconnect the strands. And in practice, when I've used CoinJoin,
[21:52] when I've used CoinJoin Send, it's like using 119 coins,
[21:57] any number of coins beyond 10 may affect your privacy. Well, it's like, well, the protocol doesn't support a way
[22:03] to give me denominations that make any sense. And so when I have to pay 28.93 of, you know,
[22:11] if that's what the amount comes out to, then it's gonna use 119 coins
[22:16] because it tends towards creating really, really, really tiny coins
[22:21] 'cause it always wants to take basically the change you get back and then split it up
[22:25] into really, really even smaller amounts. So to build up the smaller numbers,
[22:30] you have tens of coins. And then on the larger side,
[22:33] you have on average five coins per digit. So if you need to pay an amount that's four digits,
[22:39] that's 20 coins right out of the box, right? Because the denominations don't make any sense
[22:44] for the way that we actually spend money. In the natural world, we have doubles, wholes, and halves,
[22:50] right, so everything is a 20, a 10, and a five, a double, a whole, and a half.
[22:54] And that's what we would need in CoinJoin in order to bring the number of coins per digit
[22:58] down to below two on average, slightly below two, it'd be about two.
[23:02] - And so how feasible is that? And, you know, so if I'm thinking I'm a core developer
[23:10] and I wanted to choose the denominations and I chose, okay, 10, one, 0.1,
[23:14] and et cetera, and et cetera, and et cetera, how feasible is it actually to choose the wholes?
[23:20] Halves, and whatever? Instead, like, is the idea that maybe core developers
[23:26] didn't choose that because they imagined that it would be more difficult to find mixing partners?
[23:31] Or why does anybody imagine this was? - I mean, I think it's kind of taking suggestions
[23:39] from how usually like American-based currency is split up. You got $1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, et cetera.
[23:50] The five different denominations, like so if you use AJ's number,
[23:56] I think it was like 28.93 dash, you can use each of those denominations to split it up.
[24:06] You got 210, 210 dash, and then you have, what, 811 dash,
[24:14] and then the 0.93, there's also denominations for that. So like I don't understand what the real argument was
[24:24] for that, how it couldn't be split up like that. So you can split it up using those standard fives.
[24:30] - No, because it only gives you one. The only, it's only sliding one, right?
[24:36] So if you have a nine, that requires nine inputs. So anytime you have a digit that's the number nine,
[24:42] that requires nine inputs. There are no fives and twenties.
[24:47] Everything is only a one. It's a sliding scale of one.
[24:50] And as to why it's that way, I don't know, 'cause I haven't talked to them,
[24:54] but just looking at the code, I think it's because it's cute,
[24:57] because it makes a bit sequence. So basically in binary, there's ones and zeros,
[25:05] and it just looks cute. Like, if you look at it, if you look at the code,
[25:08] it's just cute code. It's just cute.
[25:10] It's cute because you can bit shift over by one for each. - Bit shift?
[25:15] - Bit shift, it's called bit shifting. - So I'm not gonna get into the details of that.
[25:19] - Yeah, it's, but it looks cute. That's the reason I think they did it.
[25:22] I don't think they did it for any other reason than that it's cute.
[25:25] It's like, oh, cool bits. - I have to soften that a bit,
[25:28] because I don't wanna say that, like, we don't have a solution that we know works better
[25:38] than what we have right now yet. The point of this discussion is to say
[25:44] that we are looking into it, and if we can find improvements
[25:47] that don't have the drawbacks that maybe Dash Core Group has already seen
[25:51] with other proposed solutions, we're going to pursue that. - Well, to what degree is Will's concept a solution?
[26:02] Obviously, correct me if I'm wrong, Will, your solution has nothing to do
[26:06] with changing denominations or anything, but rather to address one of AJ's other points,
[26:12] which would be to bring the mixing closer to the point of spending,
[26:16] in this case, maybe even mobile, or what? - Well, we want something that anybody
[26:25] can just drop into their browser and start using. Now, the browser alone won't be able
[26:32] to directly contact the Dash network and instigate a lot of this stuff.
[26:40] We would have to initiate a lot of that, so that's why I propose a solution
[26:45] where we have it run on server side and we have it run in the browser,
[26:49] and my presentation actually goes over that. - Let's have a look.
[26:53] - Okay, sounds good. Okay, so Dash PrivateSend, we're building a browser SDK.
[27:01] You guys know a little bit about me. Here's some stuff about me as well.
[27:08] I was born in San Diego, moved to Utah in 2012. I enjoy all the nerdy things.
[27:14] I'm a fairly decent artist, and I like making music. My technical qualifications,
[27:22] I've been doing full-stack web development for 10 years, Linux enthusiast.
[27:27] I also do C++ system development. I write network protocols, assembler programming,
[27:32] and that's my Twitter and GitHub right there. Some of the things I'll be talking about,
[27:41] the reasoning for using PrivateSend, how PrivateSend works in a high-level overview
[27:46] of the browser SDK, and then finally, I'll get into the nitty-gritty
[27:50] networking package structure. What is PrivateSend?
[27:55] I'm just gonna kind of gloss over this. We already know it's the way to mix, you know,
[28:01] coins so that you can have non-custodial, or so that you can obfuscate where your coins end up.
[28:10] It gives you consumer-grade financial privacy. You retain control over your money at all times,
[28:20] and it's incredibly easy to use. Why would you need it?
[28:26] The idea of a distributed ledger means that every transaction can be tracked.
[28:31] This is stuff that is well-known, and it's the purpose for PrivateSend.
[28:38] Privacy on the internet is a non-popular opinion. Everybody has your data.
[28:42] Everybody's trying to sell it. If companies or entities wanna track
[28:50] what you've been doing because of the way a distributed ledger is built,
[28:57] there's no way you can just go back and erase that. And also, PrivateSend mirrors
[29:06] the standard expectation of privacy with everyday transactions.
[29:09] And what I mean by that is there used to be a time where your parents gave you $5.
[29:14] You'd walk down to the store. You'd buy a conch book, a stick of gum, and a soda.
[29:19] And for the most part, there wasn't a ledger that kept track of that exact thing.
[29:25] Now, maybe the store might keep track of that, but they don't have your name
[29:30] and the address from which your bills came from. There's no such thing.
[29:37] I believe PrivateSend facilitates that for us a little bit. How it works, this is a little bit more in-depth,
[29:47] but you need a full node. It contacts a master node.
[29:52] It adds you to either a new or an existing CoinJoin queue with at least two other participants.
[30:00] So it relies on other people wanting to do this. The CoinJoin queue will be locked
[30:08] when the master node is satisfied with how many participants.
[30:12] The more, the better. That's great, but it only needs three.
[30:16] And on TestNet, it only needs two, so you and one other person.
[30:21] It breaks down the coins into denominations. They end up being paid to yourself in those addresses
[30:30] that the mixing begins. And this can actually be configured in your wallet,
[30:37] and you can say, "I want at least eight or nine," or you can tell how many rounds that you prefer.
[30:47] This will repeat until the number of rounds is performed, and then all peers sign their transaction.
[30:57] When I say peers, I mean everybody who's in the CoinJoin queue.
[31:02] The result is that your funds end up in denominations. We went over this.
[31:07] Any observer would have a hard time tracking where your Dash ends up.
[31:15] That's the purpose. And this can be performed many times,
[31:20] and you are limited to 1,000 change addresses, but normally this is not an issue at all.
[31:26] Your wallet can generate more. And there should be an option
[31:32] for even HD wallets to generate more. What does it cost?
[31:38] So there is a collateral that is attached to a CoinJoin session, and that's something
[31:45] that all peers kind of agree on before mixing begins. There is a one in 10 chance that collateral is charged.
[31:55] And the actual code looks exactly like this. If getRandInt, so give me an integer
[32:02] that's between one and 100, and if it's greater than 10, or in other words, if 90% of the time,
[32:11] or yeah, so if 90% of the time, we're gonna return early. We're not even gonna process this collateral.
[32:19] Also, if a peer misbehaves, masternodes can choose to charge them a fee.
[32:27] That's also random, too, and I can go into that, but I won't be speaking about that for the scope of this.
[32:33] - I am curious, is the getRandomInt, does that happen to be cryptographically random?
[32:40] Do you know? - It's a fast random context,
[32:46] is what they call it in the code. It's for speed over security,
[32:56] from what I can tell. But I'd have to really look into that.
[33:00] I can get a better answer for you. - We should make it so our browser version
[33:07] plays against the fast random algorithm, 'cause it's not gonna be an even distribution,
[33:11] and make sure our people don't get charged the fee ever. - Or use math.random, right?
[33:18] Okay, so if multiple peers misbehave, they will be put into a list,
[33:28] and it'll shuffle that list, and then it's basically,
[33:33] it's basically Russian roulette, the first person that gets charged.
[33:41] It's not, it's definitely not, there's no rules to it, really.
[33:47] It's up to the random number generator. My proposal for the SDK is that we have two parts,
[33:56] well, two parts and one optional part. We have the node.js SDK,
[34:01] which we'll have to run on a server. There's no way we can get around that.
[34:05] And then we'll have the browser SDK, which contacts the node part through RESTful API.
[34:12] The third optional part would be a WebSocket server, which would, I think, be the best way
[34:23] that a client can interact with our code, because they could get very fast, up-to-date information
[34:32] regarding their CoinJoin info, and the status and everything.
[34:37] I would say it would rival the Dash Core wallet as far as how much, or how fast you'll get a notification
[34:46] of that stuff. So, I kind of already went over that.
[34:52] So, the node SDK runs on the server. We'll be exposing, oops, we'll be exposing,
[34:58] oops, let me go back. We'll be exposing a RESTful API.
[35:02] The browser can start, stop, join session, get mixing status, CoinJoin info.
[35:09] And then the WebSocket stuff, as well, is reiterated there. The reason for a node SDK is because
[35:18] we can serve this over SSL. We're talking about privacy.
[35:23] If you have a browser SDK that's directly hitting like a node HTTP, or the node JSON RPC port,
[35:35] that's not authenticated, and it's not intended for public use.
[35:45] We need a secure web server that is running over SSL to give us maximum security for that.
[35:57] And also, a node SDK would give us a lot of flexibility, and we can actually add a lot more value
[36:04] to what we can offer a browser-based solution. Development has started.
[36:14] The node SDK and the browser SDK have started. There are, I'm thinking of coming up with nicknames
[36:24] just to be cute. Everybody has a nickname,
[36:26] but it'll probably just be called like Dash Join or something.
[36:30] Now I'm gonna go into the technical overview of Dash networking.
[36:36] This is for programmers and network enthusiasts. The Dash network package structure,
[36:46] it's a peer-to-peer networking layer that's all done in TCP connection-oriented sockets.
[36:51] Packets are sent over the wire. They're wrapped in a message header, which we'll go over.
[36:56] A node communicates with master nodes. Master nodes handle the coin join interactions.
[37:03] Really, the only responsibility of a node is just to let a master node that you wanna start
[37:15] and stop a session. Yeah, so 99% of all the traffic will be between a node
[37:26] and a master node. You'll never see any other peer
[37:31] within the coin join session. The message headers wrap the coin join interactions
[37:40] into the coin join messages. There's different types of messages here, DSA, DSQ.
[37:46] I'll have links to that in further slides. The Dash networking looks like this.
[37:52] There's the source. The node will send DSA, DSI requests.
[37:59] The master node responds. That continues for the entirety of the coin join.
[38:05] Start, join pool, start, mix, all that stuff. The entire process is handled by a node and a master node.
[38:12] The DSTX means that everybody in the coin join session has signed the transaction.
[38:23] And that gets sent over the network. The message header in depth.
[38:31] The message headers is typically 24 bytes as a message start, message command,
[38:37] or a message start, a command size and checksum. The command is literally just a string.
[38:42] When people say, oh, we're sending a DSQ over the network, if you notice on the right,
[38:49] you see K, then a dot, then DSQ. That's raw packet capture off the internet
[38:56] that you can capture with TCV dump or Wireshark. This is all readily available.
[39:04] See, I've correlated it. I've cross-referenced it with the C++ code.
[39:11] This is how it's done. So it's fairly open.
[39:16] Which, I mean, I don't particularly like that it's that open, but this is just how it works currently.
[39:27] I would like to see some improvements on that. These are the different message types.
[39:35] So the CoinJoin protocol, I guess you could say, is a lot of the stuff isn't directly available
[39:49] via the JSON RPC. The JSON RPC has three calls related to CoinJoin,
[39:57] and it's fairly limited in what we want. I would like to see potentially moving forward
[40:05] something that mimics the actual traffic that a node is sending to a master node.
[40:15] That's something I would like to see in our SDK, 'cause I don't think it's something
[40:22] that would be too difficult to accomplish. There's more info, but that is my presentation.
[40:32] I give links here for further reading. I have a link to the GitHub repo
[40:38] that we're currently working on, and I do have some links to,
[40:45] most of them are most likely gonna be Amanda B. Johnson's videos on PrivateSend,
[40:50] which I suggest everybody go check out. They're really helpful, but yeah.
[40:57] - Well, UginM6 coached me through the making of those, so thanks to him as well.
[41:02] - Can you drop that link, Will, so that we can get that in the chat
[41:06] so people like me, for example, can take a look at that and see it in...
[41:11] - Sure. - 'Cause the StreamYard kind of scales down.
[41:14] It makes it hard to read and see some of the particular words and links and stuff.
[41:19] - Okay. - So am I understanding correctly, then,
[41:25] what we're seeing here proposed, and of course, very technical detail,
[41:30] is the creation of an incubator-run server, which could facilitate dash coin join mixing
[41:41] by browser-based clients. Is that correct?
[41:47] Okay, okay, and please. - If I'm not mistaken,
[41:51] Will, you have enough information now that we're not limited to having to run a full node
[41:56] to do that. We could actually just pack that in a buffer
[42:00] and send it across the wire in Node, and we could have a standalone reference implementation.
[42:05] Is that correct? - Well, we would need access to a node.
[42:09] We definitely would. - So we can't do it standalone?
[42:16] Okay, nevermind. - Well, I think it's possible to do it standalone.
[42:26] Currently, right now, I think the easiest way would be to have Node,
[42:30] but I do think we could do it ourselves in Node as well, which I would probably prefer.
[42:36] - 'Cause my understanding was, because it communicates to the master node directly,
[42:40] not doing a broadcast to the network, we don't actually have to have 90% of the code
[42:47] that would be necessary for a normal transaction send, because we're just doing a round trip back and forth
[42:53] between one master node over a TCP session. - Yeah.
[42:59] - Okay, so we could do that part standalone. And I'm hoping that's the case,
[43:05] and I'm looking forward to that. - I wanted to give one potential application of this.
[43:13] As many of you know, we've had the Maya guys on recently, and so Dash will be part of the Maya-supported coins,
[43:23] which it goes along with Ethereum and Bitcoin, for example. So if somebody in Bitcoin wanted to have some privacy,
[43:35] get some privacy features through Bitcoin or through Dash, but for Bitcoin, they could do that through Maya.
[43:43] So you could have a web app that accepts Bitcoin. You send Bitcoin to the web app.
[43:50] The web app then transfers that into Dash. Then the web app, once it's in Dash,
[43:57] it mixes those coins in Dash, then transfers it back to Bitcoin.
[44:02] And now somebody that doesn't really care about Dash still can have a use case for Dash through Maya.
[44:08] - Okay. And so then, I guess, is this kind of like a...
[44:17] It's a sort of hybrid solution in a way. It's obviously not pure protocol executed, right?
[44:24] Because that, at least as of the current time, does require running a full node.
[44:29] And so it's incubator offering up a sort of stepping stone, which, you know, while we realize
[44:37] that having a single incubator-run server is not an ideal long-term solution,
[44:43] it would ideally get more people mixing. And like Rion just said,
[44:48] more people potentially using Dash just for the privacy features.
[44:52] And so it's like a sort of centralized stepping stone to the decentralized Dash network.
[44:58] Is that accurate? - Well, I think whatever code that we write
[45:03] will be open source. So if somebody doesn't like the centralized service,
[45:07] they can always spin up their whole infrastructure on their own.
[45:11] Got it. - That centralized is a dirty word.
[45:15] Decentralized is when you have the option of choice. This will be decentralized
[45:19] and that you will have the option of choice. - Yes.
[45:22] - It won't be decentralized from the perspective of you are forced to submit to anonymous untrusted services.
[45:29] I don't like that definition of decentralized, which seems to be used quite often.
[45:36] Because you don't know what something is doesn't make it trustworthy.
[45:39] And because you do know what something is doesn't make it trustworthy.
[45:43] But if you trust it, then it's trustworthy, or at least you trust it.
[45:46] - Yeah, I guess I'm more meant, in case of a weather event or a connection event,
[45:52] if incubators server that offers up this service goes down, the stepping stone would not be available
[46:00] for anyone who had been utilizing it. But as you two are saying,
[46:04] because this would be open source, anybody could spin up such a stepping stone.
[46:08] - Well, it's like spinning up a full node, right? Generally, you probably, well you,
[46:15] you personally may have your own full node running. I think most people don't have a full node running.
[46:21] And so whenever they're doing anything on the Dash network, they are connecting to some full node
[46:26] that's provided by the app that they're using or the service that they're using or whatever.
[46:33] And I think that it's really important to expose that so that you can see where are you connecting to
[46:40] and you can choose what do you wanna connect to. But ultimately, yeah, you,
[46:47] there should be multiple options for what you want to connect to.
[46:53] I mean, even we running this, we should run more than one. - And possibly in different data centers geographically.
[47:06] AJ, did you have a, yeah, did you have an answer to one time's question?
[47:11] - Yeah, so one time asked, doesn't fewer mixing denomination levels
[47:15] having only one per order of magnitude have the effect of making it more difficult
[47:20] to try to analyze and discern between identical input amounts
[47:23] because it means that there are more of the same mixing amounts.
[47:26] So fundamentally, this is the correct assumption because this is what we're trying to avoid
[47:32] in the first place. We don't want dirty transactions.
[47:34] Dirty transactions are where every single digit is so unique that it provides a fingerprint.
[47:40] We want clean transactions where there are a discrete number of inputs
[47:46] or a discrete number of categories of inputs that we can use.
[47:51] You have to weigh that against the cost of the other factors of the fingerprint.
[47:56] So yes, if you could only price things in the real world, if things were only priced,
[48:03] pardon my French, $1, $10, $100, then that would help make this the perfect system.
[48:12] But in the real world, things aren't priced by single denominations.
[48:16] So what we want to tend towards is the distribution average of coins per digit.
[48:22] So how many digits are there in the payment that you're going to make
[48:27] and how many coins do you need to make up that number, that specific number per digit?
[48:33] So while, yes, in one theoretical scenario, having only one denomination per order of magnitude
[48:43] would be the best, you have to weigh that against would you rather that the average
[48:49] be that you have five coins per digit, which means that you have five opportunities
[48:55] for fingerprinting, because even every coin represents an aspect of a fingerprint,
[49:01] a bit of a fingerprint, and we want to reduce the number of bits of fingerprint.
[49:06] So if you're looking at it from that perspective, the number of coins per digit
[49:14] are going to contribute more to the fingerprinting factor of unwinding where did this coin come from
[49:22] than having two more coins per order of magnitude so that you on average have slightly less
[49:31] than two coins per digit in an even distribution. And the distribution isn't even,
[49:36] but the way that we price things person to person actually tends towards one coin per digit.
[49:43] And the way that we price things commercially tends towards lots of nines,
[49:48] which would give us the highest number of coins. That would put us at an average
[49:51] of close to three coins per digit. But when we price things commercially,
[49:56] we also typically add taxes and taxes roll those nines over to zeros
[50:01] with a seven at the end, which brings us back closer to one coin per digit again.
[50:07] So on average, even with an uneven distribution and the way that we actually use money,
[50:12] I think that that would bring us to right around two coins per digit
[50:16] as opposed to five coins per digit. And not having so many threads
[50:25] through which you can trace where the coin came from is going to have more of an impact
[50:30] than a small number of extra denominations. - Okay.
[50:36] - I just wanted to clarify one thing. Like when you're saying coins per digit,
[50:38] you mean like the number six would require in your system a five and a one.
[50:45] - Yes. - Whereas in the base 10 factor system,
[50:50] it would require six ones. - Yes, exactly.
[50:54] - Okay. Well, we have covered quite a lot here
[50:59] and I know that we could probably talk a lot more about a lot more subjects.
[51:05] I will, however, move us now to two user submitted questions that came in over the past week.
[51:11] To make clear to everyone, we, of course, as usual,
[51:16] are always happy to accept questions live. But if you aren't able to join us live,
[51:22] you can submit them at any time via our social media channels.
[51:25] So in so doing, Grandmaster Dash asked, when alternative code for a masternode server,
[51:33] perhaps exchanges or financial services would appreciate the choice?
[51:37] - Alternative code for a masternode server, is that question like when are we gonna build
[51:46] a different implementation of a masternode, like as opposed to the C++ implementation?
[51:54] Is that how that question is supposed to be interpreted? - That's how I interpreted it.
[51:59] - Well, we've got a Go implementation, half-baked Go implementation, as far as I know.
[52:06] - It's Go, it's the RPCs, it's not. - Yeah.
[52:10] - I mean, I could be mistaken, but it's-- - Half-baked is probably too much.
[52:13] A quarter-baked or a tenth-baked or something like that. - It's like inside API, it's just a wrapper.
[52:19] - What I've seen, we could have something else that I didn't see, but what I've seen,
[52:22] all it is, is it wraps a full node and then makes requests to the full node.
[52:27] - Okay. We don't have any plans to build
[52:32] an alternative full node right now. - Will would have to do that.
[52:37] In order for that to work, we'd have to break the existing code apart into functional libraries
[52:43] that could be reused. Otherwise, I don't think it would possible to,
[52:46] that would have to be the path to get there. It'd have to be somebody that's C++, dude, or gal, dudette.
[52:53] - Okay. Then our second question, let's see that one, Pete.
[52:59] This is from Kryptosi, and he asked us, "When will the incubator start to tackle
[53:04] "or foster projects aiming to build on platform?" My guess is that that would be a question for you, Rion.
[53:19] - Can you guys hear me? I think I had an internet problem there for a minute there.
[53:24] "When will the incubator start to tackle "or foster projects aiming to build on platform?"
[53:29] As soon as platform's ready. We got burned a year ago where we started
[53:34] doing a bunch of platform work, and I think, at least I hope that some of our testing
[53:41] was useful for DCG, but it was very ineffective and inefficient development for us.
[53:46] We spent a lot of time on working with a product that wasn't done yet.
[53:52] So I've pretty much, as far as my own personal strategy, I'm not doing platform projects until it's ready,
[54:01] at least on testnet. - Okay, well, and that leads us perfectly
[54:08] into letting you all know what we have coming up next week. Rion just mentioned his own personal strategy,
[54:15] and next week, Incubator Weekly will actually be the quarterly report for the Dash Incubator.
[54:23] And so we'll hear not only from Rion as the lead strategist, but also from his fellow two strategists, Tim and Ash,
[54:30] and each of them will give us a full recount of everything that they have funded over the last quarter,
[54:38] will let us know anything that they decided to drop funding on and why,
[54:42] and then also tell each of us the financial picture according to their strategy budgets.
[54:49] So we will, of course, happily accept your questions during the call or prior to the call
[54:54] as submitted via social media. So that is all that we have for you today.
[55:00] And fellas, unless any of you has any gems of wisdom to leave us with, I think we'll say, "Sara Nora."
[55:11] That seems like a big no, so. - Mic was muted, but I have nothing more to add.
[55:16] Long show today, but I think it was important. - Good. - I agree.
[55:21] - Okay, well, AJ and Will, thanks for joining us, and we look forward to hearing updates
[55:24] from you in the future. - Cool, see you guys.
[55:27] - Adios.
