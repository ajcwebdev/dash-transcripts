## Episode Description

Ash discusses the upcoming relaunch of a gift card and merchant directory service for Dash, similar to the discontinued Dash Direct.

## Episode Summary

In this episode, Ash provides an update on the upcoming launch of a gift card and merchant directory service for Dash. The service, powered CTX, will allow users to purchase gift cards from over 150,000 US merchant locations at a discount using Dash. Ash outlines the user experience, differences from the discontinued Dash Direct, and plans for future expansion to Canada, Europe, and a potential Visa/MasterCard integration. The service aims to provide interim utility for Dash until more merchants accept it directly.

## Chapters

00:00 - Introduction and Ash's Recent Activities

Ash discusses his recent activities outside of the incubator, including software development contracting, and CTX business operations.

02:00 - Overview of the Dash Web Directory and Gift Card Service

Ash provides a high-level overview of the upcoming Dash Web Directory and gift card service, explaining its similarity to the discontinued Dash Direct and how it will provide interim utility for Dash at over 150,000 US merchant locations.

06:58 - Merchant Coverage and Discount Examples

Ash shares a list of major merchants that will be supported at launch, such as Chipotle, Apple, Starbucks, and Subway, along with the discount percentages users can expect when paying with Dash. He also mentions plans for a Visa card integration.

13:26 - Differences from Dash Direct and Plans for Expansion

Ash explains the key differences between this service and Dash Direct, including CTX's focus on the gift card service as a core business and plans for expansion to Canada and Europe. He also discusses the challenges of working with multiple third parties and navigating regulatory concerns.

18:07 - User Experience and Integration with Dash Wallet

Ash outlines the user experience for purchasing gift cards, which will require an email for authentication but no further KYC for closed-loop gift cards. He also discusses the planned integration with the Dash Core wallet and the potential for a full KYC Visa/MasterCard solution in the future.

27:57 - Launch Timeline and Call for Testers

Ash provides an estimated timeline for the launch of the service, pending the resolution of a third-party blocker, and encourages the community to test and provide feedback once it's live. The initial release will be US-only, with expansion to Canada and Europe planned for later.

[00:00] (laughing)

[00:01] - And we're live.

[00:02] - All right, welcome everyone.

[00:06] Welcome Ash, welcome Anthony.

[00:07] It's been a little while Ash.

[00:11] - Yeah, it's been a little while, sorry.

[00:12] Been busy elsewhere, less incubator stuff,

[00:14] more other stuff, but I'm there, hi.

[00:18] - Yeah.

[00:18] - I think the last time I was on was the quarterly update,

[00:21] I believe, before.

[00:22] - Yep, last time you were on, we still had our intros,

[00:26] so we're jumping right in this time.

[00:29] But yeah, so you've been working on some other stuff,

[00:34] non-incubator stuff.

[00:36] Do you wanna give us just a general,

[00:39] what's Ash been up to lately, and how are things been?

[00:42] - Everything, life with a newborn,

[00:46] software development stuff, or like contracting

[00:50] with some of the stuff with Maya,

[00:52] some of the, mostly the CTX stuff, really,

[00:55] in terms of all of our banking, and legal compliance,

[00:58] and the gift card stuff, that's been an experience

[01:02] in terms of, yeah, building up that side of the business,

[01:06] which I'll have more updates on today.

[01:08] Just in general, just every aspect of CTX stuff,

[01:12] from our UK business, our Canadian business,

[01:15] and now our US incorporated business,

[01:18] the banking for all three of them,

[01:19] the compliance side of things, in terms of our licensing.

[01:23] Yeah, as well as our visas and immigration,

[01:25] which we now have permanent residency in Canada,

[01:27] so we're here for good, as well, if we wanna be,

[01:31] which has finally come through

[01:32] after six years of living here.

[01:33] - Oh, wow, congratulations on that.

[01:36] - The newborn at home, just, well, not a newborn anymore,

[01:38] she's like seven months now,

[01:39] but just life, big life things.

[01:43] - Awesome, well, yeah, congrats on the residency,

[01:48] whatever, yeah, for Canada, that's, I'm sure, a load off,

[01:53] and congrats on the baby.

[01:55] So. - Thank you.

[01:57] - Let's jump into the topic today.

[02:00] Anthony, what was the title here that we're working with?

[02:04] 'Cause it was, it threw me off a little bit, but.

[02:07] - Yeah, it's Dash Web Directory,

[02:11] so a directory on the web instead of the mobile app.

[02:15] It's not exactly the-- - It's also mobile,

[02:17] yeah, yeah, I'm happy to go into more detail on it.

[02:20] We're effectively, on our mobile apps at the moment,

[02:22] we have the Explore Dash page,

[02:24] which is a directory of merchants and ATMs,

[02:27] and those merchants were originally part of Discover Dash,

[02:31] which was a hosted platform, I think, from Dash Force,

[02:34] potentially, or from UpMason, at least,

[02:36] and that then sort of got imported into mobile

[02:41] and when it became defunct,

[02:43] but realistically, there's not a universal way

[02:45] or a single source of these things,

[02:47] and the mobile app is going to have

[02:50] the full-fledged gift card purchase built into it,

[02:53] but what I really want from this

[02:56] is to have a sort of one-stop resource for our users.

[03:00] I think that we did have a,

[03:02] we had a proprietary in-house sort of system for CCX,

[03:06] but I don't think that's healthy.

[03:07] I think if users can access any merchant and provider,

[03:11] 'cause we wanna have coin cards and bit refills,

[03:14] spritz, whatever options in there that they can have,

[03:17] it means that they'll find more utility from the service

[03:20] and then they'll use it more,

[03:21] so ultimately, it is good for us.

[03:23] I think we're probably gonna be, at first,

[03:24] the only flow where you can actually buy a gift card

[03:26] within this sort of service,

[03:27] but in time, I would love to have whichever provider

[03:31] is the best, offers the most discount,

[03:33] has the most coverage, all of them,

[03:35] and just give users that choice,

[03:37] and it's the same with the ATMs and the merchants.

[03:39] We need a way for people to,

[03:41] we had a recent case where someone had an issue

[03:43] with a merchant and that directory

[03:45] is not really well looked after

[03:47] because it's manually maintained by DCG,

[03:49] and this is one of the few examples

[03:51] where there's actually a pretty good use case

[03:52] for platform here in terms of a decentralized repository

[03:56] of up-to-date merchant data, along with comments,

[04:00] along with the actual management of those merchants

[04:03] that can be then used on multiple front ends

[04:06] at different sites and different places,

[04:08] but it's truly accurate

[04:09] because there is a single source of truth on platform,

[04:11] and that is one of the best use cases for platform,

[04:13] that there will be a single source of truth

[04:15] and a historical record of those changes,

[04:18] as well as verification of the sort of identity

[04:21] of the business maintaining those records, really.

[04:25] So there you go.

[04:26] - Yeah, yeah, we dove into quite a bit of detail

[04:30] there already, but can you give us just a high level

[04:34] for somebody like Anthony who may have no familiarity

[04:37] with your involvement in Dash,

[04:40] and I know you've got like Dash Retail,

[04:43] you've got Discover Dash, Dash Spend,

[04:48] - Yeah.

[04:50] - CX, give us a broad overview of what you're working on,

[04:54] and...

[04:56] - Yeah, so the current focus right now

[04:58] is to offer gift cards for large retailers

[05:03] and online sort of merchants in return for Dash

[05:07] that can be instantly bought and used

[05:09] and redeemed at the same time in store.

[05:11] So let's say you were in Best Buy

[05:13] and your order total comes up to $1,000.

[05:16] You would then enter $1,000 on top of that,

[05:18] and we might give you a 1%, 2% discount on top of that.

[05:21] You'll then make that payment in Dash

[05:23] and instantly get a gift card for the full amount,

[05:25] which you then show to the clerk,

[05:26] and then you're able to complete your purchase by using Dash.

[05:29] And it's a way to give Dash that sort of interim utility

[05:32] until merchants are more direct accepting of that Dash.

[05:36] So, and that's the other side of the business

[05:38] is that we have that point of sale sort of system

[05:40] for merchants, and they're kind of tied together

[05:42] quite nicely in that we already have

[05:44] the payment side in place.

[05:47] This allows that kind of in-between.

[05:49] So right now we have over 100 merchants.

[05:53] It'll be soon going up to over 200 merchants,

[05:56] which represents over 150,000 locations across the US.

[05:59] So it's got your Chipotle, your Chili's,

[06:02] your Apple, all these different stores,

[06:05] your Starbucks, your Subway, like Sephora,

[06:08] you know, any of these stores that you might go to

[06:10] that are more, you know, multi-chains, chains, basically.

[06:14] You'll be able to go there and spend Dash,

[06:16] and then complete your purchase.

[06:17] So it just adds that utility.

[06:19] For nearly all of our merchants,

[06:21] we'll be having a discount as well.

[06:24] I do have a list of our initial coverage,

[06:27] which I'll share with you guys shortly.

[06:29] So the goal of this directory

[06:31] is to allow people to find those merchants,

[06:33] to find those locations that they can spend at.

[06:35] And it's not just with us.

[06:36] We wanna bring in the BitRefill coverage in there,

[06:38] which is another provider.

[06:40] Effectively a competitor to us,

[06:41] but I think because this is a Dash incubator project,

[06:44] ultimately, and I think this is good for us too,

[06:47] the more people using this,

[06:48] the more people will end up using us anyway.

[06:50] The more utility you add to this service, the better,

[06:53] because we want people to be using this to live off Dash,

[06:56] which is the goal.

[06:58] And we can then use this as a really good case

[07:01] to win merchants over to a full actual Dash solution

[07:06] that is them accepting Dash rather than a proxy

[07:10] sort of acceptance through their existing gift card system.

[07:14] So yeah, this just works as a nice stepping stone

[07:17] into that and a really good case point

[07:19] to prove that value and that the customer base is there.

[07:22] - Now you mentioned Dash platform

[07:25] and how that might be the single source of truth.

[07:29] So that's a bit of a surprise to me,

[07:32] considering that, yeah, how would that work?

[07:36] So my--

[07:38] - There's two different parts here, sorry.

[07:40] There's a lot.

[07:42] I would say that the Dash platform thing

[07:43] for now will be focused more on the merchants,

[07:45] which are directly accepting Dash,

[07:46] which there are obviously,

[07:48] New Hampshire would be the hotspot for that sort of thing,

[07:50] but there are online merchants and that sort of things,

[07:52] as well as user comments and interactions.

[07:55] But I would say the focus for the Dash platform side of it

[07:58] wouldn't be the existing offering by ourselves

[08:00] that they're refilling,

[08:01] it would be the direct accepting merchants

[08:03] who would be managing their listings.

[08:05] Sort of like a Google My Business kind of equivalent,

[08:09] but then that data would then be

[08:11] in the Dash Core mobile wallet,

[08:12] it would be on this web app

[08:13] and this standalone mobile app that we're building,

[08:16] and it would all come from that

[08:17] and then be easy to maintain in one place

[08:20] and go out to whichever applications

[08:22] wanted to use that data,

[08:23] where any party that wanted to use that.

[08:26] - But the actual purchase flow

[08:28] would not be going through Dash?

[08:31] - No, yeah.

[08:32] I imagine in the future,

[08:33] it would be good to have some sort of point of sale system

[08:35] where the invoices are hosted on platform,

[08:38] but I think that's a way off ultimately

[08:40] until the point where platform can't really handle payments,

[08:43] it doesn't have a trigger so much for payments yet,

[08:45] but there's an idea in the future

[08:48] around having invoices and payments

[08:50] against those invoices powered by platform,

[08:52] but I think that's still a significant way off really.

[08:55] But I would say this in terms of the actual directory side,

[08:58] in terms of maintaining the merchant data,

[09:00] user comments on merchants, ratings,

[09:02] that side of things, all on platform easily enough

[09:05] in its current state.

[09:07] - Okay.

[09:09] Well, do we want to move into your screen share

[09:12] so that we can see some of these?

[09:14] - Yeah.

[09:14] Let's present some stuff.

[09:17] I'll start off with the,

[09:18] just talking about the platform side of thing.

[09:23] The, oh, sorry, the directory,

[09:26] as opposed to the-

[09:27] - And then if you could also pull up the,

[09:32] I don't know if you have the incubator project up as well,

[09:36] but if you could pull that up at some point,

[09:39] 'cause I did want to kind of distinguish

[09:41] between this new incubator bounty project

[09:45] and what you've worked on in the past.

[09:47] I believe the distinction is that it's a web interface,

[09:51] like a web API rather than,

[09:55] - Yeah, well, you can tell us, I guess,

[09:56] what that distinction is from that new project.

[10:00] - Yeah, sure.

[10:01] Absolutely.

[10:02] Okay.

[10:04] Is my screen view visible at the moment?

[10:06] - Yes. - Yes.

[10:07] - Excellent.

[10:08] Okay, so this is just a basic UX for the sort of web flow,

[10:11] for the actual just merchant sort of directory side

[10:13] of things.

[10:14] I just give a basic example to the developer

[10:17] that was working on this so they can get started.

[10:20] Nothing off the bat.

[10:20] Obviously, you can see the kind of merchant coverage

[10:24] that we're going for at the start.

[10:25] It's gonna be a really simple site,

[10:26] allowing you to just search for a merchant,

[10:29] and then either, if they're a direct accepting merchant,

[10:31] you'll be able to see more information about them,

[10:33] or if they're a gift card merchant powered by us,

[10:36] then you'll be able to make the purchase flow

[10:38] for the gift card directly within that site.

[10:41] And if they're a gift card merchant powered by BitRefill,

[10:44] it'll link you offsite towards BitRefill.

[10:48] Same with the ATM app.

[10:49] Mobile is a bit more involved in terms of design-wise.

[10:53] You know, there's gonna be quite a lot more

[10:55] to come on the website of things as well.

[10:58] It's just a matter of fleshing this out over time.

[11:01] Some of this work is already done

[11:03] in terms of map clustering and unique map headings,

[11:05] and turning our data into GeoJSON,

[11:08] a standardized format for location data.

[11:12] So a lot of that work is already done.

[11:14] I'll just run through the flow quickly on here.

[11:17] Obviously, you'll be able to see the kind of discounts

[11:19] that you can get at sort of merchants that are near you.

[11:23] You can then, you know,

[11:24] see a good list of all the different merchants.

[11:28] You can go to your map and see who's near you

[11:32] and what's like local to you.

[11:33] So if you're out and about and you wanna find out

[11:36] who you can go spend on your dash fat nearby

[11:38] and what sort of discounts you'll be able to get,

[11:40] you'll see that.

[11:41] One of the issues with this data is

[11:44] it's not widely available data,

[11:46] so it's gonna have to come from us, from TTX.

[11:49] It's not like we can just scrape Google for this.

[11:52] They don't, they block that quite heavily,

[11:56] so that's not gonna be a particular option.

[11:58] And then you'll be able to make a purchase

[12:01] within here or a goal site, a bit refill or wherever,

[12:06] whomever the providers are for that specific merchant.

[12:09] Then in terms of our actual coverage for us directly

[12:13] for dash spend, which is powered by CTX,

[12:16] I'll just run through the list.

[12:18] This is the discount you'll get as paying with dash.

[12:23] So there's a lot of names that you guys

[12:26] would recognize pretty quickly off the back of this

[12:30] and varying discounts on those.

[12:34] Mainly, any major store, most major stores we've got.

[12:37] There's some that we don't have,

[12:38] which require direct approval or are directly

[12:41] not interested in accepting crypto.

[12:43] But otherwise, all of these will definitely be at launch.

[12:47] But yeah, there are some where we still have to work

[12:50] and negotiate and onboard with them

[12:52] to get that extra coverage.

[12:54] So yeah, that'll cover some of the discounts there.

[12:59] And at the bottom here, you'll see something interesting.

[13:01] We have a initial Visa eReward card system.

[13:05] So you will actually be able to buy a Visa gift card,

[13:10] which you could spend anywhere.

[13:12] And that can be added to Apple Pay and Google Pay.

[13:15] The one issue with that right now is it can't be topped up.

[13:17] So you would just buy up $200 and then spend it

[13:20] and then buy another eReward card.

[13:23] We are working on a Visa MasterCard style program,

[13:27] but that will be directly with an issuing bank

[13:30] and with Visa or MasterCard themselves

[13:32] as part of one of their pilot programs in the space.

[13:35] And that'll be, that's a more involved project.

[13:38] But for now, this will allow anyone to spend

[13:41] nearly anywhere using Dash.

[13:43] And they'll receive a little discount

[13:45] on that initial purchase and they can add it

[13:47] to Google Pay and Apple Pay.

[13:48] So pretty good coverage.

[13:51] - Yeah, so there's different percentages for all,

[13:54] but what is the thing that defines

[13:56] the specific percent for each?

[13:58] - It comes from the merchant.

[13:59] It comes from the merchant.

[14:01] So our profit margin is between the merchant's discount

[14:04] on their gift card and the discount

[14:08] that we provide to the customers.

[14:10] So we take a few, like a couple of percent,

[14:12] a few percent on each purchase.

[14:14] And that's where our revenue comes in.

[14:16] And then what we can offer back to the customers,

[14:19] that's what we offer back.

[14:20] So it's determined by the merchant.

[14:22] For some merchants, they'll be able to offer higher

[14:25] because their margins allow them to do so.

[14:27] And then for merchants like Amazon,

[14:28] they don't need to offer any discount on their gift card.

[14:30] So they don't like, unless you would be,

[14:33] unless we became a massive wholesale buyer.

[14:35] So over time we might be able to negotiate higher discounts

[14:38] and then offer that downwards.

[14:41] But yeah, it really just depends on merchant to merchant,

[14:44] how they discount their gift card program.

[14:46] - So are you, and by you, I mean CTX,

[14:50] working directly with merchants themselves,

[14:53] or is there a provider-

[14:53] - It's via partners.

[14:54] It's via sort of aggregated partners.

[14:56] So there is a communication with some of these merchants

[14:59] that goes via the partner or even directly in some cases,

[15:02] because they want to know who we are

[15:05] before they work with us,

[15:05] before they sign off on us being part of their program.

[15:09] And it's just a mix of providers.

[15:11] There are aggregators, I guess you would call them,

[15:14] sort of thing, and they work.

[15:16] Some of them power the existing programs

[15:18] that the merchants use.

[15:20] So they're actually powering the gift card systems

[15:22] in their point of sales,

[15:23] in which case they're a processor.

[15:24] And some of them are just kind of,

[15:27] they're just selling those gift cards

[15:29] as a reseller effectively.

[15:31] We become a reseller ourselves underneath them,

[15:34] and it's just a tiers of systems.

[15:39] Basically, there's a lot of...

[15:41] The reason this has taken longer than I would have liked

[15:43] is that there are a lot of third parties involved,

[15:46] and there are a lot of players in this,

[15:49] and things are moving and changing.

[15:51] There are regulatory concerns.

[15:52] There's a reason that Dash Direct left the space,

[15:54] and there has been a change in appetite,

[15:57] and managing that is obviously quite complex,

[16:00] managing lots of third parties,

[16:01] all with different APIs,

[16:03] and yeah, it's been a road.

[16:07] - Yeah.

[16:08] Okay.

[16:09] Can you tell us the difference between this,

[16:14] and now even the name of our former product

[16:18] that everybody was using is escaping me,

[16:21] but the one that Marshall was working on.

[16:24] - I'm saying Dash Direct.

[16:26] - Dash Direct.

[16:27] - Yeah, it's very similar.

[16:28] - What's the difference between this and Dash Direct?

[16:30] - Yeah, I mean, it's very similar.

[16:32] So it's a re-launch of a very similar service.

[16:38] For us, this is our core focus.

[16:40] For Marshall, it was a smaller part of a bigger business

[16:43] that you can risk a threat to via being exposed

[16:47] to crypto regulation, being a US-based entity.

[16:51] We're based in Canada,

[16:52] and we have different rules and focuses.

[16:55] We were powering payments for them for a long time,

[16:56] so this is our area of expertise.

[17:00] We've always existed in this crossover space

[17:02] between the incumbent financial services and crypto,

[17:07] so we're really comfortable here.

[17:09] It is effectively a very similar service.

[17:11] We're focused on launching more coverage,

[17:13] getting that visa.

[17:14] We want to expand to Canada and Europe

[17:17] towards the end of the year.

[17:18] Hopefully by the end of the year, it would be our goal.

[17:21] Canada's relatively soon.

[17:24] Europe would be right towards the end of the year.

[17:27] We do have partners that offer coverage there,

[17:29] but it's more the ancillary stuff

[17:32] around those partnerships and how that works,

[17:34] and the regulatory side there.

[17:38] And also, walking before we run.

[17:40] We have to maintain cash flow for all of these services.

[17:44] There's turnaround times between that,

[17:46] so we don't want to run out of funds

[17:48] to be able to buy cards,

[17:49] so it's just walking before we run, effectively,

[17:53] so just giving this time to bed in,

[17:55] learn anything, break things,

[17:57] and then iterate and expand, ultimately.

[18:01] Very similar is the answer to the question.

[18:03] Just, yeah, carrying on.

[18:06] Carrying on what Marshall Blake Foundation call that.

[18:10] - Okay, so speaking of gift cards,

[18:13] do the user experience from purchasing a gift card

[18:18] through this service, what will it be like?

[18:21] Will I have to register?

[18:25] Do I have to provide any personally identifying information?

[18:29] - We do take an email,

[18:32] because we're going to send you the gift card via email,

[18:34] as well as display it in-app.

[18:36] We do have kind of,

[18:37] there is a level of AML that we have to do,

[18:40] but it's very open-ended,

[18:43] because this is what's called a closed-loop product,

[18:45] rather than open-loop.

[18:46] The Visa isn't more of an open-loop,

[18:48] but the actual gift cards are closed-loop,

[18:51] because they're going to be spent on that specific merchant.

[18:54] It has different sort of regulatory concerns.

[18:57] We do ask for an email address,

[18:59] we use, I guess, to educate accounts,

[19:02] and use it as sort of a unique identifier for our account.

[19:05] And yeah, that's the only thing we really ask for.

[19:07] So you enter in your email,

[19:09] we send you a code to verify that email

[19:11] as part of your login flow.

[19:13] And then when you make a purchase,

[19:15] you'll pay with Dash, as usual,

[19:18] deep into the Dash wallet,

[19:19] or directly within the Dash wallet

[19:22] for the integrated version.

[19:24] And you'll instantly get spit back a barcode,

[19:26] or an alphanumeric code,

[19:29] which is your gift card.

[19:30] And you can either display that to the merchant,

[19:32] enter it on the web checkout,

[19:33] or yeah, otherwise, they can scan the barcode, obviously,

[19:37] but you might have to read it out to them

[19:39] if they don't have a tool to scan the barcode.

[19:41] And that will complete your purchase.

[19:42] It's all instant, it all comes through very quickly.

[19:45] So you'd be able to just do it at the tilt, effectively,

[19:49] when you're checking out.

[19:50] - And sorry, did you say that the code

[19:53] must go to an email, or may go?

[19:56] Can it go directly to the merchant?

[19:57] - It can also go to email.

[19:58] No, so it automatically goes to the app in the,

[20:01] yeah, it'll display directly from the app,

[20:04] the email, it's like the backup form.

[20:05] It's also, in terms of giving customer support,

[20:07] we need to be able to kind of verify you are,

[20:09] who you say you are.

[20:11] You know, I had this issue buying this,

[20:12] and if we don't have anything to associate between,

[20:15] other than a Dash address,

[20:16] then we'd have to, like, get used to, like,

[20:17] a signed message with the Dash address,

[20:19] which becomes a lot more complex and involved.

[20:22] In the future, I do want to move towards

[20:24] using sort of a Dash address on the mobile wallet,

[20:28] be like the first address from the HD wallet,

[20:31] sort of context zero, or whatever,

[20:33] and use that as the user,

[20:35] and they would effectively be able to

[20:37] redeem a code to prove that who they are, who they are.

[20:40] They would be able to say, you know,

[20:42] "This is my customer support code."

[20:43] It would be like six digits,

[20:45] kind of like using a two-letter code dedication.

[20:48] That would be where I'd like to go in the future with this.

[20:50] Obviously, if we do introduce a Visa MasterCard,

[20:54] Marshall was keen to try and introduce one

[20:55] without any KYC.

[20:57] I don't think that's a realistic option these days.

[21:01] And if we introduce a full Visa MasterCard solution,

[21:04] it will be full, you know,

[21:06] standard KYC side of things,

[21:08] in terms of liveness check and proof of address and ID.

[21:13] So that's just necessary to work with those others.

[21:17] - Okay, so Visa would have KYC AML.

[21:21] Gift cards would not?

[21:22] - Gift cards won't, no, ever.

[21:25] - Okay, and in terms of other applications

[21:29] integrating with the service,

[21:31] how would that work from a developer standpoint?

[21:34] - Yeah, so obviously we have our API right now.

[21:36] It'd be like an approval basis

[21:39] where we'll actually give keys,

[21:40] but it's relatively simple to use.

[21:42] You wouldn't necessarily need an API key

[21:46] for anything but our merchant data,

[21:48] because that is the location data that we have,

[21:50] because that's more proprietary,

[21:52] but the actual purchase flow,

[21:54] we can open the API up,

[21:56] because anyone can actually see

[21:57] what their browser is doing in terms of the requests

[21:59] and do the same thing if they wanted.

[22:01] So that's not particularly sensitive.

[22:04] Again, it would go through that flow

[22:05] where you would authenticate the user.

[22:08] So you would provide us with an email.

[22:11] We'll ping back a code to that user.

[22:13] You'll then provide that code

[22:15] and would then return with a bearer token,

[22:18] which is for that user's use

[22:19] and has an expiry and renewal.

[22:21] And then you would use all the future requests.

[22:23] You would just use the bearer token

[22:24] and that thing on behalf of the user.

[22:27] - Okay, but in terms of the Dash wallet,

[22:31] users in the Dash wallet don't have an email.

[22:34] So how does that work?

[22:36] - You just enter an email as part of the flow

[22:38] and ping off a code.

[22:40] So you enter an email and then go to the next step

[22:42] and it'll ask you for the one-time authentication code

[22:45] that's sent to your email.

[22:46] And then from there on, it will remember you.

[22:49] - Okay, now are you working with a Dash core group

[22:52] to get this integrated already?

[22:54] And do they have-

[22:54] - It's already ready.

[22:56] It's largely, you know, ready to go.

[22:59] Our last stage sort of testing, you know,

[23:01] maybe they built a system for Marshall a long time ago.

[23:05] Alex worked, my co-founder Alex worked on

[23:08] actually getting it working with our API,

[23:10] which has minor changes from Marshall's.

[23:14] But yeah, everything is pretty much ready to go there.

[23:17] You know, I would say it's a hundred percent

[23:18] because we need to do the last sort of mild testing

[23:20] in terms of end-to-end purchase flows,

[23:22] but we've done all test net flows.

[23:24] We've managed to get, you know,

[23:26] gift cards displayed in the wallet.

[23:28] We managed to get the map updated

[23:29] with all of our merchant location data.

[23:32] So yeah, that's all.

[23:33] It's very much ready and we're very keen to launch.

[23:37] Obviously there is this third-party blocker

[23:39] that we're just hoping will be resolved this week

[23:43] that we can launch.

[23:44] - This week?

[23:46] That was, you know, I'm obligated to ask the win question.

[23:50] So I guess-

[23:51] - So we're hoping the third-party blocker

[23:54] will be resolved this week.

[23:56] And then I'm not sure,

[23:58] I can't speak for DCG sort of delivery timelines

[24:00] on the mobile wallet.

[24:02] I can, we can get a basic web app working

[24:05] to get people testing this in a couple of weeks

[24:08] following that, really.

[24:09] So there will be a usable version.

[24:12] However, beta, alpha, whatever you want to call it

[24:16] within a few weeks,

[24:17] if that third-party blocker is resolved,

[24:20] which it should be.

[24:21] It sounds like such a simple problem.

[24:23] I'm really hoping they'll just come back to me today,

[24:25] tomorrow, at some point this week and say,

[24:28] "Yeah, we've sorted it.

[24:29] We've whitelisted your ID."

[24:30] We will see, I guess.

[24:34] - Okay, well, that's great.

[24:36] A month, I would say, is probably something good

[24:39] that people can plan on based on what you've said.

[24:42] Anthony, do you have any questions?

[24:45] - High-level questions.

[24:46] I know that a couple of people in the Discord

[24:49] had some questions,

[24:50] but I don't know if they ended up asking those

[24:54] in the channel.

[24:54] So I'll look for those while you ask any questions.

[24:57] - Yeah, I was gonna say, once it is out,

[25:01] where will people find it?

[25:02] What should they search for?

[25:04] - Yeah, I've been sharing URLs and things,

[25:07] but the goal, I would like to have it hosted

[25:09] under a Dash or subdomain.

[25:11] So really, this is a Dash service,

[25:13] so it'll be spend.dash or something like that,

[25:16] the actual web app.

[25:18] And then for the mobile apps,

[25:19] they'll just be available on Google Play,

[25:22] and the Apple App Store.

[25:24] The version Apple will take a little bit longer.

[25:27] I know it won't be in the full wallet,

[25:28] the Dash core version of the full wallet quite well,

[25:32] but the iOS wallet,

[25:33] but it will be in the Android wallet relatively quickly.

[25:37] Same for our standalone apps.

[25:38] We're building them in React Native,

[25:39] so they will be available on both,

[25:41] but I imagine it's gonna take us

[25:43] a little bit longer to get the approval

[25:44] on the iOS App Store.

[25:47] So it'll be Android first,

[25:48] and then it would be the, yeah.

[25:50] - All right.

[25:55] Well, I think that's a pretty good update on all that.

[26:01] Did you have anything else?

[26:05] It's been a while since we chatted.

[26:07] Just anything else that you wanted to comment on?

[26:12] - Nothing major, no.

[26:13] I think, you know,

[26:14] obviously we're really keen to have testers on this.

[26:16] So when we do launch it,

[26:18] I do expect, like I do expect,

[26:20] I hope people will hammer it and break things

[26:22] and give us feedback,

[26:23] and we can make those improvements where,

[26:25] you know, we have tested it a lot,

[26:26] but we're gonna get all the family and friends

[26:28] and people to test it that we can,

[26:30] but the more people throwing stuff at it, the better.

[26:33] - Right now it's US only, right?

[26:36] - It will be US only initially,

[26:38] then relatively quick expansion to Canada,

[26:40] and then there's more that are expanded to Europe.

[26:43] Hopefully, towards the end of the year,

[26:45] we'll be a couple of years in.

[26:47] Likewise, I would love to get a full

[26:50] Visa MasterCard solution in by December,

[26:52] hit that Christmas sort of bump,

[26:54] but we will see how that goes.

[26:57] With regards to this directory,

[26:58] obviously first we're just doing the CTX stuff

[27:02] and the existing merchant database,

[27:05] which came from Discover Dash,

[27:06] and it's now in the mobile wallet, and ATMs.

[27:08] So we'll be doing ATMs,

[27:10] so we're gonna be scraping for third parties,

[27:12] CoinATM, Radar, that sort of thing.

[27:14] And there'll be a full ATM app in there as well.

[27:17] BitRefill will be relatively easy to, at top level,

[27:22] provide links offsite on a merchant page.

[27:24] So if you went to, you know, dash spend slash Best Buy,

[27:27] you'll be able to see that you can purchase directly

[27:29] with CTX and get a discount,

[27:30] or you can go up to BitRefill,

[27:32] but there'll be more merchants that BitRefill

[27:34] have coverage for that we don't at this stage.

[27:37] So they'll have their own sort of listings on there,

[27:39] which just say, you know, available on BitRefill.

[27:44] Click here to maybe purchase,

[27:45] and it'll send you off to BitRefill.

[27:48] - Just one more question

[27:49] from the user experience standpoint.

[27:51] Do you expect this to be a service

[27:53] where somebody is standing in a line,

[27:56] they get the exact price of what's being charged,

[28:01] can they buy the gift card for that exact amount?

[28:04] - Yes, yeah, yeah.

[28:06] I think for most merchants,

[28:08] it will work that way effectively.

[28:11] I think some, there will be a level of clunkiness,

[28:14] like gift cards on a polished system

[28:17] in their own right for some merchants.

[28:20] For a lot of merchants, you'll be able to go in,

[28:22] you'll be able to make a purchase at Subway,

[28:23] you'll see your total is like $11.53.

[28:26] They'll enter that in.

[28:27] You might only pay $10.20 or whatever it is

[28:29] with our discount.

[28:30] It won't be that high, it'll be still more than that,

[28:32] but you know what I mean?

[28:33] And then you'll get a barcode.

[28:35] You'll show the merchant, they'll enter,

[28:37] they'll discover the barcode,

[28:38] and they'll be happy to purchase complete.

[28:41] So, and it will be instant in terms of,

[28:44] next instant, near instant, let's say,

[28:47] in terms of procuring a gift card.

[28:49] Obviously, you'd have to have the internet available,

[28:52] mobile data to make that purchase and get that gift card,

[28:55] but yeah, I find it to be instant.

[28:58] - Okay.

[29:00] All right, well, I think with that,

[29:01] I think we'll wrap it up.

[29:03] Unless anybody else has any other questions or comments.

[29:07] Anthony, you good?

[29:09] - Just one thing I was kind of curious.

[29:10] I saw that a lot of the places you could get gift cards for

[29:13] are places you would have like a monthly

[29:16] or like yearly subscription to,

[29:18] like Uber Eats or something like that.

[29:21] Is that something that would be a possibility also?

[29:24] - Yeah, so you can top up your accounts ultimately

[29:26] with these things, with any of the Amazon side of things.

[29:30] You can just load up your account.

[29:31] You don't have to do it directly

[29:33] as part of a purchase flow with Netflix.

[29:36] Obviously, Uber people are gonna be using it for Uber Eats

[29:38] as well as ride sharing,

[29:40] and they can top up their accounts,

[29:42] use that to buy a Uber one.

[29:44] So yeah, anything like that,

[29:45] I think Hulu is on there as well.

[29:48] There are a lot of options

[29:49] where it's kind of a non-standard purchase.

[29:51] You might think, hey, I can't use a gift card for this,

[29:53] but you can, you know,

[29:55] the other thing that we'll be looking at doing soon

[29:57] is the whole phone top up side of things,

[29:59] which is a different sort of space

[30:02] within the same sort of world.

[30:05] So yeah, that's the other thing.

[30:06] But yeah, a lot of those merchants

[30:08] will allow you the ability to just sort of

[30:10] top up your account and let it deduct from that account.

[30:14] - Okay, cool.

[30:16] You know, it seems like this is huge

[30:19] for connecting us to the wider commerce world.

[30:22] - It's just a lot of utility, you know?

[30:24] I don't say, some people, you know,

[30:26] would think, oh yeah,

[30:28] you can use Dash at all these stores,

[30:29] and that's great, you can,

[30:30] but the merchant isn't directly accepting them.

[30:32] They're accepting it via their gift card program.

[30:34] And I think this is a really important in-between step,

[30:37] but the long-term goal is to make this kind of redundant

[30:40] because merchants are directly accepting crypto,

[30:43] which is a funny position to be in,

[30:45] that your goal is to be redundant,

[30:46] but thankfully we have the other side of the business,

[30:47] which is that direct acceptance.

[30:49] So, you know, there is a nice sort of segue

[30:52] into from one to the other.

[30:53] I think the utility and the ability to live on Dash,

[30:57] like Joel, and to actually use your masternode earnings

[31:00] or your yield from your interest

[31:02] or from your bond on Maya network,

[31:05] and spend that to pay for your day-to-day goods,

[31:08] rather than going for this cash outflow is great too.

[31:12] And, you know, people that work for the incubator

[31:13] could use this to, you know, spend on their purchasing

[31:16] without having to go through that longer-term

[31:18] sort of cash outflow and could actually feel more utility

[31:22] from the Dash that they're holding.

[31:25] - Yeah, well, that's what I'm always looking for is,

[31:29] you know, when we pay people Dash in the incubator

[31:31] and it's always easier to attract developers,

[31:34] attract especially new people,

[31:37] if you have that go-to solution where you can say,

[31:40] after you do X and Y task and you get paid this Dash,

[31:44] you can then directly use it as easy as, you know,

[31:49] three clicks and now you have a gift card

[31:52] at a store that you typically shop at.

[31:55] So that does help.

[31:56] I know a lot of people are looking forward to this.

[31:59] A lot of people were very excited about the Dash Direct

[32:04] and were very bummed when it got-

[32:08] - It had a lot of use.

[32:09] It was a very quickly successful product.

[32:12] Like we've powered the payments for quite a while.

[32:14] We know the volumes that they were doing.

[32:15] It was really popular and it was a knock to the ecosystem

[32:19] to watch that.

[32:20] So we're, you know, it's taken us longer than we'd like,

[32:23] but we're glad to be launching this very soon.

[32:26] And I think it's also good for developers as well.

[32:29] You know, this is a way to offer, you know,

[32:32] nicer sort of onboarding to users in a way

[32:35] where they can say, oh, I can just redeem this

[32:37] as a, you know, $100 Amazon gift card,

[32:39] instead of worrying about the Dash side of things initially.

[32:42] And then just lots of extra utility.

[32:46] - Yep. All right.

[32:50] Well, we're looking forward to that.

[32:52] We won't bug you for at least a month or so.

[32:54] And we'll-

[32:56] - I'll keep you updated.

[32:57] I will.

[32:58] And all the public channels.

[32:59] - Now, Anthony, we are continuing with our streams

[33:04] this week, I believe.

[33:04] I think we have at least one scheduled for Thursday

[33:08] to do the Dash platform testing.

[33:10] So that will probably be the next time

[33:12] that you see us on the incubator.

[33:15] And other than that, we'll see you next week.

[33:17] All righty.

[33:19] Bye, bye.
