Rion's Dash incubator proposal is split into two proposals to align priorities between contributors and voters for more targeted feedback.

## Episode Summary

In this episode, Rion discusses the recent changes to his Dash incubator proposal, which has been split into two separate proposals. The first proposal focuses on recruiting 10-20 new developers to experiment with Dash, while the second proposal, submitted by Jojobyte, focuses on a new library called Dash proposal.js. Rion emphasizes the importance of bringing Dash features to the JavaScript ecosystem and making the proposal process easier to increase competition and attract more developers and entrepreneurs to the Dash ecosystem.

## Chapters

00:00 - Introduction and overview of the episode's topic: quality vs quantity in Rion's Dash incubator

The episode starts with a brief introduction and an overview of the main topic, which is the balance between quality and quantity in Rion's Dash incubator. Rion mentions that the show will be shorter than usual and will primarily focus on updates to the incubator's proposals.

01:20 - Explanation of the episode's title and its relevance to Rion's Dash incubator strategy

Rion explains the meaning behind the episode's title, "Quality - Quantity," and how it relates to his incubator's strategy. He discusses the history of the incubator's focus, initially emphasizing quantity to attract developers and later shifting to quality by working with a smaller team on important projects. Now, Rion believes it's time to shift back to a more quantitative approach to find new talent and increase adoption.

03:57 - Discussion on the importance of user adoption and the need for a quantitative approach

Rion discusses the importance of user adoption, stating that even high-quality products are not useful if nobody is using them. He emphasizes the need for a quantitative approach to attract more developers and users to the Dash ecosystem, as the current user base is not large enough despite the quality of the products.

07:09 - Explanation of the recent changes to Rion's Dash incubator proposals

Rion explains the recent changes to his incubator's proposals, which have been split into two separate proposals to provide more granular information to the voters. This change aims to align priorities between contributors and voters and give voters more visibility into the work being done by the contributors.

15:33 - The importance of focusing on the JavaScript ecosystem for the success of Dash

Rion discusses the importance of focusing on the JavaScript ecosystem for the success of Dash, as most applications are built using JavaScript. He emphasizes the need to bring Dash features, such as CoinJoin, to the JavaScript ecosystem to make it easier for developers to integrate Dash into their applications.

20:56 - Rion's strategy for recruiting new developers and increasing the quantity of contributors

Rion outlines his strategy for recruiting 10-20 new developers to experiment with Dash and its offerings. He plans to work with Anthony to reach out to developers both within the incubator's channels and through other channels to increase visibility. The goal is to find developers who can provide value to the Dash ecosystem and potentially submit their own proposals for funding.

27:30 - Discussion on the potential for a bounty system or request for proposal (RFP) platform

Rion and Anthony discuss the potential for implementing a bounty system or an RFP platform to make it easier for masternode owners to request specific projects or features. They consider the benefits of having a list of predefined tasks that developers can choose from, rather than requiring them to come up with their own ideas for proposals.

32:54 - Conclusion and final thoughts on the importance of the circular flow of funds in the Dash ecosystem

Rion concludes the episode by reiterating the importance of the circular flow of funds in the Dash ecosystem. He emphasizes that the primary market, where Dash is created and distributed to contributors, should be spent through the project's partners to maintain a sustainable economy. Rion also addresses questions from the audience regarding the types of proposals that can be submitted and encourages the community to bring forth their ideas.

## Transcript

[00:00] We are live.

[00:04] It is showtime.

[00:05] Welcome everybody to our Incubator Weekly Show today.

[00:10] It's going to be a little bit of a shorter show today.

[00:12] I actually do think that that's going to be true because we don't have much to cover

[00:17] today.

[00:18] I do want to talk about our proposal updates and first I wanted to start out by just saying

[00:27] hello, Anthony.

[00:28] How are you doing today?

[00:29] Hello, I'm doing good.

[00:31] How was your Mother's Day?

[00:34] Yeah, it was good.

[00:36] I was just, yeah, we spent the day mostly with my in-laws but my mom has nine children

[00:42] so I try not to, I called her and I left a message because she didn't answer it because

[00:50] probably was talking with somebody else.

[00:52] Anyway, moving right along to, let's see, I got to add this to the stage.

[00:59] Moving right along to the topic of today, Anthony, can you give me a yes or no?

[01:09] Can you see my screen?

[01:10] Are we good?

[01:11] Are we good there?

[01:12] You're good, yeah.

[01:13] All right, so if anybody's not familiar with this notation, quality and quantity is the

[01:20] topic but these little notations, it's a little bit of a music trivia so if we have any music

[01:26] fans in the group watching the show here, you'll probably know what this is but these

[01:33] are signs for repeats.

[01:35] So in music notation, you have notes and measures and if you have this, these little two little

[01:45] dots.

[02:08] What I mean by this is last week, so it's a bit of a follow-on from our last week's

[02:13] discussion and that topic was developers, developers, developers.

[02:21] So a little bit of a history of how the incubator has gone so far.

[02:26] In the beginning, we focused a lot on the quantity of developers.

[02:33] So we had, we have a big Trello board and we were just, basically we were trying to

[02:38] get a lot of developers doing a lot of different things and that was good.

[02:45] We got hundreds, I would say, of developers looking at Dash and trying it out over the

[02:52] course of the years and it was a little bit overwhelming for me at a certain point to

[02:59] where I shifted from quantity to focusing more on quality and shrinking the quantity

[03:06] down to a few developers that I knew were good, knew had high quality potential and

[03:14] I focused on a few projects that was, that were, I thought were very important to get

[03:23] some quality products done in, specifically in the JavaScript ecosystem.

[03:31] And I think that we're at the point now where I want to shift my strategic focus to back

[03:40] to quantity.

[03:43] There are several reasons for this, but one of those reasons is simply that we can build

[03:50] the highest quality product that we want, but if nobody's using it, what good is it?

[03:57] And I do think that we have a very high quality product in Dash, both in general, our payments

[04:04] technology, our payments product, which is the main focus of Dash is peer-to-peer payments.

[04:11] And I think that we do that well.

[04:12] I think that we do that better than any crypto project out there, including the integrations

[04:18] that we have thanks to different organizations within Dash.

[04:25] We've got just a lot of integrations coupled with the fact that we've been doing this for

[04:30] over a decade.

[04:31] I think now it's close, yeah, over a decade now in Dash.

[04:39] But we do need to do better with the quantity of both developers and users.

[04:46] There are just not enough people that are trying these products, seeing what it has

[04:53] to offer, and I think we need to fix that.

[04:57] So both in common here is saying so many high quality products have no users.

[05:06] So many of them.

[05:07] Yeah.

[05:08] I got to shift back.

[05:09] I'm going to shift back over to our stream here so I can see.

[05:12] Yeah, let's shift this as well.

[05:15] Yeah.

[05:16] So I agree with that.

[05:19] Do you have any examples?

[05:21] There are a lot of examples in the past.

[05:23] I think people kind of know about this, but do you have any examples of two competing

[05:28] products, Anthony, that one was higher quality clearly, but just didn't have the users?

[05:33] Well, for something that I would think of, and I wouldn't say necessarily one is obviously

[05:38] higher quality than the other, but I feel like for me, Redwood.js as an open source

[05:43] project, I felt like always had very high quality with very low quality kind of notoriety

[05:52] and usage in terms of the open source world, compared to things like Next or Remix.

[05:58] And I felt that it was certainly as good, and in my opinion, there are things that made

[06:03] it better, but it never really was able to quite get the same sort of attention that

[06:09] those other ones got.

[06:11] So this definitely happens in open source, and I'm trying to think in terms of like other

[06:18] --

[06:19] Anyway, I don't want to put you on the spot there, but if you come up with any, just feel

[06:22] free.

[06:23] But I think --

[06:24] Edgeo.

[06:25] So again --

[06:26] Edgeo, the company I worked at, Edgeo, that's a deployment platform kind of had a similar

[06:29] problem.

[06:30] Yeah.

[06:31] Yeah.

[06:32] And there's something also to be said for, if your product doesn't really have users,

[06:36] was it really high quality in the first place?

[06:38] So I don't know.

[06:39] It is definitely a question of strategy and how much you focus on building great things

[06:47] and how much you focus on marketing.

[06:48] So there's something to be said there.

[06:50] I'm personally not a big marketing guy, but I recognize the importance of that.

[06:58] But anyway, I do want to shift now to just jumping into the proposals that Incubator

[07:07] has up, and there's been some changes.

[07:09] So I wanted to make sure that everybody understood, everybody understands the changes and why

[07:21] we're doing that.

[07:24] And by we, I mostly mean me and the few developers that I was focusing on with, AJ and Jojo Byte

[07:31] and you, Anthony.

[07:33] That's kind of like my solid base team right now.

[07:38] And we've split what used to be one proposal under my name into now two proposals.

[07:45] And I want to go through why we've done that.

[07:49] So I'm going to just quickly pan through the text of the proposal so that anybody watching

[07:54] can read that and see what our proposal, this is the body of our proposal, what it used

[08:03] to be.

[08:04] I didn't change the body of the proposal at all.

[08:06] I figured it would just be easier and more transparent to keep the proposal as it was,

[08:13] but then make an update in the comments.

[08:17] And I'll let people read this on their own time.

[08:21] I won't read it word for word, but I'll just talk about these three main, actually probably

[08:26] just the two main topics here, the split proposals and the priority updates.

[08:34] The context, you can read that if you want as well.

[08:37] I think it's important context.

[08:41] Basically the main thing with that context is that I feel like there are still the vast

[08:45] majority of the Dash community supports what we're doing, but yeah, our proposal was very

[08:54] close to passing last month, but it didn't.

[08:57] And I'm hoping that this proposal passes this month, and I'll go ahead and read this.

[09:06] So step in the right direction is providing more granular proposals.

[09:10] So this will help align priorities between contributors and voters by giving voters more

[09:16] visibility into what contributors are working on and hopefully giving contributors more

[09:19] targeted feedback from voters.

[09:21] Accordingly, Jojobite has submitted a separate proposal that will primarily cover his Kool

[09:27] Age 86's work.

[09:31] And then we'll go through that proposal briefly after we do this one.

[09:36] But in Dash, what I've noticed is the best way to get real feedback is to just put things

[09:42] up for the vote and see where the votes go.

[09:46] It's a bit like the entrepreneurial process where it's not so much about going out and

[09:55] asking, doing customer surveys about what they want.

[10:00] Like the old adage goes, they'll tell you they want faster horses kind of thing.

[10:04] But you have to just put products out into the market and see if they pass.

[10:08] And that's what they pass the market test.

[10:11] And that's kind of what we're doing here is we're just saying, okay, we're going to split

[10:16] these proposals up so that I can see, are people happy with or unhappy with what I personally

[10:24] am doing and the direction that I want to go with you, Anthony?

[10:29] Or are people more, do they want to continue funding Kool Age 86's and Jojobite's work?

[10:41] Where's the value?

[10:44] What's the priority here, if not both?

[10:47] And I hope both, because that's what I'm going to talk about.

[10:50] I think that we both kind of need each other in terms of how this fits together for the

[10:56] good of Dash itself.

[10:58] Any questions so far or comments, Anthony?

[11:01] Can we look at Jojo's?

[11:04] What's that?

[11:05] Can we look at Jojo's proposal?

[11:07] Yes.

[11:08] Yes.

[11:09] Okay.

[11:10] Okay.

[11:11] So, this is, so he's requesting 400 Dash for two months.

[11:19] And I mentioned in my text that that would basically make up for the 800 Dash that was

[11:25] not funded last quarter.

[11:28] And I know that I don't say that in the sense that like, oh, we really need that back.

[11:35] I'm just saying that in the sense that I basically requested what I thought was the minimum to

[11:41] keep these high-quality developers funded as well as my own efforts and yours and reaching

[11:47] out to other people.

[11:50] And if people want that, then the proposal was so close to passing that I kind of wonder

[11:57] if it was just a matter of timing or whatnot.

[12:00] And I want to give MNOs the opportunity to fund that if they value those efforts.

[12:06] So, here's the body of the proposal.

[12:11] The main focus for these two is finishing the Dash join.js library and starting a new

[12:20] library called Dash proposal.js.

[12:24] And yeah, I'll talk a little bit about that as well.

[12:29] Otherwise we'll do that now.

[12:31] The Dash join stuff, this is, I think, important work.

[12:34] I would guess that most people would think this would be important as well.

[12:43] Coin join is one of our most important features, providing privacy for normal users to have

[12:52] normal private cash-like transactions, just like we've always had for the past 100, 200

[12:57] whatever years that we've been using cash.

[13:00] So preserving that in the digital age is extremely important.

[13:06] Another thing that you have noticed, Anthony, and everybody I'm sure has noticed, is that

[13:14] I focus on the JavaScript ecosystem.

[13:18] And the reason for that is that most applications are built with JavaScript.

[13:23] And for better or for worse, I think there was a comment, I do read every comment that

[13:30] comes through, and I appreciate every comment that comes through.

[13:34] And one of the comments that I saw, actually, I guess it was, was it in this proposal?

[13:41] Must have been in this proposal.

[13:43] So I'll continue going through here.

[13:48] JavaScript is not a safe language.

[13:50] You better give up.

[13:52] So that's hilarious.

[13:53] A lot to say about this, but I mean, you cannot deny the fact that JavaScript has been the

[14:04] most influential and important programming paradigm in the past two decades.

[14:13] There are more JavaScript developers and more applications built in JavaScript than any

[14:18] other language, probably all other languages combined, I would guess.

[14:22] So not going to debate that.

[14:24] It's very hard to avoid.

[14:26] Yeah.

[14:27] Yeah.

[14:28] So whether it's safe or not, you know, it's effective.

[14:31] I don't mean to sound like a vaccination commercial, but if it's not safe, it's definitely effective

[14:38] because it's everywhere.

[14:40] JavaScript is literally in pretty much every environment.

[14:43] Yeah, you can also argue, even if it's not, even if it's not safe or effective, it's just

[14:49] what you have to use, like, unless you want to do the whole WebAssembly thing.

[14:54] Yeah.

[14:55] And, you know, the people have been saying that for a decade also, is that WebAssembly

[14:59] is going to come in and eat everybody's lunch and we won't be using JavaScript anymore.

[15:03] It's just not happening.

[15:04] It won't be happening anytime soon.

[15:06] So focusing on the JavaScript ecosystem is paramount to success.

[15:11] Making great tools in this ecosystem.

[15:15] So that's why we want to bring our features to JavaScript, including CoinJoin.

[15:21] This next one is very important for my strategy going forward, which I haven't really discussed,

[15:26] but I'll go back to that in a minute.

[15:28] Actually, I'll go back to that right now.

[15:33] Back in this comment.

[15:34] So priority updates.

[15:37] Jojobite's proposal is 400 Dash per month for two months.

[15:41] I covered this a little bit.

[15:43] I'll skip ahead to, yeah, Anthony and I would focus on recruiting additional Web 2 and Web

[15:51] 3 developers to explore Dash platform and Dash in general.

[15:55] By the end of the quarter, we'll invite 10 to 20 devs to experiment with Dash's offerings,

[16:00] platform, wallets, partner integrations, including like Sprits, things like that.

[16:04] We'd like to do this both on the incubator channels as well as other channels for increased

[16:09] visibility.

[16:10] So this is the idea is, I think that we need to shift into more of a quantitative approach.

[16:18] And through that quantitative approach, and that's kind of how you find the quality as

[16:23] well.

[16:24] So it's not like ship degrading quality in favor of quantity.

[16:29] It's a repeat process, right?

[16:31] That's the whole idea with that title is that you, sometimes you focus on a small team that

[16:36] builds a quality product, and then you bring it out and you have other people test that

[16:41] product and see what they can do to improve it.

[16:44] You expand the scope and quantity so that then later you can find, oh, we discovered

[16:50] these two developers that are, they didn't know about Dash.

[16:53] And the fact that we gave them an opportunity to try it out, even paid them to compensate

[17:01] for their time to try it out.

[17:04] And now they just love it and can't get enough of it.

[17:07] And now they're contributing in a way that they would have never contributed before had

[17:12] we not broadened our scope, widened our nets, and tried to bring in more people, more developers,

[17:19] more users.

[17:20] So this is the season for that, I think, is...

[17:23] Yeah.

[17:24] There's a comment here.

[17:25] I can just read it to you, "Mass adoption is the thing now, especially with rising world

[17:29] population.

[17:30] If you just focused on quality, it might never happen."

[17:33] Yeah.

[17:34] Yep.

[17:35] Good comment.

[17:36] "Rising world population for now."

[17:42] Also it's not only about rising world population.

[17:46] I don't exactly know where that fits in because I feel like the population has always been

[17:49] increasing, but right now we're in an economic time where there are a lot of people out of

[17:55] work.

[17:56] There are going to be even more people out of work.

[17:58] I see the writing on the wall, unemployment figures, they're by all official metrics are

[18:05] still very low right now, but I think those numbers are fake.

[18:13] And the unemployment, especially in software right now, is significantly worse than the

[18:21] official numbers say, and I think it's going to get worse.

[18:24] So one thing that we can do is we can capitalize on that opportunity by saying, "Hey, you might

[18:29] not have a job right now, but we can throw you 10, 20, 50 dash, try out this product,

[18:39] see if you can do something with it, see if you can provide value back to this economy,

[18:47] and put in your own proposal to get more funding if you'd like."

[18:52] So offering jobs is the best way to gain users, I think, because not only do you gain a user,

[19:00] which in and of itself is something that companies pay a lot of money for to acquire users, and

[19:06] there's different metrics about how much money a company can and should spend to acquire

[19:11] a new user, but it can be hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, depending on the industry

[19:19] that you want to spend to acquire a user.

[19:23] But the benefit to the proposal process and giving somebody the opportunity to propose

[19:32] a quality product is that you don't only get a user out of that, you also get a contributor

[19:38] out of that, a worker, somebody that brings value to the ecosystem.

[19:42] And then that filters down, and everybody that receives Dash from what I call the primary

[19:49] market, the treasury, the superblock system, they're going to want to spend that Dash.

[19:55] And where are they going to spend that?

[19:56] Through our partners.

[19:57] So that's what I do.

[20:00] So pretty much all the money that I earn is going through one or more of our partners

[20:06] and sustaining them as well.

[20:08] So I think that's an important part as well, and we need to expand that so that our partners

[20:12] continue to get funding.

[20:15] Anything to say about that before I continue on, Anthony?

[20:20] Free to just jump in, because I'm in monologue mode right now.

[20:24] No, you're good.

[20:25] Yeah, no, I think it makes a lot of sense, you know, you want to, as you get more people

[20:30] involved, you get the flywheel, and the more funds are given to people that they can spend,

[20:36] like you know, get the "Dash economy" moving.

[20:40] Yeah, money talks, right?

[20:41] I mean, that's the old phrase.

[20:44] That's what people want.

[20:45] They want to earn money, and if they can provide value, then that's a win-win, right, for everybody.

[20:52] So 10 to 20 devs, that's my target.

[20:56] I'm confident in this number.

[20:58] Anthony, do you think that we can present this to 10 to 20 new developers?

[21:04] So my theory behind that is, you know, just even, we could do five a week, and it would

[21:11] only take two to four weeks to do that once every weekday.

[21:16] So I think this is a pretty easy target.

[21:20] We know a lot of developers between the two of us, so.

[21:24] Yeah, I think the interesting thing for me, like I've been reaching out to some people

[21:28] already, and I think I need to hone the kind of pitch I'm giving them, because usually

[21:33] the first response I'm getting back is like, "Oh, well, I don't know anything about crypto,

[21:37] so I don't know if I'm right for this."

[21:39] But I'm like, "Well, that's the point, though."

[21:41] It's like, we're looking for people who may not necessarily be in the crypto world, trying

[21:45] to get their feedback to see if we can get you into this world.

[21:48] Yep, yep, yep, exactly.

[21:51] So I'm going to jump back over to Jojobite's proposal.

[21:54] That's the reason that this, that's one of the reasons why this dash proposal.js library

[21:59] is important, in my opinion.

[22:01] Right now, and you know, I'm still planning on doing this proposal thing where I create

[22:08] a proposal and show the process.

[22:11] But the bottom line with that is that I think that the process is too difficult right now.

[22:15] It's at least, it's not too difficult to figure out, obviously, you can figure it out.

[22:20] I figured it out, and many other people have figured it out, and you can do that.

[22:25] But why limit ourselves when we have all the tools now, which we've built, we've built

[22:31] a bunch of JavaScript libraries to make this fairly easy, and AJ in particular could probably

[22:38] make this library rather quickly, by the end of the quarter, I'm guessing, would be very

[22:44] easily doable.

[22:47] And the idea is that every, every one of the, and I'll just actually bring some of these

[22:52] up on the fly here.

[22:55] Let's see, proposal.dash.org is the place to go for submitting a proposal, creating

[23:03] and submitting a proposal.

[23:05] And there's another one that I want to highlight as well, mnowatch.org/, I'm going to, let's

[23:21] see.

[23:24] Some lagging going on here.

[23:27] I'll let that catch up in a minute.

[23:31] Okay.

[23:32] Let's see.

[23:33] Proposal generator.

[23:34] So, these are two fairly simple ways to start a proposal.

[23:39] But it's only simple if you have some context about how to, about how to do this in the

[23:48] first place.

[23:49] So, they're simple for somebody who already knows the process, is what I'm saying.

[23:53] Because what you do here is you just, you give some proposal, like my proposal, my prop,

[24:02] and then you put in some information here.

[24:07] This is probably going to have some kind of validation, so I'm going to bring up an insight

[24:11] explorer to get a valid dash address as well.

[24:19] Let's see.

[24:20] Let's just check one of these blocks here.

[24:24] Oh, look at that, a coin join transaction, nice, random.

[24:41] And payment amount, say one dash, and create proposal.

[24:47] So, what this does is it gives you a command string and you're supposed to then copy this

[24:56] and paste it into the desktop wallet.

[25:00] Now, the desktop wallet requires whatever it is, 40 gigabytes of data and several hours

[25:08] of downloading.

[25:11] And now you've lost some people.

[25:14] And arguably, you haven't lost the people that you're aiming for, but let's just make

[25:18] this easier.

[25:19] So, we could have this whole process within the browser so that you don't have to create,

[25:23] you don't have to go over and download the full desktop wallet.

[25:32] You could just create it right from the browser through the wallet that we've built, or even

[25:41] without the wallet by presenting a QR code and saying, pay the one dash.

[25:46] And then we could even take it further and say that you can compose your proposal right

[25:55] within the browser and store that proposal data on dash platform, for example.

[26:02] And so, a lot to do there.

[26:05] And I think that that would be the reason that I want to target this is because not

[26:11] only do I want to find developers, but I want to find developers who are entrepreneurs and

[26:19] I want more proposals hitting the network, creating competition within our ecosystem.

[26:25] That helps sharpen my own saw, like that helps me stay competitive.

[26:34] And it would also increase competition for all of the different funded organizations

[26:40] as well.

[26:41] So, I think this is a win, win, win.

[26:44] But we do need at least one person, if not two, you and I, Anthony, is what we're targeting

[26:52] to go out there and do that searching for people, do that recruiting, welcome them into

[26:58] the community, show them the ropes, that kind of thing.

[27:02] I don't think that they're just going to come and we've been doing this for we've had this

[27:06] proposal system for seven, eight years, maybe.

[27:10] And just nobody really knows about it, as far as I can tell.

[27:14] And if the people that do know about it, they think that the process is too hard.

[27:19] Or I don't know, but I want to make it easy for people.

[27:23] Has Dash ever considered bounties instead of proposals like specific do this for this

[27:29] amount kind of thing?

[27:30] Yeah, I mean, that's part of it.

[27:31] I mean, you can make your proposal to be a bounty, like you can say, I want to do this

[27:37] clearly scoped piece of work, and I want 40 Dash for it.

[27:42] Right.

[27:43] But I think one of the benefits of a bounty is that it's just a list of things that are

[27:48] already there that someone can look at, like, oh, I could build that versus like, you need

[27:53] to come to us with an idea.

[27:54] Right.

[27:55] Right.

[27:56] Right.

[27:57] Yeah, I've been thinking about this, like an RFQ process, for example, where the M&Os

[28:04] can send out requests for proposals.

[28:08] That's basically what you're saying.

[28:10] Bounty is another term for it, but somebody has to make those bounties, right?

[28:14] Somebody has to, in the end, somebody has to either submit a proposal to the network

[28:20] or to the incubator.

[28:23] And that's like we've tried to serve that function, but again, quality quantity kind

[28:28] of thing.

[28:29] It's a little bit difficult to manage and to know what people want to build, because

[28:34] at the end of the day, it's the masternode owners that vote on this stuff.

[28:39] And so they're the ones that really should be doing these, but you don't see a lot of

[28:45] that.

[28:46] And I think it's because, you know, they want other people to present what they think is

[28:51] a value proposition.

[28:52] Right.

[28:53] So nobody wants to work, obviously, but it takes work with the right idea.

[28:58] So that's-

[28:59] We got a comment here, "Request for proposal sounds great, especially for the less technically

[29:04] minded M&Os.

[29:05] It would be interesting to know how many self host versus hosted."

[29:10] Yeah.

[29:11] I'm going to come back to just you and I for a minute here.

[29:17] Yeah, John Kendall, yeah, John Kendall, he's been in the Dash ecosystem for a while and

[29:24] worked through several different organizations.

[29:27] So yeah, there could easily be an RFQ or a RFP platform template where it helps people

[29:45] come up just so that I don't have to have the template.

[29:48] Just come up with a simple template.

[29:52] I have a lot of experience with writing proposals in Dash and before Dash, I was doing a lot

[29:59] of proposals as a freelance mechanical engineer.

[30:03] And so I basically know what you need, like the minimum you need is a scope, a schedule

[30:08] and a budget.

[30:09] What's the scope of work?

[30:11] What's the schedule timeframe that you're going to complete that by?

[30:15] And what is the budget that you need?

[30:18] And so that could be a simple template that we could make.

[30:23] And yeah, maybe that would be a great DAP, a great Dash platform application.

[30:33] Somebody has to build that, right?

[30:35] Anyway, I think that, let's see, I want to just keep it on this view for a minute, because

[30:42] I'm just going to scan through this to see if I've covered, okay, actually, let's go

[30:47] back to my screen share if you would, and let me know when you've got that, for a few

[30:52] more of these things.

[30:53] So this was the libraries that we've talked about, dash join.js, dash proposal.js.

[31:00] Obviously those libraries are no real good until you actually implement them into a user

[31:05] interface.

[31:06] And so that's what Jojobite would be doing, putting these things into the wallet UI, along

[31:12] with some of the other third-party integrations that we've been planning on for a while.

[31:21] Putting a nice user interface on that.

[31:23] And so this is the work that has been done in the past.

[31:26] So I think that we've now covered this.

[31:29] The one thing that I did want to say with this, again, is to re-emphasize that every

[31:37] dash that comes from and goes through the Superblock treasury system, typically, at

[31:44] least I encourage, that it goes through and is spent through one of our third-party integrations.

[31:51] And I want to make that process easier.

[31:53] So buying gift cards or bit refill, or if you need to swap it into a stable coin, use

[32:00] the Maya protocol.

[32:01] Sprits, I don't know if they have an integration, like an API that we can hit and use in our

[32:08] own as our own application, but that would be another one.

[32:12] That's where most of my funds filter through and supports that ecosystem.

[32:17] So I can't emphasize that enough.

[32:19] The importance of having a primary market where dash is created and then given to contributors

[32:27] and people that then use those through our partners.

[32:30] This is the only way that we have a sustainable ecosystem and economy is if we have that circular

[32:38] flow of funds.

[32:40] So okay, I think that covers the proposals and the idea of why we're doing this.

[32:54] The splitting of the proposals was essentially trying to get more targeted feedback between

[33:03] voters and contributors, and the votes is the best way to do that.

[33:08] So this is why we have these proposals split now.

[33:13] And just as an FYI, I know that so 800 dash per month, we have two more months of that.

[33:23] This would definitely come down in the next quarter, but 800 dash per month between you

[33:30] and me, Anthony, and trying to attract 10 to 20 new developers, I think we can use those

[33:39] funds as well, but this would probably come down next quarter if Jojobites proposal passes

[33:48] for sure.

[33:49] If Jojobites proposal doesn't pass or at least doesn't pass in the next month, maybe it passes

[33:55] the second month, but not the first month, I feel strongly enough about these projects

[34:02] that they have proposed that I will continue to fund some of this stuff out of the 800

[34:09] dash that I get this month if that passes.

[34:13] So I don't want people thinking that I've completely cut Jojobites and Kool-Aid 86 off

[34:21] from my funding.

[34:22] I have not done that.

[34:23] There's a question here, someone's asking, can the proposal be for a web app that uses

[34:30] dash or is it required to be more involved in that?

[34:33] Bring that back up again.

[34:37] So can the proposal be for, proposal can be for anything.

[34:40] A proposal can be for making a meetup at your local, you know, your local meetup group and

[34:50] presenting ideas.

[34:51] It can be marketing.

[34:52] It can be, it can be for anything.

[34:55] Web apps is, I think, yeah, definitely, I mean, web apps are the glue that ties together

[35:04] users and our infrastructure.

[35:07] So web apps are-

[35:09] Yeah.

[35:10] What do you have in mind if you have, you know, an idea for a web app, feel free to

[35:14] drop it in the chat and we'll let you know what we think of it.

[35:19] Yep.

[35:20] Yeah.

[35:21] Okay.

[35:22] So, so I think, I think we'll, we'll go ahead and wrap it up there.

[35:24] I don't have much more to say about this unless anybody has any other questions and I, I think

[35:30] we've, we've addressed some of those as well.

[35:32] So anything, any final parting words, Anthony?

[35:38] Just a last comment to read here.

[35:40] I'm glad to see this coin is making progress.

[35:42] I'm new to Dash and it does what lightning is supposed to do and really unlike Bitcoin,

[35:46] good for spending.

[35:47] Yeah.

[35:48] Speaking your language.

[35:49] Yeah, exactly.

[35:50] Yeah.

[35:51] We need more of you.

[35:52] We need more of you guys.

[35:55] Just discovered Dash, I mean, new to Dash, that's just, it's kind of sad in a way.

[36:02] I mean, it's, it's great obviously, but it's, it's sad that people have still not heard

[36:07] of Dash and haven't tried it out after all these years, but that's just the reality of

[36:13] the situation.

[36:14] There's-

[36:15] Most people have never, most people have never talked crypto at all, so.

[36:20] Yeah.

[36:21] All right guys, tune in next week.

[36:27] I think we've got, we've got about a week left of voting for these proposals.

[36:31] So I'm optimistic.

[36:33] I'm hoping that the community values this work and we will see next week.

[36:41] Haven't got a topic in line yet, but we'll, we'll come up with, with that in the next

[36:45] few days here.

[36:46] So, all right.

[36:47] See everybody.

[36:48] All right.
