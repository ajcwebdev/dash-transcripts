## Transcript

[00:00] [MUSIC PLAYING] On the heels of the Great Recession,
[00:05] yet another bankster-led economic downturn, this one triggered by the housing bubble
[00:08] and speculative derivatives markets, Bitcoin emerged. Thank God that a permissionless form of digital money
[00:15] was invented, because it happened just in time. Fast forward a handful of years.
[00:19] Bitcoin was still the most well-known crypto, but many new networks offering different functionality
[00:23] and features had spun off. The cryptosphere at this time was framed by many
[00:27] as Bitcoin and altcoins. But sometime along the way, things got more adversarial.
[00:32] So do you see a scenario where crypto replaces banks? Well, first of all, we get into the habit of saying Bitcoin
[00:40] and not crypto. Because when you say crypto, it kind of
[00:44] is a generic term for 20,000 what we call shitcoins, you know, Bitcoin wannabes.
[00:50] There's only one Bitcoin, so we just say Bitcoin. Some say this group is shrinking, but others disagree.
[00:57] Just what is a Bitcoin maximalist or maxi? A nice way to frame it is someone
[01:01] who believes that Bitcoin is the only answer. But a more realistic way to frame
[01:05] it is someone who touts their closed-mindedness as a virtue, who has replaced their reason and morality
[01:11] by an imposter. Why would someone choose to be a Bitcoin maxi?
[01:14] It appears that there are three most probable routes-- trauma, greed, and conformity.
[01:20] The trauma route. If you have been, you know, like me back in 2017, 2018,
[01:24] you got wrecked in crypto, take the time to learn about Bitcoin and learn about why Bitcoin is not crypto
[01:30] and Bitcoin is going to change the world. This person has been around the cryptosphere for a little while
[01:34] and lost money while trying to make an easy buck. They chased the latest ICOs.
[01:38] They swallowed the hype. When most of those projects collapsed,
[01:42] they were hurt, financially and egotistically. They have not yet acknowledged this trauma nor addressed it,
[01:48] what Carl Gustav Jung would call shadow work. Thus, they act from a place of regression
[01:53] rather than internal harmony. The greed route.
[01:56] This person may have previously touted the seditious or empowering aspects of Bitcoin,
[02:00] but has today replaced such idealism with a desire for material gain.
[02:04] They may be relatively unaware of this pivot as they have merely aligned themselves
[02:08] with the marketing around Bitcoin. Everyone always says that BlackRock's evil,
[02:12] all these companies are evil, et cetera, et cetera. But they are profit-making, incentive-driven machines.
[02:18] So wherever the incentive is, they'll go towards that. And the beautiful thing about Bitcoin
[02:22] is no matter what your incentive is when you came to Bitcoin, Bitcoin fixes you.
[02:26] The influx of capital from the very institutions that had previously been decried as welcomed.
[02:31] Bitcoin has won over some of America's best known billionaires
[02:34] and institutions worldwide are treating it as a serious financial asset.
[02:38] After all, it'll further deepen their stacks. Sell all your crap coins, put that money in Bitcoin
[02:43] and just sit back and relax and get rich. The conformity route.
[02:47] I have a lot of hope for cryptocurrencies, I really do. I don't know too much about them,
[02:52] but Bitcoin seems to be the one. This person is too intellectually lazy
[02:56] to do their own research. They're late to the game
[02:58] and probably haven't used Bitcoin before to buy anything. They merely huddle.
[03:02] They see Bitcoin as too big to fail and find solace in being part of a tribe.
[03:06] Harsh, yes, but untrue? Consider a newish phrase tossed around, being orange-pilled.
[03:12] Going into Christmas, you got any advice for folks in terms of how they can help orange-pill their family?
[03:18] Essentially spreading and swallowing the gospel that Bitcoin is the only valid solution.
[03:23] But if Bitcoin really were the one true crypto, the best alternative to central bank money
[03:27] with all the necessary attributes, then isn't a red pill sufficient?
[03:31] A red pill, after all, demonstrates the willingness to be open to potentially life-changing truth.
[03:36] If someone breaks free from the matrix and is on the hunt for the best alternative
[03:40] to central bank money, shouldn't they, according to Bitcoin maxis, land on Bitcoin?
[03:44] Why do they need an orange pill? They need an orange pill
[03:47] because Bitcoin is not currently the best positioned to be the alternative.
[03:51] Hence, Bitcoin maxis need their own sacrament. It's more an outward manifestation
[03:56] that one has bought into the dogma. - So ask not what Bitcoin could do for you.
[04:01] Ask what you can do for Bitcoin. - But why even spend time on this topic?
[04:07] Bitcoin is still the most well-known crypto. It's what most of us first heard of.
[04:11] And if someone today decides to check out what crypto is all about,
[04:14] Bitcoin is still likely to be their first stop. If they encounter a closed, toxic culture, that's not good.
[04:19] So if an opportunity presents itself to have an exchange with a Bitcoin maxi, engage.
[04:24] While it may be hard to sway someone who is a true believer. - In this new world order that we're going into,
[04:30] the question is left, if not Bitcoin, then what? - Those on the periphery and those new to crypto
[04:36] may be more open-minded. A person cannot serve two conflicting ideas.
[04:40] They cannot work to serve humanity through the creation of an empowering technology
[04:45] and to serve their own love for money. The Bitcoin maxis have positioned themselves
[04:48] in the latter camp. Hopefully they will soon see the light for their own good
[04:52] and for the good of others. And let us, individually, always remain open-minded
[04:56] and always asking questions. Are we building the best alternative?
[05:00] What are other networks doing? What can we learn?
[05:03] What ideas are we advancing? What ideas are we serving?
[05:07] (upbeat music) - Wonderful intro, as always, Pete.
[05:21] And if everybody hasn't already noticed, we are doing things a little bit different today.
[05:26] I am your host, Rion. And with me today is Pete and Hilawe.
[05:34] How's it going, gentlemen? - Doing well.
[05:38] - Thank you. - It's great. Good to see you.
[05:40] - So Amanda, who you usually see as my co-host, is switching roles today.
[05:46] And she is behind the scenes today, as Pete is on this side of the camera.
[05:51] So, good to have you, Pete, on this side. I know you just recently were on a podcast
[05:59] with the Desert Lynx, Joel. But I think this is the first time
[06:03] that you've been featured here on the Dash Incubator. Is that right?
[06:09] - Yes, that's correct, Rion. - All right, well, it's good to have you.
[06:12] So the reason that you two gentlemen are on today is I was looking at the,
[06:21] and actually, I'll just go ahead and get my screen share ready here
[06:25] while I give this little intro. We're talking about a proposal
[06:30] that is about to be, I think there are two days left in the cycle
[06:39] for the Treasury proposal. I will find out in just a minute here.
[06:44] So, yeah. So we're talking about this proposal today,
[06:51] the DashDAO Irrevocable Trust Next Steps proposal, submitted by Brian Foster.
[06:57] And I may want to just read all of this, or at least most of this.
[07:07] It is a pretty short proposal. It's just a governance proposal,
[07:10] so it's not asking for funding other than a reimbursement of the one Dash.
[07:14] Here's where the vote stands right now. And let's see.
[07:21] Does this show me how many days left are in the proposal to vote?
[07:26] If not, I will go ahead and bring up MNO Watch to see. Because we are getting pretty close to the end here.
[07:40] There are 47 hours left. So this is the time to kind of get your last votes in
[07:48] for this, but also the other proposals that are on the docket right now.
[07:54] And as I noticed, as I looked through the proposal, like we've done this before,
[08:01] where we have a proposal that's not directly related to the incubator,
[08:06] but maybe somewhat tangentially related to the incubator. But regardless of its connection with the incubator,
[08:14] it affects Dash in potentially a significant way. So as I was looking through the comments,
[08:21] I noticed that you both had, I think the highest voted comments on the proposal.
[08:31] So I wanted to get you on the show to kind of get your thoughts on this proposal.
[08:35] So before I go any further into the actual proposal, maybe Pete and Hilawe, I'll start with you, Pete.
[08:44] What's your interest in at least saying yes to my invitation to come on the show?
[08:51] - Yeah, I mean, I think this is an important topic. I mean, DCG Inc has obviously been
[09:03] the largest Dash funded organization and the most well-funded in terms of Dash
[09:09] over the years. And I realized some time ago
[09:15] when I was out talking to people about crypto and then suggesting Dash in particular
[09:21] and why it stands out to me, it's a little bit,
[09:24] I mean, I still think Dash has the best functionality around in terms of a payment-oriented crypto,
[09:30] but I was involved in another conversation. It was actually in a group that I'm in,
[09:36] in a metal music. And someone said, oh, check out this site for this band.
[09:41] And someone said, oh, that's still around. I thought that was like dead or whatever.
[09:44] And I'd seen that comment around like in the crypto sphere about Dash,
[09:48] like, oh, Dash is still around. And I wondered, you know, why is that?
[09:52] And I think a large part of it is just that a big component that has been talked about
[09:58] since 2015 evolution has, you know, had delay after delay after delay.
[10:04] And I just wonder, well, why is that? And I'm very much someone who wants to strike the root
[10:11] and figure out the incentives around whatever structure exists.
[10:16] And it seems like the structure that was created around Dash Core Group,
[10:23] making a Dash Core Group incorporated along with a trust and trust protectors
[10:27] just created a lot of perverse incentives. And so I think we now have an opportunity
[10:32] to make a change, make a clean cut and move in a better direction for the network.
[10:39] And so I'll just stop there with that. - Good introduction to your thoughts there.
[10:47] Hilawe, what would you say? What prompted you to say yes to my invitation
[10:53] to come on the show to discuss this proposal? - I think you've both known
[10:57] I've had strong opinions in the past about, I served as a Dash Trust Protector DTP
[11:05] from 2020 through 2021. I had a lot of experience in there
[11:12] about how the trust worked, how the trust protectors interacted with the DCG board,
[11:17] which were the DCG officers and how MNOs perceived what oversight meant,
[11:25] what accountability, transparency, all these things that a lot of us came in
[11:32] with how we were voted in as well, kind of calling for that.
[11:37] And yeah, and I don't wanna get too far ahead, but I just noticed that my idea of how a DAO would go
[11:45] and my experience as a trust protector just didn't, it's antithetical to itself.
[11:55] I saw the interweaving between a legal structure, keeping that going and the ethos of cryptocurrencies.
[12:03] And it just didn't go together. And I just noticed that it was some kind of a status
[12:13] that was created that other Dash funded organizations or DFOs really didn't have.
[12:21] So, and this is not saying anything about people in there. It was just the system that I was noticing.
[12:28] And that's when I became more vocal. And so I've been keeping up with the trust,
[12:34] even though I haven't been a trust protector since then, I've been keeping up with how things have been going.
[12:40] So that's why I'm interested. - And were you one of the first,
[12:46] were you in the first cohort of trust protectors or a subsequent one?
[12:50] - I was probably on the third year of it. - Third year.
[12:54] Wow, it's crazy to think that we've been doing this for over, well, at least three years,
[12:59] but I think it's been more like five or something with this structure, right?
[13:05] - 2,000 years. - Okay, so let's go into the proposal itself again.
[13:10] And I'm gonna read at least the first few bits of it. Let's see.
[13:18] Okay, so what is this proposal specifically for? This proposal is being raised
[13:23] to highlight some of the challenges we faced with the trust that was created back in 2017
[13:28] and determine how we should move forward. Dash Core Group Incorporated is a C corporation
[13:34] incorporated in the state of Delaware and has headquarters in Arizona.
[13:38] As with all corporations, DCG needs to issue shares, certificates of ownership
[13:42] to one or more people or organizations. Given the DCG was created to support a decentralized network
[13:49] and does not operate to generate profit, and even if it did have profit,
[13:54] there's no personal organization that deserves the profit for owning the company.
[14:00] To solve the above dilemma, a New Zealand trust was created to own the shares of DCG
[14:05] and was to be managed by a board of Dash trust protectors who were to be elected by the Dash Masternode Network.
[14:12] Purpose of the trust of the DTP is to manage the dealings of the trust
[14:17] and oversee the DCG board of directors. This trust deed states that if DCG
[14:24] were to ever get dissolved, all remaining assets would get donated to the Red Cross.
[14:28] Okay, so, and then I'll stop reading there, but he then goes, he, meaning Brian Foster of DCG,
[14:37] who's writing this proposal, goes on to talk about three of the problems
[14:41] that this is addressing. And you can read those problems,
[14:48] but as I was, as I had read this, the one that stuck out the most to me
[14:53] was just this problem three. And it just, to me, it seems like
[14:56] this is the biggest motivation. Without a valid trust,
[15:00] DCG will not be able to verify our corporate structure to any further partner, future partner,
[15:07] and our standing as a legitimate organization is greatly jeopardized.
[15:13] So to me, it sounds like maybe you could jump in here, Hilawe, being a past trust protector.
[15:21] What was the original purpose of the trust? And is this problem three correct?
[15:29] Meaning that we, it seems to imply that we can't really partner with other organizations
[15:36] without this trust. Was that the original purpose
[15:40] or what was the original purpose? - I think you're muted, Hilawe.
[15:51] - Hilawe, you're muted. - I did that, okay.
[15:55] So initially there was a DCG Inc. C-Corp created by Brian Taylor.
[16:00] And then he figured out, from what I could tell, he figured out he had a thousand shares of DCG in his name
[16:07] and as a shareholder. And in his words, that's a legal liability
[16:13] that he did not want to take on. And also in his word, it should be something that,
[16:19] he should find a way that the network has some interest in it.
[16:24] And so with his research and everything, he found this New Zealand trust system
[16:31] where it allows a group of people that may not be identified to be beneficiaries,
[16:36] but they, in our case, there's also a way for them to make their voices heard.
[16:40] So that's how this, it's a unique, it sounds pretty neat, but he created a system that would allow that,
[16:49] that would take the liability off of him. And so the part about verifying,
[16:55] so problem three kind of talks about corporate verification and with banks, they do wanna know that this is a company.
[17:05] So if you're gonna hold bank accounts, you wanna pay people in fiat,
[17:09] which was something that Ryan Taylor, that's another reason that he did it.
[17:13] Then he needed to find a way to involve the network in his mind and also have the fiat,
[17:25] what he called fiat benefits. And then apparently, I mean,
[17:33] I've heard sometimes some of the integrators or Coinbase may wanna know that this is a legitimate project
[17:41] or legitimate group within a project. I'm not really sure, I've never really verified that,
[17:48] but there could be times where some partners do wanna know that it's still operating in some way,
[17:56] that there's a central entity. Now, I can't verify that myself.
[18:02] - Okay. Pete, go ahead.
[18:06] - Yeah, if I could jump in, 'cause this does seem to be the major crux
[18:09] that's remaining for the reason why the trust needs to exist.
[18:14] And I'll just back up. I had originally thought the trust existed.
[18:20] - If you could just recap, what was the main reason that the trust existed?
[18:23] - The main rationale trust needs to perpetuate is to hold the shares of DCG Inc.
[18:30] So that DCG Inc. can remain incorporated and therefore interact with business partners and the like.
[18:37] And I'll just back up because a previous understanding I had
[18:41] was that the trust maybe provided some legal protection for the DCG team.
[18:46] And I'll just say, no one's putting that forward now. And I've learned that that's not the case
[18:52] from Patrick Quinn, former trust protector and interim DCG Inc. CEO
[18:59] and Brian Foster acknowledge that as well. So that's off the table for anyone
[19:04] who was still of that perspective. So back to this point that we're talking about
[19:08] of the necessity of being incorporated to interact with business partners.
[19:14] I don't think that's the case because I asked elsewhere,
[19:19] I said, well, what do other decentralized crypto projects do? Does everyone have some form of incorporation?
[19:25] And so, if we walk back this line of reasoning that the trust holds the assets,
[19:32] which Brian Foster and others at DCG Inc. say, today is only the shares of the corporation.
[19:37] There's no other assets that are being discussed. So it's just the shares of the corporation.
[19:41] Then we asked, why do we even need the corporation? And so again, the argument put forth
[19:47] is that this corporation status needs to exist to interact with business partners.
[19:53] But, so then the question is, well, how do business integrations occur
[19:58] without that structure? And so I asked folks at Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin,
[20:04] eCash, Fero, Litecoin, Monero, Nano, Zcash, other payment oriented cryptos.
[20:11] And they all came back and said, we don't have a centralized structure.
[20:16] Anyone's welcome to add us to like a sex or this or that using our documentation.
[20:22] There's folks available for support or help if need be, but there's no central entity necessary.
[20:29] And that was repeated time and again by all these networks. And again, to speak to what Halawi said earlier
[20:36] about the ethos of crypto. I mean, it just seems antithetical
[20:42] to need a centralized entity that's asking permission from these nation state regimes
[20:48] and paying them annual tribute to be able to operate. I think it just creates a target,
[20:55] were that ever to happen, and we could be much better served without that
[21:00] for a number of reasons. - Okay.
[21:04] All right. So if we jump back to the proposal again,
[21:08] there are these three problems. Just to summarize,
[21:15] the first problem is basically saying, it's difficult to find people
[21:20] to fill the role of a trust protector. The second problem is essentially saying,
[21:26] we've had problems with our existing trustees. We had a trustee in Switzerland,
[21:33] we had a trustee in New Zealand, and they're not working out for us.
[21:37] That's basically what that says. And then problem three is,
[21:41] we kind of need a trust so that DCG can have a corporate structure
[21:47] that people are comfortable with, and that we can then use.
[21:52] The trust was used as a way to give our partners proof that we're a corporation and things like that.
[21:59] And that was, so we kind of still need to trust. Now, moving on to the options of moving forward,
[22:06] there's an option one, two, and three, and to just cut to the chase.
[22:10] Let's see, I thought that, I thought that maybe I was looking
[22:20] at a different version of this proposal, but I thought that there was somewhere
[22:23] that said DCG's recommendation. Is that on now or-
[22:29] - It's at the very bottom. - Okay, while other options have been discussed
[22:34] amongst the community, the DCG board had previously seated.
[22:38] No, they weren't. - I believe DCG Inc. is in favor of option one,
[22:44] which is a new trust without trust protectors. - That's what I remember reading,
[22:49] but I don't see it here. - Yeah, because option three isn't even an option
[22:53] because both Brian Foster and Quantum Explorer have weighed in and said,
[22:57] no one's comfortable doing that. So that's just, I don't know,
[23:00] put up there as a semblance of an alternative. So the only options they're putting forth,
[23:06] in my opinion, are option one, which is a trust with no trust protectors,
[23:10] or option two, a trust with trust protectors. Yeah.
[23:14] - Okay, interesting. I just zoomed back out to see if there was something weird
[23:18] with the CSS on this side or something like that, which there is.
[23:21] So here is the DCG recommendation. Recommends option one, like you just said.
[23:27] And it's to, I won't read option one on the screen, but there you have it.
[23:33] Did somebody wanna summarize that or did you? - Yeah, Pete Connors did.
[23:39] It's just create a new trust with a single trustee. Right now they have a co-trustee,
[23:44] one in Switzerland, well, they did, and one in New Zealand,
[23:47] and no DTPs, no trust protectors, but it would have the option to include trust protectors
[23:55] at a later date if the network wanted it kind of thing. - Okay.
[24:00] - Option two is create a new trust again. And there's a reason that all these have to be new,
[24:05] but we can discuss that. Create a new trust with DTP oversight,
[24:09] just like the original. They claim it'll cost double.
[24:14] I didn't really look into why. And then option three is basically create,
[24:21] go make it a standalone DCG Inc. So take away the overall structure above it
[24:29] and just be a Delaware C Corp and that's it. And then the DCG board members
[24:34] would become the 100% shareholders between themselves. And then option four is what Pete had proposed
[24:45] inside the comments, which I'll let, let's let him speak.
[24:48] - Yeah, and before we get to that, I just wanted to make it clear to everybody
[24:53] what voting means in this context. Brian does spell out what voting yes means.
[25:01] He says voting yes for this proposal would be showing favor for option one.
[25:06] And if this proposal passes, DCG would take steps to fully dissolve
[25:10] the illegitimate trust, retire the current or past trustees
[25:15] and reject payment of the last of the latest invoice from the Switzerland contract, contact.
[25:22] Now, my understanding of an invoice from being a personal business owner myself
[25:28] is you give somebody an invoice when work has already been done
[25:31] and that's owed to the contractor. I never have invoiced anybody
[25:37] when I haven't actually done the work. So I wonder if he means like a purchase order
[25:44] because in earlier in the proposal, it says that we were able to regain contact
[25:52] with one of the trustees, which we had lost for some time.
[25:57] We regained that when he sent his invoice. - So can I clarify, that's problem two, right?
[26:03] - Yes. - I believe. Yeah, so it appears, first of all,
[26:09] we didn't realize that there was a co-trustee even as Dash Trust Protectors until recently.
[26:13] - And that's explained in problem one. - In problem two.
[26:19] So there was a co-trustee in Switzerland that basically left his employment.
[26:24] We don't know how he left, it really doesn't matter. The point is he left.
[26:27] He's not employed there anymore. And instead of letting DCG know that he left
[26:34] and they better sign up with another trustee, apparently he forged his signature
[26:42] and then went to the other co-trustee, which is New Zealand, approached them and said,
[26:48] "Hey, you gotta sign your co-trustee side to continue." And they saw this and they resigned themselves.
[26:58] They removed themselves as a co-trustee when they saw that legal liability.
[27:02] And so now basically DCG is entity-less. Not at DCG Inc level, but above them,
[27:10] the trust structure is basically defunct right now without a trustee.
[27:15] And this is why the proposal came out. - Okay, but do we owe anybody money right now
[27:21] in at least their minds? - That's for them to answer,
[27:25] but it has been in the past where there've been months where we owed them and then we pay them later.
[27:31] So it probably is an invoice. So I'm not saying in this case, that's what happened,
[27:35] but I know in the past, there's been like six months that passed
[27:39] and then they would send us an invoice. So that could easily be the case.
[27:45] - Well, the language said an invoice for the following year's work or something like that.
[27:50] It didn't make sense to me, but that's a detail we don't need to worry about.
[27:54] So let's move into, do either or both of you want to just come out explicitly
[28:01] and say whether you're for this proposal now knowing what yes means against the proposal?
[28:07] It does say, I didn't quite finish reading it, but the other thing that it would do
[28:12] is reject payment of the latest invoice from the Switzerland contract contact.
[28:17] And then research will start on finding a new trustee to set up a simple trust
[28:21] with no dash trust protector oversight and reissuing shares to the new trust.
[28:29] So that's what they're saying that they recommend. That's what voting yes would mean.
[28:34] What happens if the yes votes do not win? If this proposal does not pass by our criteria,
[28:44] what does that mean? And again, do you want to just come out
[28:49] and explicitly say like, I'm for this proposal, I'm against this proposal,
[28:54] or I think that there should be something else considered here?
[28:58] First, you, Pete. - Yeah, I think Brian did answer your question
[29:03] about what happens if it doesn't, if they don't get enough yeses to pass.
[29:06] And that was, he left a comment in response to a question Amanda had about what voting meant.
[29:12] And I think, I believe Brian just said that, you know, if the proposal doesn't pass,
[29:17] they'll evaluate what comments came in and maybe put forth a subsequent proposal.
[29:22] But yeah, I'm very much not in favor of option one, two or three.
[29:27] And as Halawi mentioned, I put forth an option four in the comments,
[29:30] which is for DCG Inc to become DCG for a lot of reasons to increase nimbleness, accountability, communication,
[29:39] morale, alignment with the ethos of cryptocurrency, et cetera. And if I could, real quick,
[29:47] I made like a two minute video just to try to underscore that point.
[29:50] I'll just share that real quick. - Yeah, please do.
[29:52] - Okay, thanks. - And so now what we're trying to do
[29:53] is fix ease of use and adoption. And this brings us to Dash Evolution.
[29:59] - The piece de resistance of Dash is a forthcoming product called Evolution.
[30:05] - Using the Wayback Machine, here's Dash.org in 2017. Note there was a tab in the menu specifically for Evolution.
[30:12] On that page it says, "Our next step will be to release an alpha version
[30:15] "of Evolution toward the end of 2017." - Speaking in terms of milestones,
[30:19] this year what we want to do is by the end of this year is release some form of the Evolution platform
[30:25] that developers are actually able to work with. - So let me know if you have any thoughts
[30:30] one way or the other of Dash Evolution. Granted, they've obviously been talking about this
[30:35] for over two years, well, it's three years now. - Again, using the Wayback Machine,
[30:40] we visit the Dash.org site, this time for 2019. According to the roadmap,
[30:45] Evolution functionality was slated for release that year. - Is Evolution ever coming?
[30:50] - How confident is DCG.A platform MVP release will happen this year?
[30:55] - Yeah, I'll take that. I'm very confident.
[31:00] - We need to make sure that in parallel to all that, we start to deliver on time.
[31:05] We've got to make sure we improve our credibility as a professional software team to deliver software
[31:11] when we say we're going to. - When will we have a functional platform?
[31:17] - Ah, good question. So you know the first five planets?
[31:26] You know, like what, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter?
[31:31] We have to have them all aligned. No, I'm joking.
[31:35] - Now when we look at the current roadmap at Dash.org, the V1 rollout is included, but no date is given.
[31:41] - Evolution is five years late, which is at this point, and they haven't been defunded.
[31:47] It's kind of like, well... - It's a hell of nuts if you think about it.
[31:51] - What was the point in having a doubt? - Yeah, so I put that together
[31:58] and there was a lot of other clips I could have used. I could have made a parallel video
[32:01] that wasn't about Evolution, but was about we're going to do better with communication.
[32:05] We're going to do better with communication. And that's something that a lot of former DCG employees
[32:09] have said, or people who tried to interact with DCG, you know, especially previously,
[32:16] of the difficulty in communication. But for me, it just comes down to accountability.
[32:20] And if this product has been promised for so long and there's been no accountability,
[32:27] I believe a large part of that is due to the structure, the insulating nature that DCG Inc. has been afforded
[32:34] by the trust and the trust protectors. When the trust protectors were created,
[32:38] Ryan Taylor blogged about it. And he said, you know,
[32:41] this provides a valuable new option of oversight of DCG beyond what can be done by the,
[32:47] provided by the proposal system alone. So like, why is that necessary?
[32:50] Like, and, you know, and other writers put forth that the trust protectors would allow surgical precision
[32:57] to adjust to remove whomever or whatever is. But obviously that's not the case
[33:01] because the trust protectors had to interface with Dash Core Group's board,
[33:07] which was made of Dash Core Group Inc. employees. So the incentives are just not there.
[33:11] And so DCG, I mean, as Sam Westridge, Quantum Explorer, CTO of Dash,
[33:17] currently has put forth numerous times, it's not fair to hold him and current employees accountable
[33:22] for past employees' failure to deliver it. At one point he made an analogy that said,
[33:28] well, if you hired a plumber who made a mistake on your house a couple of years ago,
[33:33] are you not gonna hire a new plumber and believe that they, you know,
[33:36] they could do something different? And I grant him that it's not appropriate to hold,
[33:40] to say he or his current colleagues should be vilified or anything.
[33:44] But if we don't, if we stop there, then no one improves and nothing improves
[33:49] and we just get the same. But so we need to ask, why has this been a pattern?
[33:54] And why has this existed? Why has no accountability happened?
[33:59] Why has DCG Inc been allowed to continue to skirt along? At one, I found an interview with Ryan Taylor
[34:05] and he said at one point there was, you know, 23 full-time, 23 people working on Evolution,
[34:10] not including project management. So they've had massive resources allocated to this endeavor.
[34:16] And, you know, those of us involved with Dash for a long time, we've been talking about it,
[34:20] talking about it, and it just has failed to materialize. And I know maybe we're getting closer now,
[34:26] but Evolution's not even used as the name anymore. So anyway, there's been mission creep,
[34:30] there's been unaccountability. And I truly believe that the legal protections
[34:36] that DCG Inc enjoys because of, you know, saying the trust protectors are an accountability mechanism
[34:43] when clearly they weren't and they became so frustrated and as a way responsive to the discord
[34:50] within the Dash network that a couple of years ago, the proposal was put forth to make DCG Inc more granular.
[34:57] And that resulted in a lot of good conversation. But again, here we are today and DCG Inc
[35:03] wants to continue course as they've operated for years and it does no one any good.
[35:09] I think now's the time to move from DCG Inc to DCG. And, you know, the biggest critique of that
[35:16] is we might lose some top devs or how are we going to attract top devs?
[35:20] And I mean, I just ask that person asking the question to read Frederick Bastiat's "The Seen and the Unseen."
[35:27] I mean, yes, we may lose some current folks that are unwilling to be paid in Dash,
[35:31] but we probably, in the long run, yes, there may be some, you know,
[35:37] uncomfortableness in the short term, but in the long run, we'll be better off for it
[35:40] because we'll attract people that are aligned with our mission and not happy to say
[35:46] they're working on a product, but not willing to use it themselves
[35:49] and not willing to recognize and learn the pinch points that we all, that do try to use Dash every day
[35:55] for our lives experience. - Yeah, great, great points and great little video
[36:02] as difficult as that is to watch. I think the overall assumption is that the trust mechanism
[36:11] has something to do with this underperformance. And I'm not sure if everyone would agree with that.
[36:18] I myself would have questions with that, but your point about
[36:24] alternatives potentially being better than the downsides if we got rid of it, that is a very good point.
[36:31] I know in the incubator, to bring this a little bit back to home,
[36:34] we've just decided, Andy initially, and I was fully on board with this decision,
[36:42] we're not going to touch fiat. We're going to use our product 100%
[36:49] regardless of the pain that that creates, whether that's, we don't have the developers
[36:56] that we might get if we could pay them in fiat or whatever that means,
[37:03] we're going to work through those pain points. And I personally, I think I have,
[37:09] I think it's a good thing to do because I, for example, I'm using Sprits, I'm using all sorts of services
[37:18] that help me to do those conversions into goods and services, or even in the dollars,
[37:23] and that helps those partnerships as well. So, Flowey, what do you have to add
[37:29] to what Pete said, or the video, or thoughts? - I'll go through my thoughts on the options,
[37:36] which one I like, but just want to add, the problem one was about DTPs not wanting to serve.
[37:42] And it wasn't a matter of whether they were paid or not. We had a lot of great efforts to like,
[37:50] to push a dynamic roadmap, meaning it changes as needed. You know, you'd prefer that it stays,
[37:58] but these things change. Clear deliverable dates, that's the big one.
[38:02] And I'll try to address that. Again, it's not targeting people, personnel,
[38:08] I just don't want to go there. It's more about the system did not allow us to even,
[38:15] to do that, to actually get those results. And it's kind of demoralizing at some point.
[38:21] And then we also found out the MNOs did not actually want change.
[38:26] They wanted us to kind of wave, like point a finger, say, "Hey, do better."
[38:31] Like that was probably the extent of the role that was preferred based on decision proposals we put in.
[38:39] So, and that was clear to us. Like we were asked in so many words,
[38:47] in so many votes to not be that active. And this is like, well, what's the point?
[38:51] So that's, just want to add that part about problem one. And that's why you don't have DTPs anymore,
[38:57] along with the self-doxing that you have to do. So clarify that part.
[39:04] So as far as the options, so option one and option two are very similar.
[39:09] One with DTP and one without trust protectors. Option three is standalone.
[39:16] I also prefer option four, which is basically DCG without a corporate structure,
[39:22] but being paid directly from the network in Dash, instead of paying out employees, contractors and fiat.
[39:30] Because, I mean, definitely it is more convenient, but I think the work to do that,
[39:37] whatever you need to do with the Dash should be up to the individual.
[39:41] And that's something you brought up yourself, Rion, because you, I think we saw Pasta and Latte
[39:51] express this as well. 'Cause we were asking them
[39:54] in the trust protectors channel and Discord, what would happen if you got paid in Dash?
[39:58] And they said the complexity would go up. And I don't want to get into Latte's business,
[40:02] but his complexity would be even more. And his residency issues and all kinds of things
[40:07] and things that he needs to show wherever he lives, that he gets paid from a so-called legitimate source
[40:16] and all these things. And none of them said they can't do it.
[40:19] It would just be highly inconvenient. - Right.
[40:24] Which that kind of inconvenience is a benefit in a lot of ways.
[40:29] - Yes. - If I were being paid in fiat,
[40:32] I would not be using Spritz. And that would be not good for one of our key partnerships.
[40:37] I don't know if now is the right time, but we've had some comments come in.
[40:43] So Amanda, do you want to... So Amanda.
[40:47] - Can I just add like which option, but there's a fifth option.
[40:52] I think I need to address that. Sorry.
[40:55] - Go ahead, yeah. - Because if we don't address that
[40:58] and it goes to the end of the video, people may miss it.
[41:01] I just want to make sure that gets in. Sorry to take over.
[41:04] - Let's do it. - Yeah.
[41:05] - Okay, so the DIF, the Dash Investment Foundation. So Agnew Pickens, just, you know,
[41:12] he threw in a comment in the DIF supervisor's trust protection channel.
[41:17] He said, "What if the DIF on DCG Inc shares all of them?" And I was like, "Whoa."
[41:23] And then I think Brian Foster eventually saw that. He was like, "I'm gonna have a meeting."
[41:26] Eventually he said, "I'm gonna have a meeting with the DIF to speak on that."
[41:30] And basically what would take is the DIF supervisors voting on it,
[41:33] but first discussions, obviously. And so I went into the Dash after party,
[41:39] you know, everybody's invited to come in, just contact Joel and he'll give you the link.
[41:44] Anyway, so it voted in. Some of the comments we heard in the after party,
[41:50] a really good one, especially from one time, was will the DIF supervisors be expected
[41:56] to somewhat act as an oversight role? Is this like a pseudo trust protector role?
[42:01] Or is the DIF director, now the DIF director is paid. I think it's a lawyer.
[42:06] Will he be expected to watch over the company? I mean, it brings in a lot of,
[42:10] and then also will being a DIF supervisor now become not worth it?
[42:18] Like, is it scrutiny? The network is very much interested in how DCG is doing.
[42:24] And now basically it still creates what Pete is saying. It creates just another layer, another structure,
[42:32] another, in my words, a special status. And I would say the short answer
[42:39] is whether a DFO Dash Funding Organization is funded or defunded should be the only thing
[42:46] that matters in the DAO. I would say that's...
[42:50] So I would go with probably option four. If option three happened, yeah, not ideal,
[42:57] but at least it's not interlinked with the legal structure.
[43:01] The DAO is not interlinked with the legal structure then. At least that's a good thing.
[43:04] And option five is, I would call it less like a quick solution for DCG.
[43:12] It actually, for DCG- - That's involving the DIF, right?
[43:15] - I'm sorry? - Option five is involving the DIF?
[43:18] - Yeah, the DIF would have 100% share ownership. Now remember the DIF supervisors don't go into,
[43:24] they have partial ownerships of other companies, right? They don't go into their management meetings
[43:29] and tell them, this is how we want you to run things. That's not how it works.
[43:33] So it's creating another, some complication, more complexity for the DIF.
[43:39] - So yeah, maybe Amanda, if you could switch over to my screen share,
[43:44] just so that we can get some of these comments on the video. I noticed that the DIF did comment.
[43:51] So I'm just gonna scroll through that. So they basically made clear that there's no overlap
[43:57] between Dash Core Group and the DIF. And I'm not sure exactly what that implies,
[44:04] but there's, you know, there is that. And here's this option.
[44:10] There's a different option five. And so you've got comments from you, Halaway,
[44:17] and obviously a lot from ItsDemo. He's very talkative.
[44:25] Quantum Explorer. I think I'll, Pete,
[44:29] do you have anything to add while I'm scrolling through this? I just want people to be able to kind of stop
[44:34] and pause on some of this stuff, but. - Sure, I'll address Amanda's question
[44:39] that she's put forth, which is can, she says folks can work with the incubator
[44:43] without having to dox themselves. Can that, is that the same case for DCG Inc?
[44:47] And I believe the answer is no, because I did see in the comment thread on Discord
[44:53] about, you know, that Halaway mentioned that involves some current DCG Inc. employees,
[44:58] how open they would be to this option four and how, and it was stated, one of them said that, you know,
[45:04] currently the only people who know my true identity are DCG Inc., you know, is DCG Inc.
[45:09] So I believe then that that means they had to self-dox to, you know, get a, be employed there full-time.
[45:16] And that is something that was mentioned, but I'll just reiterate with the Dash Trusted Protectors.
[45:22] I mean, if we're supposedly creating a medium of exchange that we wanna see used by anyone, anywhere in the world,
[45:29] why do we have an entity, the Dash Trust Protectors, that excludes people that happen to be born
[45:35] within a certain political jurisdiction, something beyond their control,
[45:38] just like the amount of melanin in their skin? But that is a structure that is included in option two.
[45:45] That is a, you know, a question. If you're born in a certain area,
[45:49] you cannot be a Dash Trust Protector, or if you happen to be labeled a "felon" by the regime,
[45:55] then you can't be a Trust Protector. But I'm sure we all know people who are "felons"
[46:01] that have never harmed a person or property, but they've just disobeyed the regime and their legalese.
[46:06] So these are just more reasons, again, to emphasize, I'm just, to underscore what Hlaoui said,
[46:13] I'm not trying to attack specific people. I just think it's important that we look at the structure
[46:17] and the systems and the incentives that it makes. And so I'm just saying we should simplify.
[46:22] This was a line in Thomas Paine's "Common Sense." He said, "The more simple anything is,
[46:28] "the less liable it is to be disordered, "the more easier repaired when disordered."
[46:33] Henry David Thoreau said in Walden, "Simplify, simplify." We all know the KISS principle, "Keep it simple, stupid."
[46:41] That was popularized by the Navy in the '60s. Again, these are just all little mantras against,
[46:49] phrases against overly complex bureaucratic and organizations, and that's what we have with DCG Inc.
[46:56] And I very much hope that Masternode owners will see that the best way to move forward
[47:05] is to remove the complexity that has surrounded DCG for all these years.
[47:11] - Yeah, thank you for all those thoughts. So I missed some of the comments
[47:18] that you're popping up on the screen, Amanda, but it looks like Digital Cash Network
[47:24] is saying we've got some alternatives, alternative structures, one of those being the Utah DAO,
[47:31] which I can look into if we really need to. That was brought up by one of our
[47:38] Utah conference attendees, Tron, not any way related to the Tron Network,
[47:44] but yeah, he's been in crypto and we're good friends, Tron and I.
[47:50] So I could definitely look into that. See, Amanda adds, "Some devs leave DCG Inc.
[47:55] "because they don't want to be paid in Dash. "Might we not gain new devs
[47:59] "who wouldn't have been willing to dox themselves "to a corporation otherwise?"
[48:03] Yeah, that's a good point as well. - Exactly.
[48:04] Yeah, that's the unseen I was trying to speak to. - Yeah.
[48:08] I think it was clear that DCG board members would be especially doxed.
[48:14] So for example, Yujin does work for DCG, but not for DCG Inc., right?
[48:22] He's independent, actually doesn't yet. If he wanted to, he could get paid in Dash.
[48:27] I don't think he gets paid. So there's ways of doing this already
[48:35] where you don't have to be exposed. But I think as an employee, you don't get...
[48:42] The government will know that you work for DCG Inc., but if you work for a DCG board member,
[48:49] then you'll be public. I think that was the point that was being made.
[48:53] I think Pasta was concerned in the Discord if he became a DCG board member,
[49:02] it would be a whole lot more public. - Yeah.
[49:06] Well, we've talked a lot about the downsides to this proposal and alternatives that we'd like to see.
[49:16] I would like to just say that I'm happy to have Brian Foster come on the show as well
[49:24] on a subsequent visit, if he's interested to give his side of the story.
[49:30] That's something that we've done in the past, is if a proposal is important enough,
[49:36] we get both sides of the... I mean, there's a lot of sides.
[49:40] So this particular proposal. So I would also encourage other people
[49:46] to put in specific proposals yourselves with, I support this option or that option,
[49:55] because with the blunt tool of the DAO that we have, that's really the only way that we can move forward
[50:01] is to have proposals. So one of my main issues with this proposal is,
[50:07] yes, it's a proposal that brings up an interesting topic, but it's unclear how we're going to move forward
[50:14] because as it stands, I personally don't think that it's likely
[50:18] that it's going to pass, but what's that going to mean?
[50:20] There are at least three or four different options that we could pursue.
[50:27] And so without proposals for those options, it's hard to see what we're going to do.
[50:34] And I'd like to know from DCG, what are they going to do if the proposal doesn't pass?
[50:40] Are you going to pay the invoice that was sent? Would you do that from your own Dash Core Group funds?
[50:49] He didn't spell out what would happen if the proposal didn't pass is my main point.
[50:55] Anything else to add guys before we wrap this up? - One thing I would add is that both Brian Foster
[51:04] and Sam Westridge have commented that maintaining the trust
[51:09] isn't supposed to be a DCG Inc prerogative. And, but the fact that they are making,
[51:17] putting a bandwidth, allocating bandwidth to this effort in the past,
[51:21] and the fact that in the past, Sam Westridge has said that if the,
[51:27] you know, a proposal to fund the trustee doesn't pass, then DCG Inc will pull it out of their coffers.
[51:36] I mean, that to me just shows how sort of insidious or how necessary DCG Inc views the trust
[51:43] to perpetuate their current structure. And I think if anyone watching
[51:50] has been long involved with Dash, cares about the trust,
[51:53] if anyone watching has been long involved with Dash, cares about timely deliverables
[51:59] and effective communication, I think they should realize that we can do better
[52:03] and we should demand better. And so we should not support these options
[52:09] to perpetuate the trust or any extra legal structures around DCG.
[52:14] - I said, closing remarks. - Yeah, I mean, doing the hard thing,
[52:23] the DAO from any legal entanglements, it only makes us stronger.
[52:28] It's about anti-fragility. I think the DAO grows stronger
[52:33] by basically we grow stronger from adversity and we become very fragile
[52:41] when we're legally tied to some structure like we have now.
[52:46] And I guess it's a matter of, is it convenience or, you know,
[52:51] are we giving up so much just for convenience or for the short-term win
[52:59] or should we really look at the long-term win? And that's why I wouldn't vote option one.
[53:04] I feel like it's just continuation of what we have now. - Yep, all right.
[53:12] Well, with that, let's see. Let's one more comment here.
[53:15] Amanda says, yes, people should put in their own proposals if this one doesn't pass.
[53:20] Brian Foster's comment on Data Central. If this proposal does not pass,
[53:24] we will have to evaluate the comments and reasons why people felt that option one
[53:28] was not appropriate. And we or someone else would have to submit new proposals.
[53:32] So yeah, I would encourage people outside of DCG to feel like they can and even should
[53:40] put in their own proposals regarding this topic. So with that, I will say thank you, gentlemen,
[53:49] and we'll see what happens to this in the next 48 hours and go from there.
[53:57] Thanks everyone. - All right, much love.
[53:59] - Bye.
