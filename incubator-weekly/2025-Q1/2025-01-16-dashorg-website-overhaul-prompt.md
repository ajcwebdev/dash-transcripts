## Episode Description

Community members discuss a potential Dash.org website redesign, focusing on a fresh brand identity, improved user experience, and expanded community engagement.

## Episode Summary

This conversation centers on the possibility of rejuvenating Dash.org’s public face to better reflect its core mission and innovation within the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Participants highlight the importance of cohesive branding, from typography and logos to user-friendly design elements, and emphasize the need for consistent visuals across all Dash-related platforms. They also address how improved design could attract fresh interest from developers, casual users, and other stakeholders, sparking renewed conversations about usability and community growth. The discussion touches on the potential for a new brand guide, motion graphics, and more unified design principles for future apps and services. Ultimately, the objective is to reinforce Dash’s image as a forward-thinking project, encourage broader participation, and align diverse community goals under an updated, modernized aesthetic.

## Chapters

### 00:00 – 05:00 Introduction and Context

In the first few minutes, the hosts set the stage by welcoming viewers and introducing the guests, who bring years of design and development experience to the table. They reflect on their personal backgrounds, emphasizing the need to address issues on Dash.org that may hinder newcomers from fully appreciating Dash’s capabilities. This early portion sets a constructive tone for the entire session, as participants express excitement about improving digital aesthetics and user flows.

They stress that Dash’s public-facing platforms carry immense responsibility in shaping both veteran community members’ and newcomers’ impressions. By underscoring the concept of a strong user experience, the speakers establish a shared vision of making Dash more accessible and visually appealing. This leads naturally into discussions on how design modifications could provide new life for the brand, suggesting that a deliberate, community-driven process will be key.

### 05:00 – 10:00 Background on Dash Branding

During this segment, the conversation shifts to Dash’s current branding and how it evolved over the years. The guests note that the existing logo and identity guidelines have served their purpose but no longer feel fully aligned with modern design trends or the project’s forward momentum. They talk about the varied implementations of Dash’s visual elements across multiple platforms, pointing out inconsistencies that can confuse potential adopters.

By drawing comparisons with emerging projects in the crypto world, the speakers illustrate how fresh, cohesive branding can positively influence user perception. They discuss the challenges of unifying design systems and integrating them into established software. Above all, they highlight the risk of blending into the background of thousands of competing cryptocurrencies, underscoring the need to stand out through clarity and thoughtful design choices.

### 10:00 – 15:00 Proposed Overhaul Approach

Here, the hosts and guests outline their vision for a more expansive overhaul that goes beyond a simple face-lift. They propose starting with fundamental branding elements—like fonts, color palettes, and cohesive design language—that will form a solid foundation for any subsequent website or interface changes. This approach, they explain, ensures that each new Dash product or feature will reflect a consistent, polished standard.

The conversation also explores how these steps will be guided by input from the Dash community. Rather than imposing top-down decisions, they aim to gather extensive feedback through proposals and open forums. The goal is to create a participatory process, allowing masternode owners and community members to shape the outcome of any changes. It’s a method designed to maintain transparency, ownership, and excitement around the design evolution.

### 15:00 – 20:00 Team Experience and Portfolio

During this interval, the principal designers illustrate their track record with previous clients and large-scale design projects. They showcase examples of motion graphics, three-dimensional elements, and other creative assets that they believe could elevate Dash’s visual identity. Their enthusiasm is tangible, as they explain their philosophy of pouring artistry into every detail, from button styles to website transitions.

They underscore the importance of assembling a multidisciplinary team capable of delivering a range of creative outputs, from sleek product packaging to interactive landing pages. This broad expertise, they argue, can give Dash an edge in reaching new audiences while delighting its existing user base. Through their anecdotes, it becomes clear that the ambition goes beyond simply “looking good”—they aim to design digital experiences that engage and retain people over the long term.

### 20:00 – 25:00 Rationale for Rebranding Dash

In this segment, the guests make the case for why a rebrand could be transformative. They believe that an updated, carefully orchestrated visual identity can help the project reach a broader demographic. Their perspective suggests that in a rapidly shifting cryptocurrency landscape, evolving the brand is less about shedding tradition and more about embracing new opportunities for growth.

They also consider potential challenges, noting that any significant aesthetic change must be accompanied by practical updates to project infrastructure. The ultimate purpose of a rebrand, they assert, should be to strengthen trust, deliver clarity, and draw positive attention. This process involves balancing respect for Dash’s heritage with a willingness to experiment and adapt. By capturing a fresh yet authentic style, the project can reaffirm its longstanding values while positioning itself for the future.

### 25:00 – 30:00 Potential Deliverables and Next Steps

Here, the speakers detail some of the tangible outputs they envision for Dash’s design overhaul. Ideas include brand guidelines that codify new typography, color schemes, and iconography, as well as motion graphics that can be featured in videos or used as transitions between sections on a site. They emphasize how these deliverables will act as building blocks for any subsequent expansions of the Dash ecosystem.

To move forward, they propose a phased approach: first, gather community opinion on broad design directions, then refine concepts with multiple iterations. This transparent and iterative method aims to prevent sudden, unwanted changes by incorporating feedback at each step. Listeners gain a clear sense of how the plan might roll out and what role they can play in shaping the future of Dash’s brand presence.

### 30:00 – 35:00 Community Involvement and Discussion

In this portion, they underscore the critical role of the masternode owners and the broader Dash community in deciding whether the redesign should happen and to what extent. They encourage open dialogue, inviting both supportive and skeptical voices to weigh in on the direction. The proposal process is framed as collaborative, relying on democratic decision-making that truly represents stakeholder interests.

This emphasis on group input reflects the project’s decentralized ethos. The team assures listeners that they aim to provide options, including conservative routes that involve minimal changes and bolder paths that might significantly reshape Dash’s visual identity. By giving the community these varied possibilities, the conversation demonstrates respect for both Dash’s roots and the excitement of potential new horizons.

### 35:00 – 38:06 Closing Remarks and Future Plans

In the final moments, the guests reiterate their commitment to creating a thoughtful, user-friendly brand ecosystem that benefits everyone within Dash’s decentralized structure. They acknowledge that design is never a one-and-done process; it requires ongoing maintenance, experimentation, and refinement to keep pace with user needs and market dynamics.

They conclude by encouraging viewers and community members to stay engaged in the discussion, whether by voicing opinions on social channels or participating in upcoming votes. Their message is one of optimism: with the community’s guidance and a robust creative vision, Dash can revitalize its appearance, improve user accessibility, and reinforce its reputation as a pioneering force in the cryptocurrency space.

[00:00] the stream is live yes it is yes yes welcome everybody uh to a late
[00:00] episode of incubator
[00:09] weekly this week uh we've got today our good friend mikhail how's it going mikhail
[00:09] hey guys
[00:15] and uh down below but certainly not the lowest on the totem pole here uh
[00:15] we've got designer ceo
[00:23] bmd.gg yeah introduce yourself to us uh designer yes so my name is simeon you
[00:23] can call me bmd or
[00:33] designer and i'm the creative director in my design studio here in thailand so um
[00:33] yeah for the past
[00:41] two decades i was helping more than like 500 clients build their visions and i'm
[00:41] like that
[00:48] designer guy that always connects all the dots together to actually build something
[00:54] greater for developers so yeah i helped a lot of clients get to millions and
[00:54] billions of dollars so
[01:03] now it's time for dash so i'm really eager and energized to help dash get
[01:03] great again so yeah
[01:13] yeah yeah yeah i i like your answer um one thing i want to tell
[01:13] is for the chat like a huge huge thanks
[01:21] because like every time i post something in discord i got like a lot of
[01:21] reactions a lot of likes and
[01:28] people discuss it and people like it and i feel that i'm in the right
[01:28] spot like in other projects sometimes
[01:34] it's a bit messy but here i i feel like it's a huge need of
[01:34] quality pixels you know on the screen
[01:42] so i'm here to to do that together with michael like we have a strong
[01:42] team of developers that we can
[01:48] deliver project after project after project after project so prepare 2025 is the year of
[01:48] dash so
[01:57] not a financial advice but yeah keep track of what we are doing yeah and
[01:57] you've already proven yourself
[02:05] worthy by um doing so several designs uh the most prominent of which i think
[02:05] would be the platform
[02:12] explorer website at least for dash anyway uh that's the that's what most people would
[02:12] know your work from
[02:18] um and so you guys have worked together uh also just in case nobody else
[02:18] caught this caught that uh
[02:27] bmd stands for black mirror design designer um and why don't you just tell us
[02:27] how you and mikhail got to
[02:36] know each other real briefly and then you've got a slide deck that we'll jump
[02:36] right into after that
[02:42] so during the last two decades i built my community of developers and designers around
[02:42] the world so they
[02:50] all know about like what i can deliver what i can do and so on
[02:50] so they try to connect me with different
[02:57] interesting people so michael is basically one of the guys that got connected through one
[02:57] of my best
[03:04] developers like they actually live in the same city so it's basically a live reference
[03:04] when
[03:10] mikhail had the needs you know to to do something with platform explorer so we
[03:10] know him because uh i
[03:18] spent like two or three years working with other developers that they somehow connected over
[03:18] there so
[03:23] one three three seven peace to you and your family as well that's our friend
[03:30] nice nice nice all right so let's jump into your proposal i'm showing it on
[03:30] the screen right now so
[03:37] feel free to go go right ahead um actually before you jump in i'll just
[03:37] uh give people really high
[03:45] level context uh you guys contacted me said you had some ideas for um changing
[03:45] the dash.org website so
[03:55] that's a a big thing i do know that there was a recent uh redesign
[03:55] somewhat of a redesign not like
[04:02] an overhaul or anything like that but i think what you're proposing is is a
[04:02] design change um and then
[04:11] also michael you mentioned off show uh and in our messages that that might also
[04:11] involve uh changing
[04:20] the back end how it's implemented as well not just the the what people see
[04:20] in the in terms of the pixels
[04:26] but also uh re recoding it to have a modern tech stack so i'll let
[04:26] you um talk about that a little
[04:33] bit afterwards as well but let's jump into the your design proposal maybe we have
[04:33] we will have some
[04:41] introduction into into that first uh let me just have a little little intro sure
[04:41] so uh what uh so
[04:50] the topic uh yeah i called uh the shark website overhaul so what what we
[04:50] so uh yeah a lot of people
[05:01] not a lot but quite people was asking like uh we had a redesign recently
[05:01] but it's not really that fresh
[05:10] uh as it could be and that uh also depends on some uh on some
[05:10] things like resources and uh what cg
[05:24] is currently uh is currently uh focused on is the is the platform so the
[05:24] website is not the first priorities
[05:32] but it's like the first uh the face of the the shark website and i
[05:32] think um we we could go and like
[05:44] think about that like how can we make it better and we can do it
[05:44] on the we can we can do a whole
[05:53] redesign uh make a new website uh that will look fresh that will look modern
[05:53] um that have better uh
[06:03] like that will have a modern stack uh technology stack that will allow to uh
[06:03] make updates more frequent
[06:12] uh to make websites uh easily to update and stuff like that we could do
[06:12] it but um there is also another
[06:21] question if we if we if we uh want to make a new website we
[06:21] need to make a new design so
[06:29] we have uh current guidelines but they were last time refreshed like in 2018 the
[06:29] when the new dash logo
[06:42] was was created uh like the last new dash logo yeah and it would be
[06:42] a really really great
[06:51] to refresh our our branding our our guidelines um to make all of our future
[06:51] reps uh looks mobile modern
[07:04] looks more fresh uh and possibly uh redesign our current applications and you know just
[07:04] have a solid solid base
[07:13] uh for designing the new applications yeah that's what uh blackmailer designer uh wants to
[07:13] do yeah so
[07:22] thanks michael yeah this is basically um like the number one problem that we faced
[07:22] when we
[07:30] met each other like he showed me like all the projects that uh he was
[07:30] working on and he showed like all the other websites and stuff and for me
[07:30] dash was like a new project like i always knew about dash but i never
[07:42] never paid attention and to be honest until the first five calls like i i
[07:42] was confused because
[07:51] uh dash is basically the first dollar you know so it's like a big bullet
[07:51] point that nobody is talking
[07:59] about so the whole concept of dash right now in my vision like when i
[07:59] visit the website and stuff
[08:06] it's just another wallet you know you look like a layer two token you know
[08:06] like they even they have better
[08:12] websites you know like and the first time i did deeply into like the whole
[08:12] ecosystem like all the
[08:21] electron wallets all the dashboard wallets all everything i was clicking clicking clicking and
[08:28] so from a designer perspective that for two decades he was building pixels i got
[08:28] annoyed and but from
[08:34] the other part i was like oh there's a lot of uh place to work
[08:34] here so let's start small with
[08:41] platform explorer and then we will see what we can do next and from the
[08:41] first second i started digging
[08:48] in of course dash.org was the one of the website and it was actually before
[08:48] the the small redesign that
[08:54] you have right now so it was extremely outdated and it's not like yesterday we
[08:54] had this idea yeah let's
[09:02] make dash a better website no it's constant pain like everyday pain when you get
[09:02] inside on the website
[09:09] you try to download something blah blah you always get like this idea okay we
[09:09] are now working on platform
[09:13] explorer but we want to make some greater changes to improve like the overall user
[09:13] experience like for
[09:20] regular people for them to be able to just open from the phone and just
[09:20] start digging deeply into
[09:27] something beautiful something like uh strongly built by a strong dow you know like the
[09:27] proposal that i'm
[09:34] showing you right now it's not something that's from me personally like i will be
[09:34] working on branding
[09:40] it's because of huge experience and again connecting people and stuff i have like the
[09:40] best design agency
[09:47] it's valeri it's one of my friend that helped me with my design studios so
[09:47] he basically built branding
[09:54] for my design studio and after this i was using and making designs for other
[09:54] clients you know so
[09:59] right now we want to connect all the strongest people that i have in my
[09:59] connections to start working on a
[10:08] monthly basis for dash and just improve improve improve improve improve so you will be
[10:08] so constantly
[10:13] bombarded with design that you will have the same problem that have all my other
[10:13] clients okay design
[10:19] is done now now we need more developers you know so i want really to
[10:19] make a lot of designs new guide book
[10:27] new guides for the next apps and just start working on like a bootstrap for
[10:27] the next apps that will be
[10:35] build on dash platform and on dash layer one you know like we the focus
[10:35] here is not on like let's change
[10:41] some pixels and make like it pretty it's to focus seriously on the branding part
[10:41] so every time we
[10:49] deliver something on the internet we get some small maybe patterns maybe colors maybe fonts
[10:49] maybe like
[10:55] something that connects the those together so people understand okay this material is from dash
[10:55] this app is
[11:01] from dash this is from there so it's uh to make people understand dash is
[11:01] layer one dash is the father
[11:08] this is something like it's uh it's not like a altcoin and whatever it's something
[11:08] built to
[11:16] help people like get this into a dow understand how this dow works like if
[11:16] people don't know what this three
[11:26] letters mean please give it a good read because dow is basically the future of
[11:26] everything that can be
[11:32] built online like we are a decentralized organization that everybody can join and help us
[11:32] on this uh big
[11:39] mission and i'm amazed that no other designers joined to like help you push this
[11:39] so i'm happy to be like
[11:48] the one of the first spartans that will take this task on his shoulders and
[11:48] really like i have a lot of
[11:55] people that i still didn't connect to dash because we didn't have the you know
[11:55] the tasks for like more
[12:01] creative tasks you know like the more tasks we get the more people i can
[12:01] connect the more people will
[12:07] start helping and it will push further and further but um voron oil like the
[12:07] company right now from cyprus with
[12:16] valerian charge like the creative director like now we can show you what we uh
[12:16] want to propose so here
[12:24] you won't see any like uh ideas and stuff like we want to keep it
[12:24] for the next phase you know like we
[12:32] really want to make a show out of this you know like uh every month
[12:32] you get some new proposal from us
[12:38] but with variations so maybe we'll put post three proposals and for which will be
[12:38] voted we will move
[12:45] forward with that specific design you know so we really want to engage the tao
[12:45] and to make them a
[12:50] part of this uh expanding the branding and uh yeah and doing all this stuff
[12:50] so let's dive in into the
[12:59] presentation i think it's more than enough for the introduction and who we do so
[12:59] we're really like a
[13:06] uh multi-disciplinary design team yeah like we we have so many creators like just bombard
[13:06] us with tasks
[13:13] and we will be working on improving it and branding is the first step in
[13:13] this like through all the plan
[13:22] that i have right in my my mind like the um improving the first steps
[13:22] with branding with dash with like
[13:29] guides rules buttons style guides like atom design and stuff will help us move towards
[13:29] um pushing every
[13:37] project faster and faster and faster because you will have the guides you'll have the
[13:37] bootstrap you know
[13:41] so uh specifically um valeri with me on this task we want to focus on
[13:41] three uh three points like the
[13:52] branding the motion design and campaigns like for social media like we want to create
[13:52] the um
[13:57] branding that will connect like everything like like i said before every time you see
[13:57] something you
[14:03] understand it's from dash it's from this it's from that so we really want to
[14:03] focus on all of the
[14:10] points like what we want to do here um like i said i had a
[14:10] lot of interesting clients as well but valeri with
[14:18] his uh voronoid studio like he's working with big big big big names like this
[14:18] but i'm really proud to bring
[14:26] him on board to show actually something interesting because if you just look at the
[14:26] quality that this guy is
[14:34] presenting his stuff like i was always amazed like for me it's uh like reading
[14:34] a new book every time valeri
[14:41] presents a new projects from his uh team and his portfolio so i really want
[14:41] like this quality of design
[14:48] this quality of uh ideology of 3d rendering like not some stock images stock mock-ups
[14:48] stock 3d stuff like
[14:58] crafted crafted crafted crafted with a big experience big soul and put effort into every
[14:58] single details like
[15:05] uh okay let's go video
[15:10] yay so really like all this glass morphism this uh with gradients with minimalism with
[15:10] like we just enjoy
[15:22] this like doing the quality of like the top top top brands around the world
[15:22] that's the sample of assets
[15:29] that uh you could do right this is the work that valeri did for other
[15:29] clients so this is our portfolio
[15:37] let's say with 3ds and all the banners all the animations micro animations like really
[15:37] adore to do some
[15:43] small icons and do micro animations inside the interface like to make the interface look
[15:43] alive
[15:49] like this is where are we focused on like the small tiny details that make
[15:49] the product pretty and uh
[15:58] connect all the dots so this is what i really wish for dash you know
[15:58] from my perspective like from
[16:04] as a designer like i want to to see pretty i want to see that
[16:04] everything works in like one organism and
[16:13] it's everything from from the dash itself so this is what we want to offer
[16:13] like
[16:18] crypto industry is evolving yeah so we really need to look at others like i
[16:18] said before the
[16:26] layer 2 tokens or whatever other sheet coins they have a better design and better
[16:26] branding than
[16:35] most of their ones so we really need to focus on being on the same
[16:35] page with other top projects like
[16:42] we want to compete not to be pointing fingers like ah they are stuck in
[16:42] 2017 you know so
[16:50] yeah the solution that we want to present like about the logo refresh is it's
[16:50] optional like the logo is
[17:01] something we understand that it's put everything like we have it everywhere in all the
[17:01] other apps and
[17:05] stuff so if we really want to come up with a different logo sign it
[17:05] needs to be super bold like i really
[17:13] want to present some ideas and make this show on dash central so people will
[17:13] just vote and see maybe people
[17:22] vote okay we like this idea with the logo or no we don't want to
[17:22] change the logo only a bit to color
[17:28] refresh and refresh and fonts like the fonts is something super important like people leave
[17:28] it at the end
[17:34] but fonts are something that we use to understand the product and see and diversify
[17:34] it from others
[17:41] you know so when it's something like montserraten that we have right now is like
[17:41] the cheap rip off of
[17:46] gotham pro that's a paid font uh we look a bit um clumsy in the
[17:46] eyes of people that can understand like the
[17:58] difference between fonts they saw this monster out on two million other websites you know
[17:58] so we are not
[18:02] having a branding we just have something that um we need something because we need
[18:02] this and the phone
[18:09] should be free because no why phone should be free let's just get some budget
[18:09] for a good font and just buy
[18:17] it you know full license for dash and it will be like the dash font
[18:17] and every time we post something we use the
[18:22] dash font that's multi-langual and has the commercial license and we're nice we can use
[18:22] it in the apps and
[18:31] stuff and not like okay what kind of fonts should we use for our apps
[18:31] like we really need to um make
[18:39] everything like check check check check check check check then we have like a big
[18:39] bag of designs brand colors
[18:45] fonts of fonts up this layout templates like and people will just start using its
[18:45] atom design like
[18:51] one atom from here one atom from here and just create new new apps you
[18:51] know based on good guides
[18:56] and if we will have good guides at the beginning all the other products products
[18:56] will just start looking
[19:01] good from the start because good foundation and like why they should rebrand its logo
[19:01] i think i already
[19:12] answered but we have still some points like modernize from a competitive edge differentiate crowded
[19:12] market
[19:20] how many icons we have with logos on coinmarketcap like 10 000 you know and
[19:20] we had like this idea from
[19:28] one of the community member i don't remember his name but he said like look
[19:28] on coinmarketcap you have
[19:35] gif animations we can make some gif animations for dash as well to just
[19:40] differentiate like very different you know like compete like show that people scroll and then
[19:40] boom
[19:45] small animation oh dash something new wow click on new website wow new wallet wow
[19:45] like this the whole
[19:52] concept like okay we were building before we have like a stack now we need
[19:52] to make this step beautiful
[19:58] like online with dash evolution just evolve appeal to a broader audience like i really
[19:58] don't want to
[20:06] focus like other are doing like we need only developers so let's build all the
[20:06] products that
[20:11] look like a bit clumsy but the developers they know how to hack google so
[20:11] they can open any app or they
[20:17] can use terminal to update the app or to install something no no not these
[20:17] kind of people like
[20:23] everything we are proposing right now is for this small step towards like the mass
[20:23] adoption you know like
[20:29] better ideas better ideas better design easier flow easier like buy transfer voila then we
[20:29] have a product
[20:38] that can grow you know enhance digital and social presence like build trust like the
[20:38] the redesign and
[20:46] revamping like the overhaul of the website will bring only like good things from my
[20:46] perspective and we
[20:52] will try to make the website load in 0.2 seconds but we will try to
[20:52] optimize and use only like svgs and
[20:59] there are some tactics and strategies that i don't want to like bombard right now
[20:59] but we want to make
[21:06] this product super easily accessible from around like every single tablet smartphone on 3g whatever
[21:06] you
[21:15] click you open you already know where to click to download the wallet you really
[21:15] want to focus on this stuff
[21:22] and uh yeah we want to make a show from this to work with the
[21:22] community like the dow it's not me it's not my
[21:32] personal opinion and my personal taste in design whatever no we really want to understand
[21:32] the whole pain of the
[21:39] community work and every month we will just present more and more and more and
[21:39] more and the only thing i um want to ask from the
[21:47] community is just support and understanding that this is done because we want to make
[21:47] it better like
[21:54] better better better every time with every project that we build we want to make
[21:54] dash better to stay
[22:00] relevant accessible greater adoption that's that's the the key why we are building this so
[22:00] the result will be
[22:09] like uh improving the brand awareness right like when we drop this uh rebranding like
[22:09] uh michael and uh
[22:17] some other guys they actually told me this uh question yeah but when we do
[22:17] the rebranding people will
[22:24] start uh getting on the website and then they will see the other projects that
[22:24] they are not so good so why do
[22:30] we need people you know uh maybe it's not that bad that we will get
[22:30] attention from people maybe this is
[22:39] why we're doing like this to get attention from people and like to get these
[22:39] comments like guys we
[22:46] are new people we uh came to your website download the wallet and we don't
[22:46] like this you know like we get
[22:52] some feedback from new people not the same one that boils in like the discord
[22:52] community but more more
[22:59] people come fresh ideas fresh designers maybe we'll get more designers because more people more
[22:59] attention
[23:06] and just have a bigger team through delivery more designs for for dash so yeah
[23:06] this is basically what we
[23:13] want to do like in two three months to just focus every month and push
[23:13] something like start with brand
[23:19] guidelines then some static layouts then some motion layouts and some swag like t-shirts hoodies
[23:19] and stuff
[23:26] like really want to make a nice product so thank you for your time
[23:31] uh sorry i was on mute can we back up one slide um i know
[23:31] that some people probably noticed
[23:42] a price here which is what people probably think most of but is this uh
[23:47] this is the total price for the branding overhaul with all of this deliverable so
[23:47] this is not about
[23:58] the website itself it's like the branding presentation because in our big uh journey of
[23:58] improving dash
[24:04] the first step that i want to focus is actually branding because having a new
[24:04] branding we will have new
[24:09] icons and graphics and stuff and we will have like a huge base to actually
[24:09] make the redesign happen you
[24:14] know so every time we build something with uh valeria yeah it's it's the first
[24:14] step branding it's always
[24:21] the first step and by the way this price is just like uh i would
[24:21] say uh it's a proposal to understand like
[24:29] something in between like from five to fifteen you know it all depends on what
[24:29] we decide to do you know
[24:36] so this is like the preproposal phase okay now um you mentioned a couple times
[24:36] in in the uh the
[24:44] presentation something about multiple proposals tell us a little bit what your process would be
[24:44] because i know
[24:53] that i know that i know that some people are probably thinking like why why
[24:53] would we need a new a new a new
[25:00] logo the one that we have sometimes we're still trying to get partners to catch
[25:00] up to our quote new logo
[25:10] uh and we see our old logo from like seven years ago still in a
[25:10] lot of places um so what would be your
[25:19] proposal process in terms of like i also noticed that you you mentioned that the
[25:19] logo change was
[25:25] optional but let's just assume that people didn't want the logo or how would you
[25:25] how would you assess
[25:32] what people want and what people don't want are you going to put in a
[25:32] series of governance proposals
[25:37] where it's just like one dash give us uh give us an idea of what
[25:37] the community wants to does the
[25:44] community want us to even uh pursue this at all um give us a give
[25:44] us a vote for that give us a vote for
[25:52] whether or not you think uh we should change the logo what kinds of governance
[25:52] proposals and what's
[25:59] the overall process that you plan to pursue here exactly like uh everything you said
[25:59] like it's
[26:05] specifically the the idea that i have behind like it's uh governance uh proposals for
[26:05] one dash and just
[26:13] understanding the whole energy of the community like we i'm making this uh logo not
[26:13] for myself not for
[26:21] valeri not for you not for michael for the dow you know and we have
[26:21] this um tool to get the proofs or
[26:28] disapproves from the doubt you know so uh from the second i saw this mechanism
[26:28] working i was like okay
[26:36] so it's cool we can propose like three options and the one that will be
[26:36] like voted on we will pursue this
[26:42] path you know so every month every proposals that uh will be from other people
[26:42] you will see a proposal
[26:51] from black mirror designer no we will see how the we will uh organize if
[26:51] i'm too dumb to organize from
[26:59] black mirror designer you will see over there so i never posted anything in proposal
[26:59] so it will be
[27:05] something new for me as well but the whole concept is to gradually showcase to
[27:05] the dow what we can do
[27:14] ask them what they actually feel they need it mostly and focus our attention on
[27:14] that one branding is the
[27:21] first thing i personally want to emphasize the attention on because this will bring a
[27:21] lot of
[27:28] attention from the from all the community every time something new appears people discuss it
[27:28] you know so
[27:33] it's a good uh information info poet obviously it's a info
[27:40] just another reason to bombard everybody in twitter and say dash has a new logo
[27:40] new logo new logo and
[27:48] we get people attention you know then they click and they see a new website
[27:48] then they click on download
[27:52] it and they see a nice download page they download an app they see a
[27:52] new new app you know and i really want to
[28:00] work on every single step not today not tomorrow but constantly i just want to
[28:00] understand okay dash
[28:06] really needs me dash really needs like my creative talented partners that i have and
[28:06] just constantly
[28:12] adding adding adding adding adding up some some stuff and every pixel will bring us
[28:12] closer to the moon
[28:20] this is how i feel okay um now when you say branding is there something
[28:20] besides a logo
[28:29] change that would be branding uh because i'll just be i've i i was there
[28:29] for our last uh logo uh debate
[28:40] and i'll just tell you it was long and it was not easy um so
[28:40] it will be a little bit of an uphill battle to
[28:51] change the logo at this point but what what could um not saying that you
[28:51] shouldn't try to ask people
[28:59] about that but what might be involved outside of a logo change that you could
[28:59] you know help improve
[29:06] dash's image or is it like logo or nothing no no no no logo is
[29:06] just uh like i said optional so the overall
[29:15] will be branding like what's included inside branding it's all the deliverables that you see
[29:15] right now like
[29:21] brand guidelines plus files it's like a huge pdf file that you have right now
[29:21] from 2017 when you made the
[29:28] redesign uh the brand book same brand book that will include new colors new fonts
[29:28] new patterns you know
[29:36] like small things that you can reuse in all your creatives you know like this
[29:36] is what's branding like
[29:43] branding is small clues small patterns small lines small that connect everything together so what
[29:43] we
[29:49] want to offer is like present different approaches you know like in this um every
[29:49] time we want to propose
[29:55] something we will give ideas like we can move left we can move right we
[29:55] can go black we can go white
[30:01] you know like and always we'll have some uh possibilities for people to just say
[30:01] okay i don't
[30:06] like this one i like this one you know thumbs down thumbs up and based
[30:06] on this thumbs down thumbs up we will
[30:11] just understand okay we are shifting towards this and just move together with the community
[30:11] towards like
[30:18] every decision is made together with the community like i don't want to be like
[30:18] no i like this logo so
[30:25] much i don't whatever you say no no no okay community doesn't like this logo
[30:25] let's do a new one you know
[30:31] this will be the approach like i'm looking at the dao as the client you
[30:31] know and for me it's so easy to
[30:38] work with clients and to understand their vision you know and just i have really
[30:38] talented designers
[30:44] together and like valerian his team was so amazing and i just find some paths
[30:44] that we can take and like
[30:54] okay let's move towards this one and present let's move to this present this one
[30:54] to present and in this
[30:59] flow we will just get the opinions from the dow and move forward accordingly like
[30:59] eventually if we deliver
[31:06] something that the whole doubt doesn't like then it's a red you know and dash
[31:06] central and we don't get
[31:15] money so um anything except uh a new logo and brand guidelines uh i see
[31:15] in deliverables layout templates
[31:27] and motion layout motion yes exactly what is it exactly motion design is some brand
[31:36] branding attributes that can be added inside like videos like this for example ryan every
[31:36] time you
[31:42] change the screen uh you can insert the video that will be like the breaking
[31:42] you know like dash dash and
[31:50] you then change the screen and it's not only like you know like this uh
[31:50] clumsy but it will be with an
[31:56] amazing animation you know like uh animated backgrounds in the video you know dash connected
[31:56] animated wallpapers
[32:03] animated banners you know like everything that's related motion design like i showed you in
[32:03] the
[32:07] presentation i've told the coins that were like we can do a lot it all
[32:07] depends on what we need today
[32:16] and i just understand we need today like fresh branding to just show a new
[32:16] path that we can all take
[32:24] and just move accordingly and just move accordingly to the new path this is what
[32:24] okay so so what will be your
[32:31] first step toward trying to navigate the dao and find out uh the will and
[32:31] the desires of of the dao members
[32:40] what do you have any idea of what your first uh network proposal might be
[32:47] um this is actually the pre-proposal like actually the first thing i will do i
[32:47] will be constantly
[32:54] monitoring the comments on this video and i will find their nickname and find in
[32:54] discord and i will talk to
[33:02] them and uh if someone right now will write a comment and uh and will
[33:02] understand the nickname like let's just
[33:09] talk like we are a dower and we can talk we can start a talking
[33:09] brainstorm for example and connect people
[33:18] in discord in the brainstorm chat and yeah see where this will lead because we
[33:18] have um
[33:25] a questionnaire from valeri that helps him a lot you know so i am basically
[33:25] the one that's gonna
[33:34] write down all the answers to his questions you know and the community will help
[33:34] me get some answers
[33:41] because i don't want to make something that only i would like i want to
[33:41] make something the community will
[33:46] enjoy you know and um the next step will be after getting like this uh
[33:46] first uh questionnaire and
[33:54] research from like all the people that are interested in helping me and helping us
[33:54] with valeri is to
[34:01] actually sketch it like one of the next proposal will be some raw sketches with
[34:01] uh crayon you know with
[34:08] pencil and with some raw ideas you know and this is like the deliverables the
[34:08] first deliverables are
[34:17] ideas you know presenting these ideas with some text maybe we can make another video
[34:17] call and i can present
[34:23] a new presentation then we can attach the images to like three different proposals and
[34:23] people will say
[34:29] okay we like these ideas these drawings or we don't like anyone just go another
[34:29] month and work more you know
[34:36] maybe this will be the case but yeah i would suggest trying to open up
[34:36] a small you know a small poll
[34:45] on discord and just getting a temperature of the the whole space about should we
[34:45] pursue this uh this
[34:53] direction or should we uh you know keep working under michael and just doing design
[34:53] work for
[34:59] for his projects um what kind of vision do do people in the discord want
[34:59] and at that point then maybe move
[35:07] on to the uh making a governance proposal so all the mnos can can check
[35:07] that out if that seems warranted from
[35:17] the discord poll so that that's kind of what i would suggest um but we're
[35:17] gonna probably keep the show a
[35:24] little on the shorter side today but what what else did you want to mention
[35:24] about uh this proposal this
[35:31] idea uh before we shut off the uh the show tonight um i think i
[35:31] spoke even more than than needed like if
[35:41] someone actually watched it till the end like big thanks and uh let's talk in
[35:41] discord everyone that has
[35:49] ideas everyone that is like wow this school just just write it in discord just
[35:49] ping me no matter like
[35:56] one time or 100 times doesn't matter ping me ping me i i'm there um
[35:56] i have some maybe some final notes
[36:06] some comments on this uh yeah uh generally i think that's a pretty good idea
[36:06] to have some um common stuff
[36:15] on uh design that will allow developers to make better apps better websites even not
[36:15] developers it will
[36:24] also help other people like uh maybe joel to make some tweets maybe for some
[36:24] other people to make
[36:31] presentations uh so it's not strictly only for developers and uh yeah it's it's it's
[36:31] very good uh
[36:39] good thing to start thinking of uh as a downside that might require some resources
[36:39] to implement that uh
[36:47] in applications so for example if we would like to redesign some other our current
[36:47] applications
[36:56] so yeah that's that's the road with uh some cons and pros so um but
[36:56] then i think it's a good idea to
[37:06] have discussion on so yeah and uh we'll try to reach out to to the
[37:06] community with such question uh and connect
[37:15] with uh as many necessary people as as we could like uh with community we
[37:15] will we already have connected with
[37:25] some people in this uh core group so yeah okay well thanks thanks guys for
[37:25] coming on um it was it's great
[37:35] to meet you simone um i always like matching faces with discord handles because i
[37:35] think the more real people
[37:44] we have in this community the better and um yeah so thanks for coming on
[37:44] the show i look forward to uh
[37:52] your comments and the discussion in uh in discord and we'll see everybody uh there
[37:52] and feel free to post
[38:01] a comment in the in the comment section on youtube we'll also check uh take
[38:01] a look at that as well so
[38:06] thanks everybody and we'll see you next week see you around you it was a
[38:06] pleasure
