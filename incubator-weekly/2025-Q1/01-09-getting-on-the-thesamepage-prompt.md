By examining real examples and personal experiences, the conversation demonstrates how individuals can unite around the idea of digital cash while retaining the warm, close-knit spirit that makes Dash stand out among other blockchain communities.

## Chapters

### 00:00 - 05:54 | Welcoming August Back

In this opening section, the host greets August and acknowledges his earlier involvement in the Dash community. They talk about his initial projects, particularly those aimed at teaching coding and blockchain fundamentals. August touches on why he stepped away from the network for a time and expresses gratitude for the warm environment that Dash fosters. This segment sets the tone by emphasizing the community’s willingness to accept returning members who are ready to share new ideas, highlighting the value of inclusive dialogue.

They also discuss the motivating factors behind August’s renewed commitment, focusing on how community support and shared goals can help reinvigorate engagement. By reflecting on past experiences, August reveals how he plans to leverage the technical knowledge he gained in other crypto circles. The conversation underscores a united desire to see Dash remain strong and vibrant by welcoming diverse talents and perspectives, stressing the power of a friendly, cohesive environment.

### 05:54 - 11:48 | Identifying Core Challenges

Here, the discussion shifts to specific issues facing the Dash ecosystem, such as voting turnout and effective communication among master node owners. Both speakers reflect on how voting mechanisms can become more approachable, pointing out that while Dash has traditionally done well compared to other DAOs, there is still potential to strengthen participation. They explore how simplicity and user-friendly tools might engage more voters, especially when proposals need constructive feedback.

A key theme is how to make governance more interactive and transparent. The conversation brings up potential incentive systems like rewarding voters or establishing daily or weekly community prompts that foster continuous interaction. The speakers advocate for smaller but impactful efforts that build trust and clarity, ensuring everyone has a voice. These strategies, they note, can further unify the network around shared objectives, enhancing the sense of belonging within Dash.

### 11:48 - 17:42 | Ideas to Increase Engagement

The speakers continue by outlining tangible ways to improve everyday participation. They suggest gamification techniques—ranging from daily questions to more structured “question of the day” initiatives—to spark conversation and creativity. The emphasis is on shaping a culture where every individual feels motivated to offer insights and vote on proposals, potentially through thoughtful reward systems or even random lotteries for voters.

In parallel, they consider how these methods might reinforce project funding. If master node owners are more engaged, developers seeking treasury support gain clearer feedback channels. This could lead to deeper collaborations and partnerships, where smaller-scale funding from individual node owners might bolster early-stage projects before submitting formal proposals. Ultimately, the speakers foresee an environment where continuous dialogue ensures effective decision-making, carrying Dash to greater heights as a truly people-powered network.

### 17:42 - 23:36 | Governance Hackathons and Collective Decision-Making

Next, the conversation examines “governance hackathons,” a novel concept focused on building innovative ways to manage communal decisions. August describes how structured, time-bound challenges can inspire developers to create solutions that improve voting tools, data visualization, or other aspects of protocol-level governance. The idea is to unify individuals around a concrete goal, producing proof-of-concept applications that could revolutionize how community members participate.

They also underscore the value of collaboration for these hackathons. By forming teams, sharing resources, and exchanging perspectives, participants could tackle technical and organizational issues more efficiently. While many blockchain ecosystems conduct technical hackathons, focusing on governance might differentiate Dash by reinforcing its pioneering approach to decentralized decision-making. This segment points to the broader importance of organized events in fostering a sense of community ownership and progress.

### 23:36 - 29:30 | Exploring the Waves Concept

In this portion, August shares an emerging initiative he calls the “waves protocol.” This approach envisions collaborative sprints, with community members rallying around a “wave” to coordinate tasks like funding rounds and development milestones. The concept aims to bolster collective action, so participants feel a shared sense of achievement when a project culminates successfully. Waves might involve everything from short-term promotional efforts to extensive coding cycles, uniting people around a common banner.

By introducing structured phases—like creating a wave ID, forming teams, and inviting contributors—August hopes to provide a roadmap for how the Dash community can organize itself. The main goal is streamlined coordination, ensuring no one is overlooked and everyone understands how their efforts align with broader objectives. This idea aligns well with Dash’s ethos of community empowerment, reinforcing the strong sense of mutual trust and focus on real-world outcomes.

### 29:30 - 35:24 | Influences from Other Blockchains

Here, the conversation broadens to compare Dash’s inclusive environment with the more expansive, fast-moving culture August encountered in Solana. While Solana boasts a sizable builder community, it can sometimes feel impersonal and overly corporate in its strategy. In contrast, Dash offers a close-knit setting where individuals are quickly recognized and supported for their contributions. The speakers reflect on how best to balance the energetic drive seen in larger networks with the warmth and accessibility found in Dash.

By gleaning lessons from outside projects, they see potential to amplify Dash’s reach without compromising its core values. The focus remains on a user-friendly, welcoming approach that encourages people to test ideas confidently. They conclude that combining some of the ambitious development culture of other chains with Dash’s tight community bonds could spur fresh innovations, positioning Dash as a model for sustainable crypto governance.

### 35:24 - 41:18 | Showcasing New Tools and Prototypes

In this segment, August demonstrates prototypes he’s been developing, including crowdfunding pages and a fun game inspired by Flappy Bird. These experiments highlight how small but practical applications can bring life to a crypto community. Through interactive designs and real-time donation tools, participants get hands-on experience with Dash. Such hands-on activities also cultivate a sense of shared ownership and excitement, as even casual games can illustrate the basics of decentralized technology.

Discussions focus on integrating leaderboards and faucets, thereby rewarding engaged community members and encouraging them to deepen their involvement. August underscores the importance of polished, straightforward user experiences that lower entry barriers. By previewing these prototypes, the conversation illustrates how step-by-step innovations might accumulate into a broader, thriving ecosystem of Dash-based projects.

### 41:18 - 47:12 | The Same Page Platform

Turning attention to August’s primary vision, “the same page,” the talk highlights its core functions: creating dedicated pages for community discussions, coordinating group efforts, and matching project founders with sponsors. August proposes that each page serve as a living repository of ideas and progress updates, where participants can rally behind proposals and shape them collectively. This centralized but open interface could be a powerful resource for matching talent and funding.

They discuss how the platform can help organize the Dash community more effectively, giving supporters a one-stop solution to discover new proposals and provide direct feedback. The ultimate objective is to form a transparent, interactive space that maintains Dash’s spirit of shared responsibility. By consolidating updates, forging clearer communication channels, and rewarding constructive participation, the same page aims to raise the bar for user engagement and overall project quality.

### 47:12 - 54:22 | Looking Ahead

In the final chapter, August expresses gratitude for the community’s willingness to welcome him back after a hiatus. He emphasizes his personal goal of earning renewed trust by consistently contributing actionable ideas and prototypes. The conversation circles back to how vital it is for individuals to find a comfortable place within Dash where they can test, grow, and collaborate with like-minded peers.

They close by discussing next steps, including how August might partner with the incubator and eventually stand on his own with a direct proposal to Dash’s treasury. This concluding dialogue brings together the episode’s overarching themes: the power of genuine community bonds, the potential of supportive governance structures, and the promise of open-minded collaboration. Ultimately, it underscores the belief that a passionate, tightly woven network can keep Dash at the forefront of decentralized innovation.

## Transcript

[00:00] Okay, welcome everybody to a Wednesday episode of Incubator Weekly. Today on the show, we've
[00:00] got
[00:08] August Dimanchik. How's it going, August? Hey, what's up, Ryan? How's it going?
[00:13] It's going good. Yeah, thanks for jumping on with me. I just saw you recently
[00:13] rejoin
[00:22] the Dash community. You've been around for a long time, a while. Had some other
[00:22] things going
[00:29] on apparently for a couple years maybe, and now you're back. So just wanted to
[00:29] say welcome back
[00:37] and thanks for joining back again. It's always great to have more community. The more
[00:37] community,
[00:43] the better. And Dash is kind of known for having a good, vibrant community, especially
[00:43] for the size
[00:51] of our project. I think it punches above its weight in that respect. But yeah,
[00:51] let us know.
[00:58] Tell us about your journey a little bit and where you've been in terms of
[00:58] Dash and what's
[01:07] got the fire in your belly recently. All right. So just a little bit of
[01:07] background
[01:13] of anybody that's new or just learning about me. So I had a project in
[01:13] the past through the
[01:19] Dash style called Bit2byte. And that was a STEM education and mentorship program where we
[01:19] would
[01:30] have older students run classes for younger students, like high school, college students.
[01:34] And we were teaching some of the basics of coding and introducing blockchain.
[01:43] And I know there's a little bit of ground that I need to kind of
[01:43] explain. But just for some background,
[01:54] I got into a pretty tough place a few years ago and I was going
[01:54] through some stuff internally.
[02:01] And it and I passed everything along to my co-founder and kind of went separate
[02:01] ways with
[02:08] that. And I know that's kind of I know that there's probably some people and
[02:08] probably some
[02:13] master note owners and community members that kind of hold a grudge over that. And
[02:13] I'm I'm here to come
[02:20] back and I'm here to give. I want to learn what opportunities I can take
[02:20] on, what I can help with.
[02:26] I'm here to kind of build up, build trust again. I'm here to prove myself.
[02:26] I've got some experience
[02:33] over the years now. I've been learning a lot and I've still been in the
[02:33] blockchain space. I've been
[02:39] within some other communities. I've been I was with the Solana community for a while
[02:39] and getting some
[02:45] experience there. And I want to kind of take some of my perspective and share
[02:45] it with the community.
[02:50] And so I'm working on a few projects.
[02:55] And this is kind of I want to start a new chapter and I'm looking
[02:55] to kind of bring bring back the energy
[03:02] and momentum that we had. Like you were saying, this community, it kind of stands
[03:02] out like nothing is really
[03:08] like the Dash community like we we have this like strong mindset kind of internally.
[03:15] And I really I I miss those vibes like I miss that energy. And so
[03:15] I'm looking to try to see if I can
[03:22] help to bring that back. I posted on Twitter the other day saying how like
[03:28] the cool thing about Dash is that it's very like voice and community driven. It's
[03:28] like it's very driven
[03:38] by the people by the community, the people that use it. And I was saying
[03:38] how like we we should be this is
[03:45] kind of to get like philosophical and all that. But like the world, I don't
[03:45] think should be run by money.
[03:52] It should be run by people. And I think Dash does a good job of
[03:52] like highlighting and empowering people to
[03:58] kind of take on different roles and and to kind of be a leader. And
[03:58] that's what I was saying.
[04:05] Like this community has a really kind of deep soul and spirit and I want
[04:05] to kind of harness that and I want to
[04:14] kind of get the conversation going again. So that's what I'm here with my project
[04:14] called the same page.
[04:19] And what I was working on with that is a kind of an idea sharing
[04:19] platform. So originally I wanted to make
[04:27] it like a social media platform, you know, for getting on the same page and
[04:27] having like a button
[04:32] on pages and threads where you can say I'm on the same page and then
[04:32] kind of having like engagement and
[04:39] like what's the word kind of be consensus driven. So it kind of be a
[04:39] platform for making decisions,
[04:46] deciding things together. And so that's what I wanted to get into, maybe build for
[04:46] the DashDAO.
[04:54] So that's my presentation here. You can see my screen, correct?
[04:58] Not yet. But just before you jump into that, what's your what's your Twitter profile
[04:58] x.com slash?
[05:05] It's August James D. And then our the the other one is the same dot
[05:05] page is our
[05:13] for our project.
[05:21] And so that's my goal with the same page is to kind of get the
[05:21] Dash community on the same page about things,
[05:27] kind of increase engagement and kind of spark the conversation.
[05:32] And I think this could be like a tool and a resource for the Dash
[05:32] community where we could vote on things like that's one of my
[05:40] biggest things I want to help with is increasing voting engagement and voting on proposals.
[05:47] I think it's going to be the same idea for how I can do that
[05:47] with the same page.
[05:52] Also, the website is still it's kind of temporary.
[05:55] It's like a preview of our website and services.
[05:55] So I'm looking to build another one.
[05:57] It doesn't it's not set up to work.
[06:02] You can go to the website, but you can't create a profile or an account
[06:02] yet.
[06:07] So let me know when you can see my screen.
[06:13] Yeah.
[06:14] Yeah.
[06:15] Let's just say hello to Black Mirror Designer.
[06:18] Thanks for saying good night.
[06:19] It's a good morning for me.
[06:21] It's a good afternoon ish for you, I think, August.
[06:26] You're in Chicago, right?
[06:28] Yes.
[06:29] And also, before we forget, you're actually you're also looking for local people around the
[06:35] Chicago area to work with in in this endeavor of yours.
[06:39] And just for context, just before I forget, also, I'm having you on the show
[06:39] because my my
[06:46] purpose in Dash right now is to try to foster what what people like you
[06:46] are
[06:51] trying to do, where you're trying to gather some community, get get people together on
[06:51] the
[06:57] same page with projects building on and around Dash and cryptocurrency in general.
[07:04] And yeah, like that's totally my vision as well as is that the people are
[07:04] the most important
[07:11] part of a project.
[07:14] And if you have a good if you have a good base of people that
[07:14] are, you know, to use your
[07:19] phrase on the same page about something in Dash, I think it's pretty pretty easy
[07:19] to be on
[07:24] the same page because we have such a good brand.
[07:28] We have that brand of digital cash.
[07:31] And that's something that almost everybody can really get behind because our monetary systems
[07:37] used to be cash and everybody kind of loves that idea of cash of being
[07:37] a private, something
[07:46] that you own kind of thing.
[07:49] But as we're moving into the digital realm, it's important that we have a digital
[07:49] version
[07:54] of what cash used to be.
[07:56] So that's why we can kind of be on the same page in the Dash
[07:56] community about at least that
[08:01] fundamental level.
[08:03] But before we yeah, before anything else, let's jump right into your presentation and
[08:09] let's let's let's have it.
[08:11] So now everybody's now seeing your your slides.
[08:15] Okay, cool.
[08:17] So I have kind of two main initiatives and projects that I'm that I'm working
[08:17] on.
[08:24] So one is the same page and then one is something that I was thinking
[08:24] about is a protocol and
[08:30] a framework for coordination called waves.
[08:33] But then in this document, I kind of just have a collection of like ideas
[08:33] that I think could
[08:39] help us out at this point that we're in.
[08:42] And so one of those is okay, so let's let's get on the same page.
[08:49] And what I really want to do with the same page is kind of talk
[08:49] about what we need the
[08:53] most what we need to build the most what's the the one of the or
[08:53] like some of the strongest
[08:59] models that we can build and focus on as a community.
[09:03] And so one of the problems that I hope to solve is low masternode voting
[09:03] turnout and engagement.
[09:09] There's a few ways I think we can solve this, but one I would like
[09:09] to make the same page kind
[09:15] of an extra like a forum for the dash community and dash voters to communicate
[09:15] and kind of build.
[09:25] My long term vision is I really want to help help us build like policies
[09:25] like policies within
[09:30] the Dow.
[09:31] And so I'm thinking this can be kind of a way where we can create
[09:31] those and discuss those
[09:37] and vote on those.
[09:40] And my other idea.
[09:41] Wait, before you jump forward with the solution, just real quick, if I could ask
[09:41] some questions
[09:45] every now and then.
[09:48] I want to I want to stick with the problem for just a little bit.
[09:51] If you want to back up just one one one slide.
[09:54] Yeah, and the problem.
[09:56] Low masternode voting turnout and engagement.
[09:59] So let's like we got some time.
[10:02] We're only 10 minutes in and I think you have like a 15 or 20
[10:02] minute presentation.
[10:07] So let's let's take a little bit of time making sure that we are on
[10:07] the same page about the
[10:15] problem.
[10:17] because personally, you know, when it comes to voting.
[10:20] I do see that there could definitely be more voters, but I also see that
[10:20] we actually have a
[10:27] pretty engaged community in terms of voting when you compare it to alternatives like maybe
[10:34] other other DOWs, I think are complete ghost towns or controlled by only only a
[10:34] few whales or VCs and VCs
[10:45] and their friends that that kind of started the coin.
[10:48] I've noticed I've been in I've been in and working in the DAO, the DASHDAO
[10:48] for years now.
[10:55] And I've noticed that, yes, the participation has gone down a little bit, but the
[10:55] engagement of those
[11:02] involved is almost as good as it's ever been.
[11:08] So I just wanted to put some some of my own framing around the problem,
[11:08] because I think, let's see you.
[11:19] Right now you need about 300 votes for a proposal in our DAO to pass,
[11:19] and there are.
[11:29] about like that's 10% of the voting of the voting master of the masternodes themselves.
[11:36] It's a little bit weird because there's two different types of masternodes now.
[11:41] But why don't you why don't you dig a little deeper and tell us more
[11:41] from your perspective what the
[11:47] problem is in that context, like what what do you want to see a little
[11:47] bit more of?
[11:52] So I think it goes back to really the roots of like blockchain and what
[11:52] it enables us to do.
[12:00] And and that's like make decisions together and kind of.
[12:05] And verify things together and what.
[12:09] What I want to do is try to create like a culture of engagement, like
[12:09] a culture of like people.
[12:21] Discussing and talking and kind of like a consensus driven community.
[12:27] And and and I think that we could even offer like rewards or incentives for
[12:27] voting.
[12:35] So like we could gamify it, add like a like a point system.
[12:38] You could even have it so that the amount of voters every month determines like
[12:38] an extra fund
[12:44] or pool or something or like a bonuses.
[12:47] And I think there's a lot of ways that we could could could do that.
[12:51] But what I want to create is like this culture of like collective decision making.
[12:56] And what I want to do.
[12:58] So one of my thoughts was a we can start with like a question of
[12:58] the day and just ask like a like a question.
[13:09] What I wanted to do is on the same page website is like create a
[13:09] question for the dash community,
[13:15] the master node owners, and then we could reward dash to some of like the
[13:15] top answers or people could vote on on that and kind of do
[13:25] do these like daily questions and kind of get the community.
[13:28] And and what I want to do, too, is kind of like log that, like
[13:28] the community's answers to those questions.
[13:37] And that can kind of be like a an alignment tool that the dash community
[13:37] could use.
[13:43] So that's one of my ideas, like a question of the day.
[13:46] I know it's not like it's just it's a simple thought.
[13:48] But I think that has like a lot of potential and it's like it's what
[13:48] we make it right.
[13:53] And people can vote on the questions that they have.
[13:55] Like they could submit questions ahead of time.
[13:57] We can make it like a question of the week, too, or like an important
[13:57] decision or important question.
[14:04] And the other big thing is give us an example.
[14:07] Give us an example question.
[14:08] I'm thinking of things already.
[14:11] I think this is a great idea, like because it's both informative and fun.
[14:15] But give us an example of a question of the day that you might come
[14:15] up with.
[14:20] Like.
[14:22] Question of the day.
[14:27] Like an example of one could be.
[14:34] How do we.
[14:37] I mean, the one that we're answering right now, how do we increase engagement or
[14:37] voter participation?
[14:44] The other one could be how do we stand out as a community or like
[14:44] as a network?
[14:49] How do we kind of differentiate ourselves from the other networks and blockchains?
[14:53] The others.
[14:54] Another question could be like, what makes Dash Dash?
[14:57] Like what makes us kind of in that, you know, kind of stand out?
[15:03] And what and like what what we could be.
[15:06] I think that's the other thing is like ask questions, like get the community.
[15:09] And this is a shared collective vision.
[15:11] We should be making a collective vision for Dash, like as a community.
[15:15] And so one of the things we could ask is like, what could Dash be
[15:15] known for?
[15:19] Or like what, you know, what could be like our.
[15:24] You know, our pillars like our foundations.
[15:26] So that's kind of my goal with like the question.
[15:29] And I want to create.
[15:31] I want to ask you a follow up question because I was actually taking it
[15:31] in a different direction.
[15:36] I thought you were referring to like.
[15:37] Questions related to specific proposals in the Dow.
[15:42] Like what was.
[15:44] I mean, they could be.
[15:46] I just want to feature a question as like the talking point for the day
[15:46] or something.
[15:50] Or for the week.
[15:51] Does that make sense?
[15:53] So like it could be like a question for proposal owners.
[15:56] And then it could be to try to raise like awareness for that project within
[15:56] the incubator, for example.
[16:05] Yeah, kind of community talking points.
[16:08] I even, you know, it's a really cool thought.
[16:10] I had this idea for imagine like a digital talking stick.
[16:14] Like write the code for a digital talking stick that you could kind of pass
[16:14] along and write.
[16:19] And, you know, you could you could write up.
[16:20] Make it.
[16:22] Like with a blockchain where people answer and then pass it on to somebody or.
[16:28] I thought that was like a cool, interesting concept.
[16:31] Was something that I would like to maybe pursue with the same page.
[16:34] Okay.
[16:37] But yeah.
[16:37] So, so that's like.
[16:39] That's idea number one question of the day.
[16:40] Yeah.
[16:41] Yeah.
[16:45] So just share reward.
[16:47] Maybe give like rewards to some of the best answers.
[16:51] The other.
[16:52] The other one was voting rewards and voting reputation.
[16:57] I would like maybe even to challenge the community.
[16:59] Like have a like pose this as a challenge for somebody to take on.
[17:03] Where, you know, you could, you know, do some sort of.
[17:07] Reward and incentive system for master note owners.
[17:12] I even had this thought of where every time you vote.
[17:16] You get or like depending on how much.
[17:19] Um, but yeah, like every time you vote, your name gets entered into like a
[17:19] lottery.
[17:24] And then we randomly select, um, voters or dash voters to receive dash back for,
[17:24] uh, for voting
[17:30] and making decisions.
[17:31] Um, so I think that's an interesting concept we could explore, um, instead of just
[17:31] making
[17:36] it like consistent, like you automatically get dash back.
[17:39] If you vote, like we can make it.
[17:41] So it's a little bit of like random.
[17:42] Um, we could even do like reward people that are the most engaged in the
[17:42] conversation.
[17:49] So like if they're commenting on a proposal, um, we could have like, um,
[17:55] even just like starting kind of like a, like a tipping culture within the community,
[18:01] but where like, we are like supportive of each other, people's ideas and projects.
[18:07] And like, um, kind of like our project managers, like everybody kind of takes on,
[18:07] uh, uh, a project
[18:15] management role in, in a sense, or as far as like their perspective or, um,
[18:15] what they want to share.
[18:20] Um, but yeah, so that was one of my ideas, um, like a, a raffle
[18:20] system.
[18:25] Um, then, um,
[18:31] the other one, so I said like the idea of like circularity or kind of
[18:31] like a tipping coordination
[18:37] culture, um, where we could even, um, I would love to do some sort of
[18:37] like program or if somebody
[18:43] wants to start this, like a, like an incubator for master node owners to like
[18:43] partner with projects.
[18:49] Um, I even had the thought of like, kind of like working units or working
[18:49] teams where like we could
[18:56] match community members to a master node, like representative or a master node owner,
[19:01] we could do like teams of like 10 or something, um, and then like make
[19:01] decisions, um, together.
[19:06] And I thought that could be, cause not everybody can afford a dash master node.
[19:10] And so I thought like having some type of like community like pods or like
[19:10] sessions where you
[19:16] get to talk to someone and like, you can vote and make decisions together.
[19:21] Um, I thought that was an interesting concept that we could explore.
[19:26] Um, yeah, so this, this bullet point just in case somebody's, uh, not watching,
[19:30] but listening instead says enable and encourage dash master node owners to contribute to
[19:36] and fund projects in addition to the dash treasury funding projects.
[19:40] So I know that, um, in the past, Joel has, has championed this idea of
[19:40] trying to get certain
[19:49] master node owners to contribute the first little seed funding, or at least, um, some
[19:49] kind of funding
[19:58] to show that an idea was worth more funding from the treasury. So you're saying,
[19:58] uh, additional funding,
[20:05] not necessarily, um, in like pro prior to putting up a proposal like Joel was
[20:05] doing.
[20:12] But, um, but yeah, I, I think that anytime that you can get somebody to
[20:12] give you their money from
[20:19] their personal pocket, that does show, uh, speaks more, more interest for sure. And it
[20:19] helps to get that
[20:27] master node owner engaged in the outcome of the project. So yeah, I can speak
[20:27] from personal
[20:35] spirit experience that I would personally like more feedback from master node owners. Um,
[20:41] because if there's one thing that's lacking, it is that, uh, text based feedback, we
[20:41] get feedback in
[20:50] terms of votes that, that comes in pretty well. Like I was saying earlier, like
[20:50] the voting feedback is,
[20:57] is really good in, in dash. We, there's almost always enough voting to, to get
[20:57] things either passed or
[21:05] not passed. And it's not really ever a problem that we don't have enough votes,
[21:05] but it is very
[21:12] rare that we get enough comments and feedback when there's not some, when, when the
[21:12] votes are negative,
[21:19] or even when the votes are positive, like, I don't know what I'm doing. Right.
[21:19] But I guess I'm doing
[21:23] something right. That kind of stuff. Um, so yeah, anything else you wanted to say
[21:23] about this, this item,
[21:29] number three, um, now, now that we've kind of read it in its entirety, I
[21:29] think, I think it, it does,
[21:37] like, I think we could even do something where like, maybe we could do like
[21:37] a program where you have to
[21:42] raise money from the community first, and then you could get access to the treasury
[21:42] or, or to do proposals
[21:48] from the treasury or like, I even, so one of my thoughts was something called
[21:48] a, a same page,
[21:54] like context receipt. And that could be like in the governance world, that could be
[21:54] like, uh, like a
[22:01] file or like a receipt that shows how many people are behind an idea or,
[22:01] you know, quote unquote, on the
[22:06] same page about something. So kind of like the, like a governance receipt. And that
[22:06] could be used as,
[22:13] um, that could be used to kind of prove and, you know, prove to investors
[22:13] and to kind of build trust.
[22:20] Um, and so I think that could be interesting. Um, so yeah, so kind of
[22:20] encouraging community members to
[22:27] support each other's projects and ideas, um, and kind of building like, uh, a culture
[22:27] of, of support and
[22:35] like a culture of coordination. Um, I, and then the next thought I would love
[22:35] to do is, is with the same
[22:41] pages, uh, like hackathons, like, uh, governance hackathons. Um, I'm kind of, I've been exploring
[22:41] this
[22:47] world of governance a little bit, and, um, I'd love to, um, connect with some
[22:47] community members, um, to share
[22:55] ideas and what's been working and, um, what we haven't tried yet. Um, and maybe
[22:55] doing, yeah, like challenges
[23:02] with those, um, we could start them from the, the question of the day to
[23:02] like the questions of the
[23:08] day could start as different things. They could turn into events. They could turn into,
[23:08] um, you know,
[23:14] they could turn into projects. Um, and then my other, this is my big kind
[23:14] of, oh yeah, sorry.
[23:22] Before we get to the big thing, let's, let's hang on, uh, governance hackathons for
[23:22] just a little bit.
[23:27] Uh, tell people what a hackathon is because some people might not be aware of
[23:27] the, of the term.
[23:31] And then what would be, what, what, what makes it, what makes a hackathon a
[23:31] governance hackathon?
[23:36] So I want to make like a, like a governance dApp store with the same
[23:36] page and allow people to build
[23:49] and have, and have like governance dApps, um, on, um, on the website. And something
[23:49] that I wanted to do is
[23:56] like kind of really like go into like the philosophy of governance and go into
[23:56] like research it together
[24:05] as a community, um, and kind of, um, brainstorm ideas to increase engagement, but make
[24:05] it in like
[24:13] a meaningful way. I think in, in my world of Solana, the big thing that
[24:13] they, and this is a big thing in
[24:19] every kind of blockchain and DAO is, um, and building a product is creating like
[24:19] an experience, creating
[24:25] something like meaningful or memorable. Um, and so that's kind of my thoughts for the
[24:25] governance hackathons
[24:34] is kind of pose, you know, challenges to the community. You know, how can we
[24:34] make more decisions
[24:40] together? How can we make like better decisions together? Um, how can we make more
[24:40] like effective
[24:45] decisions together? Um, and then, you know, what tools can we use, um, to do
[24:45] that? What tools can we,
[24:53] um, you know, what, what tools do we need? Um, what, what can we build,
[24:53] um, to, what can we build to help
[25:02] us, you know, get on the same page? Um, and, uh, I think though, I,
[25:02] I think, um, I haven't seen anybody do
[25:13] like a governance hackathon, but I thought it, it would, it's like a really unique
[25:13] kind of
[25:17] like focus kind of section. Um, because I think, again, I think that's at the
[25:17] root of what blockchain
[25:24] kind of is. It's like, it's shared ownership and it's, it's, um, it's, it's, it's
[25:24] community based,
[25:30] it's community driven. Um, and it's just like decision driven, you know, like, I think
[25:30] like networks are,
[25:37] um, are kind of, you know, they're run and managed by decisions, decisions that the
[25:37] community makes.
[25:45] Um, so I think any way, any way that we can, um, kind of inspire
[25:45] more people to think about this stuff,
[25:51] um, and, and, you know, solve some of these things, um, and to, you know,
[25:51] keep the conversation going.
[25:57] So that's my goal with, if, if we do these hackathons is just to keep
[25:57] the conversation going,
[26:01] um, you know, kind of building up momentum as we build just a little bit
[26:01] more from my perspective
[26:08] on the hackathon thing. Uh, just for anybody who doesn't know, or isn't aware, like
[26:08] the term is kind
[26:13] of a play on spin on the word marathon where, you know, in a marathon
[26:13] you're running for 26 miles.
[26:20] It's a long time. This is like, uh, yeah. So like, it's not like a
[26:20] sprint, it's more of a marathon.
[26:26] So these hackathons, sometimes they'll go for days or weeks or sometimes even months long.
[26:26] So you'll
[26:32] have, you'll have a specific category and you'll say like, build something related to governance.
[26:32] Um,
[26:38] and you have three weeks or the whole month to complete that. And then at
[26:38] the end of the month,
[26:45] you submit your, your code and your application. And then there are some judges that
[26:45] say,
[26:50] we think that this is number one, two, and three, and then that you get
[26:50] some bounties. So that's the,
[26:55] that's the general idea of a hackathon. It is something that I have wanted to
[26:55] do in the incubator
[27:02] itself for a while. I'm waiting on a good SDK. Uh, I have to give
[27:02] that plug because it's like
[27:09] the most important thing that we can have for, because when you're a developer, you
[27:09] need, uh,
[27:15] that's basically what a hackathon is usually, uh, oriented around is it's saying you can
[27:15] build
[27:23] whatever you want, but it has to have a significant portion of the application has
[27:23] to use this SDK,
[27:30] whether that's like, or, or this framework, uh, or this library. Um, and so, yeah,
[27:30] we definitely need
[27:37] some good tools for people to use. We have some, but yeah, there are some
[27:37] questions about like how,
[27:45] what's going to survive, like what SDKs are going to be, uh, continued to use.
[27:45] We have a rust SDK. Uh,
[27:54] I'm looking for a JavaScript SDK. So anyway, I just wanted to put in a
[27:54] little plug for that.
[27:59] I love the idea of governance as well. Uh, let's move on to your next
[27:59] point. Cause I know that you
[28:03] thought that that was the most important part. So let's, let's give that the time
[28:03] it needs.
[28:10] Um, so the Bain model and kind of idea that I've been working on, um,
[28:10] as of late is something called,
[28:17] uh, like a waves protocol. Um, and so what I want to do is create,
[28:17] um, something along the lines of like a,
[28:27] like when you launch something or share something as a community, and when you want
[28:27] to like, kind of tell
[28:33] your story as a community, you could build or like launch like a wave. Um,
[28:33] and these could
[28:38] be like funding rounds, like funding rounds for projects. You could launch a funding round
[28:38] as a
[28:43] wave. Um, but what I really wanted to do is like make it so that
[28:43] these are kind of collective community
[28:50] sprints like, like tasks that anybody can kind of contribute to and help out with.
[28:50] Um, and I wanted
[28:57] to kind of build this as like a building block for coordination. Um, and so
[28:57] you could have like teams
[29:03] and you could like create a wave with other people. Um, and you could have
[29:03] like a wave ID and then invite
[29:09] people to your wave. Um, but this could be like a building block for, um,
[29:09] uh, kind of for, um, for, uh,
[29:21] like focusing, like focusing and helping us focus on what we need to. Um, but
[29:21] really just to kind of
[29:27] bring a lot of like energy and how we build. Um, I think it's that
[29:27] that's one of the, my favorite
[29:33] sayings is that sometimes it's less like, uh, well, what's the saying? It's a culture
[29:33] eats strategy for
[29:40] breakfast or like they're saying how, um, you can it sometimes even it's even more
[29:40] important about how
[29:48] you build than what you build. And so that's my focus with waves. Um, and,
[29:48] and also with the same page
[29:54] is I want to really dial in on that, like how we build, um, in
[29:54] kind of a collective kind of communal
[30:01] way. Um, and so that's my goal with waves. Um, I have, let's see on
[30:01] the same page. I originally,
[30:10] so I wanted to launch like a token for waves and I was even thinking
[30:10] maybe we could build this on top
[30:16] of dash or if they're talking about doing like, um, uh, like Solana has, uh,
[30:16] uh, SPL tokens. Um,
[30:26] I was wondering if there was talks about like dash doing something like that. It
[30:26] could also,
[30:31] my other thinking for waves is that it could be like a reputation, um, kind
[30:31] of token. So people could
[30:38] send it like as a tipping currency, um, or they could like, um, uh, they
[30:38] could wrap like dash and waves.
[30:48] Um, but I'm, I don't want to just come to the dash community pitching like
[30:48] a new coin. Like I want to,
[30:52] uh, I want to build value. Um, and I, I, I want to focus on
[30:52] the dash protocol and building on top of
[31:00] that. And waves is my, um, idea for, I think how we could kind of
[31:00] compliment that. Um, well, while you're
[31:07] saying that we do, uh, I'm not sure if you're aware, but we do have,
[31:07] uh, tokens coming to dash
[31:15] platform very soon. Um, so we will be able to make tokens, both fungible and
[31:15] non-fungible. In other
[31:22] words, both, um, um, unique and, uh, like one of what, like where, where there's
[31:22] like one token
[31:33] or there's 1000 tokens that are all the same, non-fungible, fungible, just in case anybody
[31:33] needs
[31:39] know about that distinction. Um, that's coming to dash soon. So I would say, you
[31:39] know, we, we built
[31:46] that for a reason. So that would be, it'd be good to test that idea
[31:46] on, on dash. But I also wanted to
[31:53] know a little bit more before you move on to what, what's your, what's your
[31:53] experience, uh, with Solana,
[32:00] anything you want to say about that? Like, what are they doing? Right. What, what,
[32:00] what have you noticed
[32:06] there? What are they doing wrong? Um, what, yeah, it's like compare and contrast if
[32:06] you would.
[32:12] Okay. So one of my big, the, the two big things I want to kind
[32:12] of talk about a little bit of the
[32:21] differences. Solana is like this, it's really big. They've, they've gotten a lot of momentum
[32:21] and energy
[32:27] and a lot of development. And it's almost like too big. It's almost like overwhelmingly
[32:27] big where you
[32:33] kind of feel like lost in the masses. Um, and, um, I know like the
[32:33] best, the easiest and the best and
[32:40] the strongest solution to that is to develop your voice, you know, build, like develop
[32:40] your voice on
[32:46] different platforms, create content, build up a community. Um, and I, um, I really liked
[32:46] kind of like
[32:54] the, the close knit culture of the dash community. Um, a little bit more, I
[32:54] feel like we're a little
[33:00] bit more, it's kind of like smaller team kind of based. Um, but what I've
[33:00] learned from working with,
[33:06] um, and learning in the Solana community, um, is that it's very, um, it's very
[33:06] like value driven and
[33:14] they're very like kind of number driven and, and like K kind of KPI driven
[33:14] and in order to kind of
[33:21] keep funding some of those or, or yeah. Um, like the, and it can, they're,
[33:21] they're kind of,
[33:30] they're kind of like, um, what's the word? I, I think,
[33:40] I, I think, um, the big thing for me is just that it was, it
[33:40] wasn't as like, again,
[33:50] it's just, it's the close knit network of the dash community. Um, it didn't feel
[33:50] me kind of,
[33:56] yeah, it didn't feel homey. It's, it's like, like, how do I describe it? Um,
[34:06] um, it's the other big thing is, um, they're a little, a little on the
[34:06] like elitist side and I
[34:19] don't want to get bad rep for, for kind of saying that, but like, kind
[34:19] of, I don't think they're
[34:22] watching this channel. I mean like, and I, I really, one of my biggest values
[34:22] is like inclusion. Like,
[34:29] I think, I think we should give people chances. Like, I think we should help
[34:29] people like get started at,
[34:34] like at any level. Um, and there, and dash is more on that, like inclusive
[34:34] side and giving people
[34:40] chances. And Solana was like, had, you know, have these very high expectations and kind
[34:40] of standards.
[34:46] Yeah. Um,
[34:47] Where are all the people coming from? I, I, I just wonder where are all
[34:47] these user,
[34:53] are, are, do you think that there are really a lot of users there and
[34:53] where are they all coming from
[34:58] and why are they, why are they there? That's what I want to know. Um,
[34:58] because if we do have this
[35:05] opposite problem where dash feels at home, it's a good, inclusive, cozy environment. Um, we're
[35:05] all,
[35:13] you know, we can all fit under one roof kind of thing, but so that's,
[35:13] that's, that's, that has its
[35:18] pros, but it also has its cons. And then Solana is on the other side
[35:18] of the spectrum where it's a huge
[35:24] community and you feel lost and it's, uh, it's kind of a corporate KPI driven
[35:24] thing rather than like,
[35:33] people enjoy each other. Like what I think we could strike a balance where we
[35:33] can learn from what
[35:40] they're doing. And I was, I was going to say that our values, that would
[35:40] be the ideal, but I, I just
[35:47] have a balance of both of those. Sorry to cut you off. No, no. Yeah.
[35:47] Where, where are all the users
[35:52] coming from if they really are in fact users? Hmm. Um, a lot of it
[35:52] is they kind of have this like build
[36:00] culture, you know, um, and that's permissive throughout all the, you know, other networks, but
[36:00] it's very, um,
[36:07] um, I, I think they kind of rely a lot on like word of mouth
[36:07] and they're very about creating an
[36:16] experience rather than trying to like, I mean, I mean, they do this, but rather
[36:16] they're more about
[36:22] creating the experience of building products rather than like creating hype or trying to sell
[36:26] kind of something. Um, but I, um, I think. What products do they have that
[36:26] are exciting?
[36:33] They have a, they, I mean like super team, um, they have Lulo, which is
[36:33] like a crypto savings account.
[36:40] Um, Lulo. Uh, so there's, I mean, they have a lot of infrastructure and a
[36:40] lot of projects.
[36:47] And the other thing is that I'm. How are all these builders building? Do you
[36:47] know,
[36:53] do you have any insights about like, how are they attracting the builders? If the
[36:53] users are coming
[36:57] because the builders are building cool things, how are they getting the builders?
[37:01] Um, they're content driven. Like they, um, they're very like, it's a very kind of
[37:01] engaged network where
[37:15] um, people share their perspective and create content. Um, and I think that, um, I
[37:15] think,
[37:25] um, I, I think honestly, it's more of like a, a word of mouth kind
[37:25] of network. Like I think nobody
[37:35] wants to really be like the loudest blockchain. They want to be like the strongest
[37:35] blockchain,
[37:39] if that makes sense. Like they don't want to be the, like nobody wants to
[37:39] be like the, the degen
[37:44] kind of community or have that kind of leading the way. Um, but, um, yeah,
[37:44] it's, Solana's, Solana's really
[37:53] cool, but again, it's like, it's, it's, it's too big that it's, that it's overwhelming.
[37:53] And, um, I like the, the tight knit dynamics.
[38:03] Um, well, I'm not in the Solana community at all. I don't really, I don't
[38:03] really, uh, yeah, I haven't
[38:09] even researched it there very much. I just know it from my third party perspective
[38:09] and what I think
[38:16] they're doing, you correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what they're doing is
[38:16] they have a lot of,
[38:21] uh, VC funding to build, to fund the developers that build the cool things that
[38:21] get the users.
[38:28] And so it all starts with funding and that's, uh, you know, I, I always
[38:28] try to put this plug in because
[38:34] dash has that capability of funding projects. If we can get the good builders to
[38:34] get funding from dash.
[38:43] And so that's, that's what, that is one of my main purposes is to try
[38:43] to get good builders to, uh, you
[38:50] know, get them funded through the dash treasury. And so that kind of goes back
[38:50] to what we were talking about
[38:58] earlier of getting engagement with, with master node owners. Um, but yeah, do you have
[38:58] anything
[39:03] else to say about that? And if not, then we'll move on to the, to
[39:03] your next slide.
[39:07] Um, I'm going to move on. So I created, uh, so I'm still learning. I,
[39:07] um, I'm not, uh,
[39:15] I'm, I'm still learning how to code, but I was using AI in this app
[39:15] to create like this mockup website.
[39:22] Um, and so one of them was, um, so with waves, I also, so I
[39:22] have the domain waves.fund and I thought
[39:30] that could be like a, like a funding platform that maybe even dash could use
[39:30] for community, like a
[39:37] community driven projects. Um, where instead of like treasury funds, it could be like crowd
[39:37] funds. Um,
[39:43] you could have matching funds. Um, and so what I did just as a simple,
[39:43] so I could get some experience,
[39:49] I created like a, a website, um, that, um, is just like a, a placeholder
[39:49] kind of for, um,
[40:00] for, I created a dash address. Um, and then here, I'll show it on this.
[40:00] Oh, okay. Yeah. We're not
[40:05] seeing it. If, if that was your intention, you're not seeing it. Okay. Uh, not
[40:05] yet. Um, you probably
[40:11] shared your window instead of, yes, we see this. Yes. Okay. Do you see the
[40:11] dash enemy? Yeah. Yeah.
[40:18] Um, yeah. So I just wanted to make this as like a placeholder kind of
[40:18] as like a crowdfunding website too.
[40:24] So I have the waste fund that you can copy the address and I want
[40:24] to make it so that you can
[40:29] include information about like your wave or like your project. So like a wave owner
[40:29] or like a wave
[40:35] guide. Um, and then I, so I contributed five dash to this treasury. And what
[40:35] I want to do is allow the
[40:41] community to vote on how that's used. Um, so allow the community to vote, um,
[40:41] on which or a project that
[40:47] this gets allocated to. Um, and then I have like a funding wave. So like
[40:47] wave 0.1, I'm going to raise
[40:54] 10 dash. Um, and then I just made like, this is like a, an ad
[40:54] for like, uh, impact projects in the
[41:01] blockchain space. And then I made this as like a, a text channel for, uh,
[41:01] you can have, uh, set your
[41:08] username and you can comment. Um, you can put your dash address. Um, and then
[41:08] you can type a message in
[41:16] an AI that I built called alpha AI. Um, but this is just kind of
[41:16] me experimenting. Um, and then I have
[41:23] like a, a view count at the bottom. So it logs the views. Um, and
[41:23] what I want to do is have this,
[41:28] so it automatically updates. So showing what's in that address. Um, and then I want
[41:28] to make, uh, polls
[41:34] at the bottom that allow the community to vote on how it's used. So, um,
[41:34] yeah, so community kind of driven
[41:40] funding, um, do you like the, the animation in the background? Yeah. That's good. That's
[41:40] very,
[41:46] very lively. Yeah. Is it cool? I'm also, I'm seeing time spent and I'm seeing
[41:46] waves raised.
[41:53] Is that you're saying that I, uh, so I made this like interactive thing. And
[41:53] so I wanted to do it
[42:01] like about like, like views. Like if you visit the website, you could like your
[42:01] attention could
[42:06] contribute to it was kind of my thinking. Um, and so that's why there's no
[42:06] actual, like you don't,
[42:11] I haven't launched the token yet or anything. This is not real. So this is
[42:11] just, if you cover over this,
[42:16] it shows waves raised. And then I wanted to make it so that if you
[42:16] shared it, like it would save this
[42:22] in between sessions. So like it shows how many people have like raised attention around
[42:22] this
[42:28] kind of, it's kind of having like attention driven, um, um, yeah. Like how many
[42:28] people are behind
[42:36] something. Um, so yeah, this was just me kind of experimenting. Um, and then I
[42:36] made, uh, um,
[42:44] I made this, uh, called unit dash, like this game. And I'm still working on
[42:44] this. Um,
[42:51] but, uh, you can share like a message. The world. Oh, wait, can you still
[42:51] see my screen?
[42:58] Uh, we can still see the screen, but not what you're typing into.
[43:01] No, I mean, okay. Uh, here. So I made this, uh, unit dash game, but,
[43:01] but here's the thing,
[43:06] like, we don't even have to build like these huge makeup projects within dash, just
[43:06] anything that uses it.
[43:11] And that, um, does that make sense? Like that kind of build culture of like
[43:11] the building,
[43:17] like smaller projects and, um, ideas. Um, so yeah. So I made this, it's like
[43:17] a game I was talking to,
[43:26] uh, I think, is he still in here? Um, black mirror. Um, yeah. Yeah. Oh
[43:26] yeah. Yeah. I played this game.
[43:33] I saw it. You played it. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, yeah. So I want to add
[43:33] like a, uh, a leaderboard and maybe
[43:39] make like attach it to a faucet so that, um, like it rewards like the
[43:39] top, um, top players and the
[43:45] leaderboard. Um, we can even make it, I was even going to make it. So
[43:45] it shows like, um, I have like a,
[43:52] uh, a dash, uh, like add at the bottom. Um, but yeah, I was going
[43:52] to, I was going to expand upon
[43:58] this. Okay. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is the classic Flappy Bird game. Yeah.
[43:58] Flappy Bird.
[44:04] Dashified. And yeah, it's, it's fun. You just press the space bar and it bounces
[44:04] you up and then you,
[44:12] you, you grab these things. Um, so what I was thinking with this is, you
[44:12] know, it would be very
[44:17] cool to, um, to have some kind of, to put the, the leaderboard statistics onto
[44:17] platform so that it's
[44:26] persistent and multiplayer. So that's, that's one, you know, easy, easy kind of thing that,
[44:26] that, well, I say easy,
[44:36] but I mean like conceptually easy thing that would be, uh, add value to dash
[44:36] and dash platform in terms
[44:42] of testing and then, uh, getting people to, to use it. Um, so yeah, I,
[44:42] I like the idea. I like the idea
[44:50] in general of like, just building lots of little things and seeing what sticks. So
[44:50] yeah, I like the
[44:58] direction that you're going here. Thank you. Um, so yeah, just to recap. So then,
[44:58] um, this is our main
[45:05] website for the same page. Um, it's kind of a temporary, uh, website. Um, it's,
[45:05] uh, kind of
[45:12] informational. Um, but what I wanted to do was also make it so that you
[45:12] could apply for grants and I want
[45:18] to do like grants, um, where they could be like sponsored by individual builders or,
[45:18] or sponsored by,
[45:25] I call it a sponsor. Um, so this is, um, this is what we've been
[45:25] working on. I came up with idea for
[45:35] a kind of like a, a name for our community and team called like the
[45:35] same team. But I also, um, I want to,
[45:44] um, like in the cyber security kind of infosec space, what I want to do
[45:44] is like kind of get
[45:53] the dashed Dow like more responsible and also like safer, more secure. And like, I,
[45:53] I think this could
[46:00] be like a organizing unit that could help with like some of the, um, like
[46:00] tasks, like, like verifying or
[46:10] reviewing things kind of. So I'm, I'm still like coming up with this idea, but
[46:10] I, I just called it the same
[46:16] team. Um, and, um, um, I kind of go into detail about, uh, how the,
[46:16] how these dynamics could work.
[46:27] So you create a page, um, and then if the community approves it, the page
[46:27] shows up on our website,
[46:32] um, and you get access to funding. Um, you can apply for a wave. Um,
[46:32] you can create a new page
[46:39] on the pages tab, uh, create your history, create, write your page in the history
[46:39] book
[46:44] of the decentralized web. Um, and yeah, our main thing is just matchmaking. So matchmaking
[46:44] project
[46:52] owners and founders, uh, with sponsors and investors. Um, I, uh, this was just like
[46:52] an example of like a
[47:01] profile. So you have your page idea, you have your pages that you've written, um,
[47:01] what you've worked on.
[47:06] Um, I also, I, what I want to do with the pages protocol is kind
[47:06] of make it like, again, what do
[47:13] we need to get on the same page about, um, and kind of make it
[47:13] so that it's a, like, you can go onto our
[47:19] website, create a new page. And then I want to track like engagement around that
[47:19] as well. Um, so maybe even
[47:25] give, um, like attention rewards, um, and integrate that with dash. Um, so that's kind
[47:25] of my thinking. Um,
[47:35] so yeah, so this is the same page I'm looking for right now. I'm looking
[47:35] for a co-founder to build it with. Um,
[47:41] and I'm looking to build a team for it. Um,
[47:43] and I was, uh,
[47:47] wanted to start it up within the dash community, um, to kind of build up
[47:47] a team or build a wave within the dash community,
[47:54] um, to do kind of collective community projects. So ideas built together. Um, and then
[47:54] these are some of our values,
[48:02] views, transparency, learner's mindset, decentralization. Um,
[48:08] and then we just have a store. I have gear or, uh, like I made
[48:08] sweatshirts and stuff.
[48:15] Um, but I know, but we're just getting started, but this is, uh, um, just
[48:15] an example.
[48:23] Um, so yeah, this is what I've been up to on the, on the team
[48:23] page on the team section. Uh, I noticed
[48:29] like three people are, are those real people or do you actually, um, so far,
[48:29] or is it just you?
[48:35] Oh, those, those were guys in the, in the beginning that I was working with.
[48:35] Um, they're not active or
[48:40] involved anymore. Okay. So that's why you're looking for another co-founder. Yes. That's, I'm looking
[48:40] for a
[48:45] co-founder. Um, so yeah, I'm, uh, and I know it, it, it might not happen
[48:45] overnight. So I'm looking to
[48:53] kind of establish, reestablish myself, uh, within the dash community, um, help improve engagement,
[48:59] meet, meet some people, meet some new builders that are, um, that have joined. Um,
[48:59] and I also,
[49:04] I want to see if I can help with the incubator. Um, and, uh, maybe
[49:04] I could be one of the community kind of
[49:12] project managers for the incubator or help with projects like answer questions for people.
[49:17] Um, yeah, I'll, I'll talk with you after the show a little bit more about
[49:17] that in general. Um,
[49:24] my, my approach with the incubator right now is that I want to help folks
[49:24] like you get started,
[49:32] but also to get on your own two feet and have your own independent proposal
[49:32] as soon as possible. So that's,
[49:41] that's my goal is to, to be an incubator, but also a little bit less,
[49:41] uh, uh, like shorter term.
[49:49] So in the past we've worked with certain, we've worked with some developers for years.
[49:49] Um, and so,
[49:56] and that has worked, but more moving forward, I want to try to get people
[49:56] on their own two legs,
[50:05] independent and also so that master node owners can, uh, to, can judge, uh, and
[50:05] fund or not fund
[50:14] those developers with more granularity, um, rather than kind of like being in the incubator
[50:14] too long.
[50:24] So that's, that's what I'll say, uh, right now about that, just because I think
[50:24] it is relevant to other
[50:29] people. And so anybody watching can know that, uh, I think that is, that is
[50:29] a good point. It's like,
[50:34] you're not, um, it's at the end of the day, you know, the, the goal
[50:34] and the purpose is to build,
[50:40] you know, build ideas. And so like, I, I like that as like less time
[50:40] spent in there and more on, um,
[50:48] you know, uh, right. Like that's kind of the goal. Um, yeah. To, to get,
[50:48] to get you on your own as
[50:53] soon as possible. Uh, and I think that's the, that's the best for everybody involved,
[50:53] both the incubator
[50:58] and the MNOs and the independent projects, uh, because the sooner you can get that
[50:58] direct feedback,
[51:04] um, and, uh, like responsibility, the better. So, so yeah, but people do need a
[51:04] place to land, uh,
[51:13] in dash. And so that's what the incubator, that's what I'm trying to do is,
[51:13] is give people
[51:18] a platform and a place to kind of throw around ideas, talk with, talk with
[51:18] me about what the
[51:24] community, what I think the community would value, what it might not, what's worked, what
[51:24] hasn't worked.
[51:30] So I'll talk with you more about that, uh, after the show, but anything else
[51:30] that you wanted to share,
[51:35] we've gone for 50 minutes now. Uh, what else do you want to say as
[51:35] your, as your parting message,
[51:41] to the dash community? Um, just that I'm really looking forward to come back with
[51:41] a lot of energy,
[51:50] um, and kind of a new and kind of evolved and more mature mindset. Um,
[51:50] and, uh, I hope that, um,
[51:59] you guys give me another chance to kind of, uh, build up trust. Um, and,
[51:59] um, I know like before I
[52:07] have, I have a lot of ideas, um, but I'm looking to, um, you know,
[52:07] take action and implement and kind
[52:14] of be, um, you know, be an integrator. Um, so that's my goal. Um, and
[52:14] so I appreciate, uh, your support.
[52:21] I also appreciate all of your feedback. If any of you guys have ideas or
[52:21] comments on some of the ideas
[52:25] we've shared. Um, and if you're interested in either partnering or, uh, contributing, um, or
[52:25] wanting to be
[52:32] a partner with me, um, my, uh, you can just message me in the dash,
[52:32] uh, discord, um, or on Twitter. Um,
[52:40] and yeah, I appreciate you guys, um, be willing to work with me again. Um,
[52:40] I, I really, I, I like this
[52:47] community. This is like, I, I, I like kind of what we stand for and
[52:47] I, I like our mindset. Um,
[52:55] and I, I, I think what we need to do is kind of step up
[52:55] together, like as a network, um, and get more
[53:03] people engaged and participating. Um, and I, I want to inspire, I want to inspire
[53:03] people to build on dash.
[53:10] Um, and I, I think that that should kind of, um, um, that could be
[53:10] kind of what we, what we do as a
[53:19] community is like kind of focus on that empowerment aspect. Cause that, that's my biggest
[53:19] thing that I
[53:24] kind of got from, uh, working with you guys in, in my experience with all,
[53:24] with the dash community,
[53:29] um, is, is the energy. Um, and, uh, um, yeah, I'll, I'll be available in
[53:29] the discord. If you guys
[53:38] want to message me, um, my email is also just, uh, same page visions at
[53:38] gmail.com. Um, so if you're
[53:46] interested in being a partner with me, um, I'm also looking for, uh, some developers
[53:46] to help me build our
[53:52] website, um, for the, uh, in our, our, our protocol for waves. Um, so yeah,
[53:52] uh, thank you guys for your
[53:59] time and, uh, thanks, thanks for listening. Yeah. And thank you for, you know, you've,
[53:59] you've done a
[54:05] lot of work on your own. Uh, and I just wanted you to know that
[54:05] that, that kind of shows like a lot of
[54:10] people haven't done this much work when they approach me in the incubator. So thanks
[54:10] for doing all that
[54:18] you've done so far and I look forward to working with you in the future.
[54:18] So everybody,
[54:22] thanks for tuning in and we'll see you next week. Oh yeah. Thank you guys.
[54:22] See ya.
