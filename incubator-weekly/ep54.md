[00:00] (upbeat music) When we look at interest rates at the most popular banks
[00:11] for the majority of Americans where they're gonna be keeping their cash,
[00:15] they are not making anything on their savings despite the fact that interest rates
[00:21] from the Federal Reserve have been jacked up to decade highs.
[00:26] This right here is a chart of the federal funds rate and this is the amount that the Federal Reserve
[00:32] is paying to banks on their reserves. So while they're getting a risk-free 4 1/2
[00:38] to 4 3/4% on your money, they're passing through a whopping 0.01% of that.
[00:46] And so a lot of people don't realize how severe these are gonna get.
[00:54] And the scary part is these declines are so big and they catch a lot of people off guard
[00:59] that there's reports done just between 2008 and 2009, there was over 6,500 suicides
[01:07] directly related to falling equity prices. So what we're going into,
[01:12] what a lot of people don't understand is how severe things could get.
[01:15] - The world has changed so much in the last three years that I just find it absolutely unbelievable
[01:24] and I didn't believe evil at this scale existed and it does.
[01:31] There's a lot of distraction going on. What I would urge people to do,
[01:37] I don't pay attention to all of it all the time. And what I do is I try to focus
[01:44] on understanding the system behind it. Right now, they inflate the currency supply
[01:51] and they transfer wealth. But if they scare people too much,
[01:55] you can go into other assets. Well, once they've got central bank digital currency,
[02:00] if they don't want you to buy gold, they just won't allow you.
[02:03] The currency won't buy it. The currency is programmable.
[02:06] They can control almost every aspect of your life once we get on any programmable currency
[02:14] where they can, if they don't like you, they can make it so that you can't spend any currency
[02:19] within a five-mile, you know, outside of a five-mile radius of your home.
[02:23] If they don't want you to travel, you won't be able to buy airline tickets
[02:26] or take an Uber or pay for a hotel room. Well, the markets are getting hammered.
[02:34] And of course, we know from the Fed minutes the other day that there's a lot more hawks in the Fed
[02:40] than there is doves. And that rates are not gonna stop going up.
[02:44] And, you know, this is kind of a game that they're playing. And I think this is leading into the digital currency world.
[02:50] But inflation is not under control. We don't, and we don't have people working.
[02:54] We're more in danger of stagflation right now, which would be obviously the worst.
[02:59] High prices and nobody working. Because the jobs numbers, which we'll see next Friday,
[03:04] are gonna be garbage as well because the jobs that we're seeing
[03:08] are part-time employment, not full-time employment. So you have a hot inflation number,
[03:13] which is still under, well understated. And I can tell you that I don't go grocery shopping a lot.
[03:19] But when I'm in Vegas myself, which I have been, my bill is 40% higher over the last six months.
[03:25] So you can do that. And that's buying the same exact products.
[03:28] - They caused this inflation. They need to deal with this problem that they caused.
[03:38] I do not think that the mistake is tightening. I think the mistake was doing the stuff beforehand
[03:44] that made the tightening necessary. And I think the bigger mistake will be
[03:47] once they do beat inflation, how they will respond to that. Because the way they're gonna beat inflation
[03:53] is by causing a deep recession. In any case, once we see the data getting to the point
[03:58] where they believe it, it's already too late. The recession is already baked in.
[04:03] The hard landing is already almost a certainty. - If you really wanna help out this country
[04:13] and remove the barriers between the very rich who just own things and people working at Walmart
[04:20] and at McDonald's who have suffered for two years almost of negative real wages
[04:26] and don't own houses, multiple houses, and don't have a stock account,
[04:30] you wanna close that gap, which is the right thing to do. Okay, you want people to earn a living
[04:35] based on their productivity and their ingenuity, not because they inherited money
[04:39] or because they got a loan from the bank or the condition of how they were born.
[04:43] Jerome Powell, if he was really and truly gonna fight inflation,
[04:47] come out and say, you know what? I'm going to raise interest rates.
[04:50] But I'm also gonna drain all of this excess gambling liquidity from Wall Street.
[04:55] (upbeat music) - Hello, and welcome to Incubator Weekly.
[05:07] As you can see, we have an absolutely packed house relative to what we are used to.
[05:12] You have your usual co-host today, Rion. Hello, Rion.
[05:17] - Howdy. - And myself, Amanda.
[05:19] And today we are joined by not one but two project leads. We firstly have with us the project lead
[05:27] for the Maya Protocol, Alux. Good morning, I guess, Alux.
[05:32] - Hi guys, good morning. - Wonderful.
[05:35] And secondly, we have Dash Incubator strategist and lead of the Dash integration
[05:41] into the Maya Protocol, Ash Francis. Good evening, Ash.
[05:45] - Yeah, it's actually morning. I live in Vancouver, but good morning, Amanda.
[05:48] (all laughing) - It's more morning there than here.
[05:51] - Yeah, it's pretty early, 9 a.m. - Scrap the whole show, let's start over again.
[05:56] Well, in any case, glad to have everybody here. So let us start off with an overview from you, Alux,
[06:06] as to why, basically, what is Maya, why is Maya? - All right, so Maya is essentially
[06:18] a cross-chain exchange facilitator that doesn't rely on trusted centralized parties.
[06:25] It's run, essentially, by validator nodes running the Maya node code
[06:32] that have an incentive to secure the chain because they're posting bonds that are higher
[06:42] than the assets they're securing. This allows you to do swaps.
[06:48] So imagine a Nuni swap, but instead of being Ethereum-based
[06:51] and just for Ethereum tokens, this is much broader,
[06:55] and you could be swapping from Bitcoin to ETH to, say, Atom and to Dash,
[07:02] and that's why we're here today. Pretty cool stuff.
[07:05] We're based off of ThorChain's code base. So ThorChain is an amazing project
[07:10] that's been doing this for two years already, and we are essentially the first fork,
[07:16] and we have a friendly relationship with them. We've been working on this already for a long while,
[07:23] and we're looking forward to launch now in March. So they will find out more about what we're doing
[07:30] and to have Dash integrated first things after launch. So we've been working on this for a while.
[07:36] I think Ash can give us an update on that. But yeah, we believe we're doing this
[07:44] because we just noticed that centralized parties are not to be trusted in crypto.
[07:49] We've seen this with FTX and many other occurrences over time,
[07:53] and I hope this time we learned our lesson and start looking at which decentralized alternatives
[07:59] are there, like Maya and ThorChain, to not fall into this trap again.
[08:04] And from the videos we were shown, we need to do this now.
[08:09] The longer we wait, the more fragile crypto is for government regulation and capture.
[08:15] So there is some urgency to getting these out the door. And yeah, happy to be here.
[08:21] Thank you for inviting us to join. - Thanks, Alux.
[08:25] So as you mentioned, Maya is a decentralized exchange, something that Dash has been interested to be in,
[08:37] have under its belt for some time now. And so this is where Ash comes into play,
[08:43] because, correct me if I'm wrong, the incubator had written a fair bit of code
[08:48] to integrate Dash into the project that Alux forked from, which, as he mentioned, is ThorChain.
[08:56] And so we had some code, lots of code ready for that. How much of that was able to translate, Ash?
[09:03] - Yeah, ultimately we started work on ThorChain in June, 2021.
[09:10] So a fairly long time ago, ThorChain was in a very sort of early stage as well.
[09:17] They were working on establishing processes, adding new chains, but as proactive as Dash is,
[09:22] we were in there first. We were the first project to really start building out
[09:26] and complete our own chain client for ThorChain. Otherwise, prior to that, all the other coins,
[09:32] their chain clients had been developed by ThorChain internal dev house at Nine Realms
[09:38] who work very closely with ThorChain and operate nodes. So we carried on.
[09:43] We built this whole chain client for ThorChain, and we actually reached a completed chain client
[09:48] pretty quickly, relatively speaking. But unfortunately, the project's immaturity
[09:55] kind of caught up to it, and it started building out policies and protocols
[09:59] for how it wants to add new coins. And that meant a much longer process of moving goalposts.
[10:05] I don't harbor any sort of ill will to ThorChain because that's the nature of projects in this space.
[10:10] They move fastly, we iterate, and we learn. And it is essential for security
[10:16] and for the good health of their project that they respond to their DAO effectively.
[10:22] They have a DAO of their node operators, and those node operators have to choose
[10:27] whether they want to add Dash. Like, we run our own governance questions to our network.
[10:32] So yeah, we completed the whole integration into ThorChain, and that was kind of sitting idle for a while.
[10:39] And since then, things have erupted. We have the first fork, obviously, with Maya.
[10:45] There's another fork happening called Black, which is by the actual Nine Realms team themselves,
[10:49] which is heavily privacy-focused. But Maya is an ideal place for us.
[10:55] And one thing I'd like to touch on is that video at the start.
[10:57] It does show the value that Maya brings to this, the decentralized nature of exchange,
[11:04] the lack of those third-party controls. I can't wait for it.
[11:08] I'm so excited. And we've completed the Dash integration.
[11:12] We have successful trades happening. We're ready to go.
[11:16] Maya is launching. Like, everything is on full acceleration now.
[11:20] - Thank you. So before we get much more into why Maya and Dash,
[11:28] rather, how it is that they can particularly benefit one another,
[11:34] I, if I may, wanted to back up just a little bit and just establish a few foundational elements of Maya,
[11:41] which is, okay, so obviously, we're talking about a blockchain-based
[11:47] decentralized exchange here, yes? - Yeah.
[11:52] - And the other day, when Alux and I were speaking a bit about this call,
[11:57] I said, "So establish for me, Alux, now, what proof of whatever is Maya again?
[12:03] Is it proof of stake, proof of work?" And he said something like, "It's none of those things."
[12:07] And that's when I started to sweat and hoped that we could get a little bit of clarification
[12:12] on such things today. Would you tell us just a few of the technical basics
[12:17] of how the chain works, Alux? - Sure.
[12:19] So it's kind of similar to a proof of stake chain, but I would call it more,
[12:27] or prefer to call it a proof of bond, and let me explain why.
[12:30] So fortunately, the Maya code is based on Tendermint. Tendermint is the underlying, Tendermint BFT,
[12:36] which is the underlying consensus mechanism for all Cosmos-based chains.
[12:41] So Cosmos, Juno, in its time, Terra, all of them run these Tendermint consensus,
[12:48] which is a Byzantine-fold-tolerant consensus that requires 67% consensus to operate.
[12:54] The nice thing, or why it's great to do it on Tendermint, if you're talking about a decentralized exchange,
[13:01] is that it has instant confirmation. And Dash knows a bit about this instant confirmation power,
[13:08] because if you're talking about a chain that will be helping you swap from Bitcoin to ETH,
[13:13] for instance, Bitcoin has block confirmations, ETH has block confirmations,
[13:19] and then having also the middle man between them, the fortune of Maya B, also having block confirmations,
[13:26] would be very, very difficult to pin down and allows things like front-running,
[13:31] which we don't want, and other stuff. So having Tendermint is a sound decision in this regard,
[13:38] and it also comes with all the Cosmos SDK tools to more easily develop all of these tools.
[13:44] So it's an application-specific blockchain, essentially. Now, the reason why it's proof-of-bond
[13:50] while you see other Cosmos chains be proof-of-stake is that typically in a proof-of-stake governance,
[13:57] the person or the node with most stake has more voting power.
[14:02] And this is not true on Fortune or Maya. Every node has one voting power,
[14:07] regardless of how big or small their bond is. Now, the interesting thing is,
[14:13] bonds are typically very homogeneous because the protocol is constantly churning out
[14:20] the lowest bonds and allowing the largest bonds to churn in every seven days or so.
[14:26] So this tends to make nodes have more or less the same bond, and that would happen as well on Maya.
[14:31] So that's why we call it proof-of-bond. You're essentially having a Senate of several nodes
[14:39] that are securing the chain, having these huge bonds that is their own,
[14:44] and if they misbehave, their own bonds will be slashed to make the network whole again.
[14:52] So that's why it's kind of in the branch of proof-of-stake, but just a bit different, which makes sense.
[15:01] It just makes sense for these blockchain in the sense of how it works.
[15:05] - So I guess I can immediately see some of the initial reason why the Dash team
[15:12] and the Maya team were attracted to each other at first, which is, Rion, am I correct in saying
[15:18] that the currently in development Dash platform also utilizes the Tendermint blockchain setup?
[15:26] So we're kind of like working on the same ethos in a way here?
[15:29] - Yeah, I was actually gonna point that out and maybe ask a follow-up question about that
[15:33] because we have done the same thing. We have a fork of Tendermint.
[15:38] We call it TenderDash. I think nobody's in love with that name,
[15:41] but it was just a temporary thing. If anything, it probably should be Dashmint,
[15:47] like your, anyway, but-- - Love Dashmint, by the way.
[15:50] - But yeah, the fact that Maya is using equal weights for their voting does sound a little bit similar
[16:02] to how we do it, because for the validators of a Tendermint fork, it's usually,
[16:10] as far as I understood, it's usually that, like you said, Alux, that those different validators
[16:17] have different weights for their voting. But with Dash, we have masternodes,
[16:23] which all have exactly 1,000 Dash, and so they have exactly the same stake,
[16:28] and we kind of need that. So I wonder if there's maybe even a potential
[16:36] where instead of using, well, you've got your customized solution,
[16:42] but at some point, we're going to kind of generalize the TenderDash mechanism to be applicable
[16:51] for other chains to use. So I wonder if that might be a potential thing
[16:57] to look into for Maya. But yeah, that's a great project.
[17:02] Cosmos has done enormous things for this cryptocurrency space,
[17:07] and I just wanted to point out one other thing that I was thinking about when Alux was talking
[17:12] or somebody was talking. It's kind of interesting, there's a lot of parallels
[17:17] between Maya and Dash right now, because ThorChain was kind of the leading
[17:22] crypto exchange DEX, and that's kind of like Bitcoin in a sense, that it was leading cryptocurrency.
[17:29] And then Dash came along, and we had some innovations and some things that we wanted to change,
[17:35] and so we forked from Bitcoin. So Dash is to Bitcoin like Maya is to ThorChain
[17:40] in a lot of ways. And I expect to see some of that innovation
[17:44] where maybe you have some things that you want to change, and I think you have changed a lot of things,
[17:50] and we should probably get to some of those differences between ThorChain and Maya at some point.
[17:54] But yeah, I think it's great to have these alternatives because where would we be if we only had Bitcoin,
[18:01] and that was the whole of cryptocurrency? Well, we wouldn't have Dash for sure.
[18:06] - Pretty sure I'd still be trying to figure out how to use a lightning payment solution
[18:13] without relying on some kind of risky party in the middle. So I was thinking, do you think it would be helpful, Alux,
[18:22] if we were, because somebody can try out what Maya is going to feel like in a way right now, right?
[18:33] And almost even, as you had said, prepare themselves if they want to participate in your upcoming token auction
[18:41] by going through the current ThorChain wallet app, which is compatible with everything you're doing right now?
[18:49] - Yeah, so ThorChain ecosystem is a bit confusing because many, many brands have the Thor name on it.
[18:57] So one thing is ThorChain, and that's the protocol and kind of the chain.
[19:01] Then we have ThorSwap, which is one of the leading user interfaces on ThorChain,
[19:05] and then we have ThorWallet, which were the first to have a mobile app
[19:10] for this ecosystem, and now also have a web application. So on the case of ThorWallet,
[19:17] we've done a very close collaboration with them and have been working with them for months now
[19:22] on integrating Maya into their system. So they're kind of like our go-to launch partner
[19:29] at this point where we've tested most things and we have everything much better pinned down.
[19:35] So if you want to participate in Maya's liquidity auction, which we could talk more about in a second,
[19:41] which is the way we essentially distribute all of the cacao out to all the liquidity providers,
[19:49] you can test that on ThorWallet first. So go get familiar with ThorChain, ThorWallet.
[19:59] You can go to app.thorwallet.org today and create your wallet there, do some swaps.
[20:05] You won't see Dash there because Dash is not on ThorChain, but very soon you'll see also Maya there
[20:13] and within Maya Dash, and you'll just be using that same interface.
[20:16] So you're going to get a hang of things and kind of just prepare yourself.
[20:22] Practically and theoretically, you can just do more research on ThorChain itself
[20:26] and you'll be much better set up, better prepared for Dash upcoming launch on Maya.
[20:31] - Okay, so for anybody who may like to get familiar with this interface,
[20:37] both to be prepared for Maya's liquidity auction, which we'll talk more about in a few minutes here,
[20:44] as well as to integrate or interact rather fully with Maya once it's launched and Dash is available,
[20:51] we do have this fancy pants video here that your team made, Alux.
[20:56] Shall we show it to kind of give a visual of what we're talking about here?
[21:00] - Yeah. - Okay, let's show it.
[21:03] (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues)
[21:09] (upbeat music continues) (upbeat music continues)
[21:16] (upbeat music continues) (upbeat music continues)
[21:41] (upbeat music continues) (upbeat music continues)
[21:52] (upbeat music continues) - Well, I think that cleared a few things up.
[22:13] (Alux laughs) So, let us talk then about this issue of adding liquidity.
[22:19] Ash, will you tell us, will you give us just a general overview of,
[22:26] okay, if I'm a person who holds Dash and I'm not necessarily looking to swap,
[22:32] but rather I want to be a liquidity provider on Maya, what does that generally mean
[22:40] and how would I generally go about that? - I appreciate the question,
[22:44] but I think this time I'm going to give this to Alux on this one.
[22:48] I feel like he's got a better grasp on the economic side of it than I necessarily do.
[22:52] And he can talk about impermanent loss. And I think you guys are launching
[22:55] with impermanent loss insurance, even though Thorchain are dropping
[22:59] impermanent loss insurance soon. And I wonder if you're following suit,
[23:03] if you could answer that as well. - Yeah, sure.
[23:06] - Well, I'm glad you brought that one up because Dash is a big one too, Ash.
[23:11] So yes, please, both of those, Alux. - Okay, well, there's two options
[23:17] for people who want to add Dash to Maya for earning. Option number one is kind of the simplest.
[23:25] If you're not very savvy on crypto for a long time and you haven't had any experience
[23:30] doing any liquidity providing elsewhere, which is Dash Savers.
[23:34] And Dash Savers is just adding Dash and getting in-kind yield.
[23:38] Now that in-kind yield is variable and it's variable because it depends
[23:42] on the fees generated by the pool. So if there's no swapping going on in the Dash Kakao pool,
[23:49] there's no yield to give out. So it's real yield, it's coming from exchange
[23:53] and it coming from real utility, which makes it scalable. But then on Dash, you just get,
[23:59] you have your Dash there on the Savers, you're getting Dash in-kind yield,
[24:02] and then you can withdraw. Just importantly, going in and out of Dash Savers
[24:09] incurs slippage. So just make sure you are expecting
[24:13] to have your position probably around two to three months at least.
[24:17] Because if you're just going in and out very quickly, you're probably going to be at a small loss
[24:23] from that slippage. So do keep that in mind.
[24:27] But that's the best option if you're kind of a starter in all of these earning yield on DeFi stuff.
[24:35] Now, if you like a better return and you have more experience LPing on Uniswap
[24:42] or Torch in itself, what you can do is do dual LP, which is you get Dash and you get Kakao
[24:50] and you put both into the pool. This way you'll get also variable yield,
[24:55] but it's generally much higher than Dash Savers. The problem being that you incur impermanent loss.
[25:02] Impermanent loss happens when one asset increases or decreases in price respective to another.
[25:10] And that loss is triggered by arbitrage. You know, arbitrage is when they bring back
[25:18] the pool to equilibrium with the new market price. There's some profit to be made.
[25:25] That profit is made by the arbitrage bot or whoever is running that arbitrage.
[25:30] And the profit had to come from somewhere. It comes from the LPs.
[25:34] So there's always like this constant battle being fought in a liquidity pool where you have impermanent loss
[25:39] taking down your position and the yield generated by the swaps increasing your position.
[25:45] And as long as the yield is higher than impermanent loss, we're fine.
[25:49] But in very large price movements, it can happen that impermanent loss outruns yield,
[25:56] which is why dual LPs is more risky, but gives you a better return as well when it works out.
[26:01] Now, importantly, this impermanent loss, which is a weird name, but it's just essentially
[26:08] loss giving to arbitrage. The thing with it is that it obviously detracts
[26:17] a lot of people from LP. So there's a way that you can socialize that loss
[26:22] to the protocol because the protocol is interested in having a lot of dual LPs.
[26:26] And some pools are doing better than others. So when you socialize the loss of one pool to the rest,
[26:33] you're essentially just motivating more liquidity. Now, the thing is how Fortune used to do it
[26:40] is that impermanent loss ramps up from zero to 100% over 100 days at 1% per day.
[26:46] What that means is on day 30 of your LP position, if you withdraw and you have any permanent loss,
[26:53] the protocol will pay you 30% of that loss back on day 30. And after day 100 and onwards,
[27:00] it will always pay you 100% of that loss. Now, Fortune had that program.
[27:05] They retired it now that they have savers, but LPing is much more important on Maya
[27:10] because LPing is also the way nodes fund their assets. So because of that, we needed ILP back,
[27:18] but in a more sustainable way. Because the problem also on Fortune is you had a lot
[27:22] of short-term LPs that just wanted to come in for the quick buck, right?
[27:27] And as soon as there was some impermanent loss to get back, they would just withdraw.
[27:33] So the question that we posed to ourselves is, how can we do this better?
[27:39] Where you're incentivizing the right kind of long-term LP, where you're not having too much strain on the reserve,
[27:46] and that it still has the net positive of having people have confidence doing dual LP.
[27:53] So we did two things for this. Number one, impermanent loss protection starts
[27:59] until day 50, not on day zero. So you have 0% impermanent loss protection
[28:05] from your LP during the first 50 days, which is kind of already a long-term commitment.
[28:10] For a month and a half, I'm not protected at all. And if I want to have full protection,
[28:14] then it's from day 50 to 150, which is already kind of almost six months.
[28:20] So we believe that's kind of the right way to go. Now, importantly, from day 50 to day 150,
[28:30] you're getting permanent loss protection for Cacao underperforming your asset.
[28:34] Essentially what we're saying is, we're gonna protect you in 150 days
[28:38] from you being worse off because of Maya and because of kind of having a lower token price.
[28:44] But we would protect you from day 50 to day 450 at 0.25% per day
[28:52] for Cacao overperforming your asset. So essentially the logic there is,
[28:57] you're already better off thanks to Cacao being a strong asset.
[29:00] On day 100 or something, we're not gonna pay you impermanent loss protection on top of that.
[29:08] But if you're staying for one and a half years, then you're a very, very committed person.
[29:15] You might, you're needing that fund for something else. We gladly pay you back for that loss.
[29:23] Such that somebody looking to really hold Cacao with an asset for a very long time in a LP position,
[29:31] it has a confidence that the fact that they're contributing to the liquidity of the protocol
[29:37] for the long-term and the success of the protocol for the long-term,
[29:40] they'll also enjoy fully the benefits of the Cacao side in the long-term as well.
[29:46] So it also makes it such that it's very, it's very tough to withdraw.
[29:52] It's a very large decision to choose to withdraw since whatever you withdraw now loses
[29:57] and starts a counter again. So that's more or less the logic on it.
[30:02] It makes our program be between 25 and 30% cheaper than Thorchain's IOP program,
[30:07] which was also relatively cheap. So in general, we think it's the right direction.
[30:14] We have no plans of taking that off the table, at least for the time being.
[30:21] It can change in the future, I don't know. Governance at the end will slowly also be passed on
[30:26] to nodes and they can decide to grandfather it. But in the meantime, in our vision,
[30:31] at least from the core team, is to have it on, especially since nodes LP their bond.
[30:38] So, yeah. - So is this then,
[30:43] is this where the liquidity auction comes in? Do I, if I want to stake Dash,
[30:48] must I own like a one-to-one ratio of Cacao as well? Is that the purpose of Cacao or why would I buy Cacao?
[30:57] - Okay, so liquidity auction is how we launch. And that's one thing we can discuss it in a second.
[31:03] What you're mentioning now is LP and dual LP, which is, yeah, you have Dash and Cacao one-for-one
[31:09] in some metric of value. Say you choose dollar as a base.
[31:13] So if you're putting $10 for Dash, you have to put $10 for Cacao
[31:17] and put them in an LP together. Now, the reason Cacao exists is because when you do a swap,
[31:24] what actually happens, let's say I go Bitcoin Dash in a swap.
[31:27] What actually happened in the kitchen was a Bitcoin to Cacao swap,
[31:33] and then a Cacao to Dash swap. And it essentially left yield in both of the pools, right?
[31:41] And this is essentially how things work. People add to one chain or the other,
[31:48] and Cacao is always kind of the middleman. The price reference, it sets the exchange rate,
[31:54] and that's more or less how that works, which is why we need people adding both assets.
[32:01] They're kind of investing into a pool to get the yield out of the utility of the exchange.
[32:07] And this is very rapid. It's on code, right?
[32:09] And Dash, both Dash and Maya, have very fast confirmation time and kind of finality.
[32:17] So you're talking about being able to just be doing swaps back and forth, back and forth,
[32:21] all day, generating a lot of money velocity, which is essentially where the yield comes from.
[32:28] - Okay. So let's talk a little bit about the infrastructure
[32:31] that is running this whole process. I learned just last week, like maybe some others did,
[32:39] that the Dash incubator intends to run what is called a Genesis node.
[32:45] So is this still in the plans? And if so, does that mean the incubator
[32:51] participates in some liquidity pools or not at all, because the node is different from that?
[32:57] Somebody clarify that for us. - I'm happy to jump in here.
[33:01] It's really an interesting case with Maya because there has to be nodes to launch with,
[33:08] but there is no asset to bond with initially to actually launch those nodes.
[33:13] It's given to several trusted parties, the sort of authority to be a temporary node operator.
[33:19] So all the transactions still happen on the nodes, but those nodes are not currently bonded with Cacao,
[33:25] but they will be bonded with Cacao in the future, at which point the Genesis nodes
[33:29] who are here for this brief period, where a firm will roll out and the bonded nodes
[33:35] will then bond in and they'll be part of a churn and they'll come into the place.
[33:40] So Dash incubator and Dash as a sort of trusted partner has been chosen to operate one of these Genesis nodes
[33:48] to help launch the entire project and get it kicked off, help with the liquidity auction and just get Maya geared up
[33:57] to have that deep liquidity in those pools because you've got this chicken and egg problem
[34:02] where you can't trade without liquidity, but you can't add liquidity until there's some trading,
[34:07] there's no desire to. So you need to sort of launch
[34:10] and gear up towards this launch. And as Cacao is awarded and people bond in those nodes,
[34:17] then those nodes are bonded with real assets rather than any sort of trust or pseudo asset.
[34:22] And that's when the whole system is fully launched. - So it sounds like there's a fair bit of communication
[34:28] between Ash and Alux anyway, or will be leading up to the day of launch.
[34:32] - There has been, we have a discord group like with Rion, Ash and Alex,
[34:39] which is the guy also doing all the code, by the way, terrific job he did.
[34:43] So do thank him from me. Yeah, we've been in close contact for a few weeks now.
[34:51] We've even had the Dash Bifrost audited by Halborn already with remediations already in place.
[34:59] So you can see that audit on docs.mayaprotocol.com/audits. And you'll see there the final report for Dash Bifrost.
[35:10] So pretty great job there, obviously security first. You can see all audits we've done in Maya there as well.
[35:18] And yeah, right now on the Discord channel, if you go and follow Maya there,
[35:23] you'll see a channel called Genesis Nodes. And we've been, for the last four or five days,
[35:28] constantly communicating quite a bit, yeah, very busy. - Can only imagine.
[35:34] So then that leads to basically one final question from me. And that is what kind of maintenance work
[35:44] or further development work might be required on the Dash integration after launch, if any at all?
[35:53] - I think one of the most important things for me is to improve the usage of it.
[35:59] The value that we add to Dash in to Maya is all related to the volume of transactions
[36:04] that go through it. If we can integrate Maya straight into the Dash wallet,
[36:09] into our partners like Edge, we'll be able to improve that utility.
[36:15] Even people who want to open a shared Dash node on CrowdNode could go via Maya.
[36:19] There's so much use for this whole solution of exchange. Exchange is one of the biggest things
[36:25] in the whole crypto sphere right now. And the more we develop towards enabling
[36:30] and improving that integration and deploying that integration in wallets and elsewhere,
[36:36] the better, really. - Yeah, and just ongoing maintenance,
[36:42] there has to be some work done there. As Maya also is kind of, through upgrades,
[36:49] there are just things that you need to review that are still working on Maya.
[36:55] Thankfully, on Dash, sorry. Thankfully, Bifrost, which is kind of the module
[36:59] within Maya and Thornchain that handles all of these kind of external chains,
[37:04] is the one that changes the least in the ecosystem because it's just the largest attack surface
[37:11] and just the most conservative place. And it's essentially just maintaining
[37:16] the threshold signature scheme in the wallet of the target chain.
[37:21] So it's nodes running wallets on the chain that have this threshold signature scheme,
[37:27] which is like a multi-seq, but larger, that is both observing transactions and signing transactions.
[37:34] And that thing also depends on Dash. So if Dash ever has an upgrade,
[37:38] we also have to look at the Bifrost to make sure everything's fine.
[37:44] The thing is that chains also typically want to keep how wallets work very, very stable
[37:52] and not change it too much because a small change in how a wallet works in Dash
[37:56] requires a lot of work here by Ash and team and just Dash in general to go to all of their integrations,
[38:05] apps, everywhere and change it. So for that reason, it's very rare
[38:11] that we will actually have to do major reworks or maintenance on this integration,
[38:17] but inevitably sometimes there will have to be a bit. - I think you will have to keep the node up to date,
[38:22] our Dash node up to date, the software for that, and just little bits of maintenance.
[38:27] The largest change I can foresee coming isn't an essential change.
[38:32] It's as we release Dash platform and have usernames,
[38:35] we may wish to integrate usernames in some capacity, but because Dash is always going to be backwards compatible,
[38:41] that can be left down the line. We can have that year, two years from now,
[38:45] and it will be thoroughly battle-tested before it ever reaches anything live.
[38:49] And that would be effectively probably just resolving a username to an address
[38:54] and having some relationship with the node there. - Well, that sounds exciting.
[39:00] Usernames with a DEX, that's really starting to talk business.
[39:05] So if we're expecting a launch in March, that's pretty much coming up soon.
[39:15] We'll stay tuned. Does anybody have any final comments or questions before?
[39:20] Oh, we do have- - That was a good question in chat.
[39:22] Yeah, I was just going to say, so obviously Maya's launching in March.
[39:25] The goal is then following that launch for Dash to be added as the first chain.
[39:30] The question is though, it's interesting how it's phrased.
[39:32] It's like, when will Dash be on ThorChain? There is a cross-DEX sort of communication sort of plan
[39:40] between Maya and ThorChain. Alex, briefly, could you give us
[39:43] a very high level overview of what that looks like, how assets can move between the ThorChain forks
[39:50] and how that works? - Sure.
[39:52] So one of the major things we worked on as Maya was obviously like looking to join forces
[39:59] with other DEXs like ThorChain and Maya. So the closer we are, the better.
[40:05] At the end of the day, the main competitor here, like the enemy, is Central Exchange,
[40:10] and that's who we want to topple. So because of that, you gain a major advantage
[40:16] if your two DEXs, although different, running different chains,
[40:20] can both aggregate between each other and arbitrage between each other.
[40:25] So because of that, one of the things we developed is a Maya-to-ThorChain bifrost,
[40:31] which essentially means Maya will have a ThorChain pool in Maya, so a room cacao pool.
[40:38] And what this allows is for you to be able to move yourself swiftly from Maya
[40:45] to ThorChain-supported assets seamlessly, and also for quick arbitrage to happen
[40:52] between both networks so they share the same pricing. So because of that, as soon as Dash is on Maya,
[41:00] Dash is essentially on ThorChain. You can go ahead and swap Dash to AVAX or Dash to Doge
[41:06] or Dash to Atom, those three assets we won't be supporting in Maya,
[41:12] but you can swap across decentralized this way. So it just requires you to jump through one more hoop,
[41:21] which is just one more pool. Instead of going through two pools, you're going through three.
[41:26] - So Dash, Cacao, to Rune, to BTC, for example. - Yeah, no, Dash, BTC, you can just jump within Maya.
[41:35] - Okay, for Atom, AVAX, whatever coin is on Dark. So could it be that you would go from Dash to Cacao
[41:44] to Rune to Dark to PirateCoin, whatever's coming on the Dark exchange?
[41:52] So you could have series of hops from any asset to any asset.
[41:56] - Yeah, exactly. At the beginning, it would be like two signature thing.
[42:00] So you're getting first two, for instance, for Dash to Doge, you'd go like Dash, Rune on Maya,
[42:06] and then just sign one more transaction, Rune to Doge. But that can actually be also aggregated on code
[42:13] such that eventually you also just do Dash. And when you say the asset I want is Doge,
[42:19] Maya automatically will do that for you. So what the code will do is say,
[42:25] okay, just put that you want Dash, sorry, that you want Doge and your Doge address.
[42:30] And what we will do is just send it over to Rune. And when we send it to Rune,
[42:35] the Rune, we will send it to Thorchains Reserve with the instructions to give you your Doge.
[42:41] So that would all happen just with one signature, which is obviously the best UX.
[42:46] We will get there, just give us a few months to first, yeah, just warm up essentially.
[42:54] Then we can get more crazy with that. And then you can also even go to aggregators.
[42:58] So you will be able to go from Dash to any asset in Avalanche with just one click,
[43:04] which would be breathtaking to watch. - Sorry, Javier.
[43:08] - Yeah, we'll see. - I have to add on that note that
[43:12] one of the, just bringing it a little more high level, one of the reasons why I'm so interested
[43:18] in Dash being on a DEX is, a lot of the examples that we gave was,
[43:24] Dash to this, Dash to this, to this, to this. One of the reasons that I think it's so important
[43:30] that we have this is that other projects can go back into Dash or into Dash for the first time.
[43:37] So if you're one of those crazy kids that just bought into the hype of Dogecoin or whatever,
[43:44] just 'cause you thought number go up and this is great, this is fun.
[43:48] I have some friends that have done this by the way. - Me too.
[43:52] - At some point, they're going to realize they want to actually use this in the real world
[43:56] and they want to actually use it as a currency, like this whole industry was intended to be done.
[44:02] And they're going to want to take their Dogecoin and their joke and their meme coins,
[44:08] or even their Bitcoins if the Bitcoin fees go up again and whatnot, they can go into Dash
[44:16] and then from Dash into goods and services. And that's what our whole goal is with Dash
[44:21] is to actually get into a new economy where we have an asset that's more reliable
[44:28] than all of our nation state fiat currencies. To bring it back into that intro reel,
[44:35] there's just so many problems with national currencies. I mean, you saw the first clip was about,
[44:42] banks are getting 4.5% interest on our money that we park with the banks,
[44:47] and then they're passing on like fractions of a percent to us, that needs to stop.
[44:53] And Maya will help us stop that because now you can have Dash savers,
[44:57] where if you have some Dash that you want to save because you're investing into this economy,
[45:03] then you can get some yield on that, which is what a primitive
[45:07] that every monetary system should have is the ability for savers to get some yield
[45:12] on their savings. So the high level for Maya is you've got some Dash,
[45:18] you want some yield on that, you want some interest, whatever you want to call it,
[45:22] you throw it into this, and you throw it into the Maya as a liquidity provider,
[45:28] and basically you've got some yield. So it's an alternative to master nodes.
[45:33] It will compete with that. And because of both options being there,
[45:38] the yield will be higher for both because there's just more uses for Dash,
[45:43] more use. - It's like we may have lost Rion there.
[45:49] - Yeah, we have lost Rion. I'm sure he'll come back.
[45:53] And to expound or to rather clarify what you had said about the yield, Rion,
[46:01] would it be true that for Dash holders who want a trustless solution
[46:08] and who don't currently have the hundred Dash to participate in say, crowd nodes, trustless hosting,
[46:14] that yield earning through Maya would be the trustless option for them to take,
[46:20] having that sub 100 Dash amount? - I'll go ahead and say something about that.
[46:25] And then maybe Alux can say something about that. 'Cause there's this funny little word that we use
[46:30] called trustless. And I think it's a little bit of a-
[46:34] - Misnomer. - It's a little bit of a misnomer
[46:36] because there's trust everywhere that you have to have. So trustless, I wouldn't use that word
[46:42] for anything in cryptocurrency, but trust minimized for sure.
[46:48] - Yeah, I like that word too. - When you're sending your Dash into the Maya protocol,
[46:53] you're trusting a protocol and you're trusting many, many, many operators
[46:59] that have the financial economic incentives for it to run smoothly and well,
[47:04] as opposed to trusting a single third party custodian with your Dash, which in the case of Crowdnode might be fine
[47:13] 'cause they have a good track record and we trust them. They're part of our community,
[47:18] but still they're more like a trusted third party. But even worse, if you sent your money into BitGo
[47:26] or whatever, that's definitely a trusted third party and very far away from the trustless side of the spectrum.
[47:32] So yeah, to answer your question, yes, you would be able to use Maya to get more trustless.
[47:39] In other words, ironically, more trusted. You can really trust that more than a third party custodian.
[47:49] - And the beautiful thing also on Maya is that you have proof of reserves
[47:55] and proof of liquidity anytime. Like the addresses for the vaults in each chain are public.
[48:03] You can today just go and see how much Bitcoin forging has and does it match up with what they're claiming they have.
[48:10] And it's also proof of liquidity because every seven days that liquidity is sent to another vault.
[48:15] So they're even showing that they have the ability to move it around, which is also another thing
[48:20] that sometimes is not the case. I can point to, hey, this is my wallet.
[48:25] Look, I have many Bitcoins, but I don't really have the ability to move it
[48:29] without somebody else's permission or signature. So the fact that we are showing like,
[48:35] there's this dash that you have in an LP position or in savers, and look, it's right there.
[48:40] That's the address on that chain with your money on it. And look, we're moving it around now.
[48:45] See, it's there, you can use it. So even if this trust-minimized system does rely on nodes,
[48:53] these nodes are heavily bonded and they lose more than they gain if they misbehave.
[48:59] The code, it's also trusting the code in some shape or form, but it's been battle-tested, it's been audited,
[49:05] and we'll see. Also, don't rush on going on Maya with your life savings.
[49:11] Watch it, watch it work. See how it's going. - Don't tell me
[49:14] what to do, Alux. - Yeah.
[49:16] (laughing) Yeah.
[49:17] (laughing) - Putting everything on the...
[49:19] - Yeah, but over time, we have to earn your confidence too. We have to execute, we have to do well.
[49:28] Code and DeFi is tricky. So also take your time.
[49:31] Support us, that'd be great if you can invest something, but wait, hold on on your life savings.
[49:38] Just please be cautious. But over time, as let's say two years from now,
[49:45] Maya is by far one of the best options to swap. The good thing about swapping also
[49:51] is that swapping happens easily. You have full custody of your assets,
[49:55] then you perform the swap and receive the funds again in a wallet of your custody.
[50:00] So that's different to us, like using Binance, where you send the money to Binance,
[50:05] and only once in Binance can you do the exchange. The money, you receive it on Binance
[50:10] and you have to actively withdraw it. And during that whole time,
[50:13] it was like under that third party's custody. Here, you have it on your wallet,
[50:19] you perform the swap, a few seconds or minutes later, you have your asset again in your custody,
[50:24] which is for swappers, I think, much, much safer. The time that I mentioned being so short makes risks.
[50:32] - It's like an interim level of trust, yeah. Quick question, brass tacks, dates and stuff.
[50:38] Based on your forecast, when will people be able to add Dash liquidity to Maya?
[50:44] And following that, when will be your expectation of when people could trade with Dash as a pair?
[50:52] - So our target now is before 10th of April. So that's what we've published in our roadmap.
[50:59] For you guys to know more or less what's going on, we're launching in March with a liquidity auction
[51:04] where anybody can add BTC, ETH or RUNE to the pools, and we will give Kakao away for free.
[51:11] Like all of Kakao, well, 90%, because 10% goes to a reserve owned by the protocol.
[51:17] So that 90%-- - Could you just go through those launch assets again?
[51:21] What are the launch assets that you could add yield to to take part in that auction?
[51:25] - BTC, RUNE itself, unfortunately, ETH, and also USDT and USDC, the asset 20,
[51:31] which are important for arbitrage. - And are those only symmetric or asymmetric?
[51:36] So the dual asset, two assets, or the single asset models? - So this is dual, but you're adding BTC
[51:45] and we're donating the Kakao to your position. So you just-- - I see, okay.
[51:49] - Are paying for half of the position, you're getting the other half for free.
[51:52] And now you're a dual LP. And no Kakao will be minted again.
[51:57] So it's like a great opportunity for people to start. And all Kakao starts circulating in pools,
[52:03] doing what's intended to do and fairly distributed to people that support it or launch, which is great.
[52:08] So that happens through March, and it happens for a few weeks so people don't rush,
[52:12] and they can do their own research, due diligence, calmly take a rational and sound decision.
[52:18] We hate hype here, we hate rush, like just take an informed decision.
[52:23] And then after March ends, we donate all the Kakao into the pools,
[52:28] and we enable trading. And as soon as we kind of just perform a few swaps,
[52:33] everything's ready, everything's fine, we do two things. One is prepare Dash for mainnet.
[52:39] And second is prepare the first few bonded nodes to come in. And we will perform a churn.
[52:45] And as soon as that churn happens, if everything works out well,
[52:48] it brings in the first few bonded nodes and it brings in Dash.
[52:52] Then once Dash is on Maya, it's just a question of doing some sanity checks,
[52:58] adding seed liquidity to the pool, and then opening it up for anybody to have liquidity
[53:02] and trade. - What would be your target for seed liquidity?
[53:06] In a fiat value as far as US dollars, what would be your sort of target?
[53:10] - So the seed liquidity is essentially just the very first liquidity
[53:14] so that there is something there, and then anybody else can just add liquidity after.
[53:18] I would say anything around 100 to $200,000 is great. And then, which is, it's not a lot, honestly.
[53:26] Obviously, the deeper it is, and look, there's a dog here.
[53:29] (laughing) Sorry for that.
[53:31] But yeah, like anybody can add, and it will always be a function of volume.
[53:40] So the deeper the pool is, the more volume it has, because swaps are more affordable,
[53:46] and affordability increases demand. So we want that pool to be very deep.
[53:52] But also, trade volume generates fees, which gives APY. And the more people we have,
[53:58] that APY is also diluted across a larger capital base. So the market eventually just finds its equilibrium,
[54:06] and I don't know where that's gonna be. It can be like a million-dollar depth.
[54:09] It can be $2 million depth. - We do have a question on that note
[54:12] whilst we're pulling numbers out of the sky. There is a question is,
[54:15] what has been the average return from bonding with exchanges like Maya?
[54:19] I guess we could look at a comparable for LTC on ThorChain, for example.
[54:26] What could a masternode owner, or anyone in the Dash community
[54:30] who's interested in providing liquidity, what could they hope for on a return?
[54:35] What yield could they hope for? Again, numbers from the sky, I know.
[54:39] - Yeah, it's variable at the end of the day, and it depends.
[54:42] Like, what are we talking about? The dual LP or the single side LP?
[54:46] Like the savers. - What's most common?
[54:48] Well, savers is probably the safer option. I dare say a lot of people will choose that, so.
[54:52] - Yeah, I've seen numbers between 4% and 8%, depends on the asset on ThorChain.
[54:59] And then for dual LP, depends as well. The higher the swapping, the better, obviously.
[55:07] But I've seen anywhere between 10% and 20%. Now, it's completely variable.
[55:12] So this is not coming out of like us subsidizing or anything. Initially, MYAS would probably also be a bit lower
[55:21] while we get, like Ash said, integrated to Edge, integrated to UIs, to wallets, to Trust Wallet.
[55:27] Maybe you guys don't know, but Trust Wallet is already using ThorChain.
[55:31] So we want them to use MYA too, right? So as we get more integrations,
[55:35] we will increase the volume, and that should increase also the APY you receive.
[55:40] So just be on the lookout for that. Depends on the asset, depends on the volume.
[55:45] If many people are doing what Brian was saying, like many people are going to Dash to use it,
[55:50] and then once they get paid in Dash, they convert it sometimes to BTC,
[55:53] and people are just using it, and it's useful. Well, you're gonna get paid better for adding your liquidity.
[56:00] You're doing a more valuable thing by putting your liquidity and the market is recognizing that.
[56:06] So yeah, it will depend. Thankfully, it's all on-chain,
[56:11] so you can just go see and query those APYs, see if it's a good use case for yourself,
[56:19] and go ahead and try it out. - Right on.
[56:24] Well, I think that we have just all had a full education in various things today.
[56:28] At least I know I have. Thank all of you gentlemen
[56:32] for your time and contributions today, Alux and Ash for joining us,
[56:37] and then of course, my co-host Rion. So that is it for us at Incubator Weekly today, folks,
[56:44] and we're looking forward to seeing you next week again. Same time, same place.
[56:49] - Thank you guys.
