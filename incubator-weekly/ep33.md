[00:00] Recently, the Coin Bureau crew released a 20-minute video that brought to light Project FAST, which stands for Frictionless, Affordable, Safe, Timely Transactions.
[00:13] That sounds ideal, but not in the way it's being constructed. A World Bank document describes FAST as being "supported by central infrastructures which
[00:21] enable banks and non-banks to connect and to build additional overlay services for end users," sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:31] In addition to the World Bank and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Guy from Coin Bureau notes the involvement of the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, the World
[00:39] Economic Forum, and the Bank for International Settlements, who all seem to be collaborating toward the same goal.
[00:45] To convert all payment systems into FAST payment systems and convert all FAST payment systems into central bank digital currencies, setting the stage for a global CVDC system.
[00:58] As Guy notes, this system would "combine the individual and institutional electronic payment systems together."
[01:06] But why stop there? Why not tokenize every asset in existence and put it on this system so that every single
[01:15] transaction and asset in the economy can be totally controlled? In the words of Hsiung-Shiong Shin, head of research at the Bank for International Settlements,
[01:24] "A unified ledger with CVDCs can make full use of the ability of central bank money to knit together diverse elements of the financial system.
[01:34] In this sense, the full potential of tokenization can be harnessed by having central bank money reside on the same venue as other tokenized claims."
[01:44] Translation, use FAST payment systems for assets, not just payments. As Andreas Antonopoulos rightly points out, "The thing you have to really be careful
[01:55] with with central bank digital currencies is that you're not just looking at a currency, you're looking at a currency with an integrated command control and surveillance system.
[02:07] It's the whole package." So we must remain vigilant, especially as Guy details, because much of this is being
[02:13] executed behind the scenes. The caveat with FAST payments is that most people have no idea that when they sign up
[02:20] to use them, they're signing up for a CVDC in the future. Further through the standardization of payment messaging structure like ISO 20022.
[02:30] ISO 20022 is the most standardized message with predefined structure, syntax, and format. Most cryptos like Stellar and Ripple use ISO 20022, as do most of the 40 countries already
[02:44] utilizing the FAST payment structure, including the US Federal Reserve's FedNow, which just rolled out, and Brazil's central bank's PIX, which rolled out over two and a half years
[02:53] ago. If you have anything to do with Brazil, you have probably heard of PIX.
[02:57] PIX is our central bank's payment system, and it's mandatory for all banks to adopt it.
[03:04] PIX is instant, and you receive it right away, of course. Nobody pays fees in transactions by PIX, which has made financial transactions in Brazil
[03:14] much easier for consumers and businesses in general. One commenter on the Beam Discord noted that PIX is hugely popular there, and with the
[03:23] majority of the population now using it, it's processed almost 9 billion transactions. But to zoom out, we know the incentives of these outfits.
[03:31] The incentive for the private sector is greater profits, at least in theory. For the public sector, the incentive is control, mainly geopolitical control.
[03:42] To grow in size and scope, to accrue power. If the architecture is a pyramid, someone will climb to the top.
[03:49] Changing people at the top doesn't change the architecture. Corruption will flow upwards and they will become corrupt too.
[03:57] That's why the only way to prevent fast payment systems and CBDCs from achieving mass adoption is through education, and by pointing people to safer alternatives that can't
[04:09] be controlled. Indeed, it's these safer alternatives that can't be controlled, decentralized cryptocurrencies
[04:15] being used for payments, that are bringing true competition, that are causing the aforementioned outfits to scramble to retain power, as is acknowledged in a World Bank publication.
[04:26] Crypto assets appear to be on the rise globally, including some that certain individuals and firms consider to be a medium of exchange.
[04:35] Education is important, but we must not stop there. We have to starve the parasites.
[04:41] And the first thing that needs to be broken is the cartel of money. And the way we do that is by exiting and using peer-to-peer money.
[04:51] Crypto has a head start and is much faster. All we need to do is keep up the pace and we will win the race.
[05:15] Good morning, everyone. As you can see, I am the solo host today.
[05:21] We usually have Amanda B. Johnson with us, but she's taking the week off, should be here next week, but I haven't confirmed that yet.
[05:31] So we will look forward to that. But today, I have as my guest, as you can see on the screen, Doc Agnew, also known as
[05:42] Agnew Pickens on the Discord, and actually known as Michael, right? Yeah, Michael, that's my name, and I just changed it up a bit.
[06:00] You mentioned in the pre-show that that was okay that I say that, just so everybody knows. So Michael, what are we talking about today?
[06:10] I noticed in the incubator, we had a new concept from you, and I will bring that up shortly. But before I do that, we'll just go ahead and get a little brief introduction of who
[06:25] you are, why you're into Dash, how you kind of got here real briefly, and then we'll launch into the topic, which is economics and Dash economics, and certain things that we can
[06:39] do to maybe improve that. So go ahead.
[06:41] I've been around Dash since 2016. I had started out in Ethereum during the Homestead days, and realized there wasn't going to be
[06:52] a coin that would work for what I wanted, which is that I would like merchant options. I'm a small vendor of stuff that I sell, and publish books, and some art materials, and
[07:08] I wanted a payment coin, and that's how I came to Dash in late 2016, and I've been in different capacities here in this network now since then, from Discord moderator, Slack
[07:24] moderator, delegate for a couple of masternodes on the Dow board, where you see me on Dash central commenting every once in a while, and to get into the main motivation behind
[07:40] the concept, and European Central Bank hype rates yet again another 25 basis points, and I think to be competitive against these traditional finance yields, if we want to see more investment
[08:00] in masternodes, and Ebonodes, a temporary increase in emissions could draw in that outside investment in the structure, right now, and we're not seeing the mass count.
[08:19] It's been kind of flat for a long time, and I know it's upside down a little bit now as people spin up Ebonodes, but we're not really seeing a lot of people investing, and I think
[08:39] some of it is just the traditional finance yields are so high right now, the overnight rate for the Fed is almost 6%, so it's hard to compete against traditional finance at
[08:53] the current yields that masternodes are offering and Ebonodes as well. So if I could just kind of recap that in my own words, basically what you're seeing is
[09:05] in the traditional finance space, people have the option right now to invest dollars and basically get a yield on their dollars by simply purchasing very low risk Treasury securities,
[09:23] and those are running up near or exceeding 5% now, and that's like a very safe asset, which is the U.S. dollar and a very safe security, which is a Treasury security.
[09:36] So it's almost no risk, and it's certainly no exchange rate risk, if anything, dollars are appreciating compared to other national currencies right now, and also in the past
[09:51] several years has been appreciating against Dash, or in other words, Dash has been depreciating in terms of dollars.
[09:59] So that seems like a very tasty treat for investors, and what you're saying is, hey, can we increase our yields because we have a higher risk, we also have a higher potential
[10:12] reward with appreciation on Dash, but it's much higher risk. So you're saying, can we increase our yields to compensate for the higher risk and compete
[10:25] against traditional finance yields? Yeah, pretty much that.
[10:32] I think we have to be aware of the forces in the market, because we're not just in this crypto goldfish bowl, we are subject to what happens in traditional finance.
[10:46] We have to be able to adapt to conditions in the wider market, and right now, people are not looking for low yields in crypto, I mean, they're looking for the higher yield
[11:03] products to make it worth their while, when you can get four and a half, five percent on a money market, and not even have to buy an instrument or tie up your money, you know,
[11:16] it's hard to compete on an even footing with that for a risk asset like Dash. I think the current yield is about 8%, which is not enough of a margin above, on a master
[11:32] notice, it's about 8%, I think, the last I looked. Yeah, that's only 2 or 3% above what TradPi is offering, and the central banks are not
[11:49] signaling that they're going to turn around and start cutting rates any time soon. I think we're in an extended period of high interest rates until something breaks, you
[12:02] know, which can always happen. At which point, they might lower their interest rates on the treasury securities, and then,
[12:11] you know, maybe Dash would look better compared to treasury yields at that point, but it's very likely that they might stay, as they say in the macro, higher for longer.
[12:24] Okay, so I wanted to also just give my, let's see, one-time states, I hope they'll discuss the pros and cons of Agnew's idea compared to other block reward reallocation ideas that
[12:37] have also been considered. So yes, we're, I'm going to discuss that right now, actually.
[12:44] I wanted to give a little bit of a high-level overview of why I thought this was an interesting concept and why I accepted this into the incubator as something that we can, that we will dedicate
[12:57] some resources to, because, you know, typically, the incubator is working on development, software development projects, and that's almost exclusively what we do.
[13:12] But as I'm looking around, and I've seen actually for several years, we need some significant economic changes.
[13:22] We have the best technology in terms of security, in terms of speed of payments and settlements, in terms of just how secure our blockchain is against things like 51% attacks with technology
[13:41] with chain locks and instance end, and we even have some fairly robust privacy technology. So Dash really has very good technology in terms of the software development, but I think
[13:57] that we need some improvement in our economics, because you look at our price, right? You look at our price history, and for the past several years, we've just been decreasing
[14:09] both in terms of U.S. dollar exchange rate, but also in terms of, like, if you put it in terms of Bitcoin, or even some of the other altcoins, Dash is decreasing and declining
[14:24] in the market cap rankings. So you have to ask yourself, why?
[14:28] If we have the best technology that I can see, and I think that we do, in cryptocurrency, why is that not reflected in our price?
[14:38] And so you have to admit that it may be that investors aren't necessarily looking just for technology, they're looking for other things.
[14:48] And the economics might be part of that. So I want to dedicate some resources to this, doing some, I accepted the concept in a more
[14:58] broad sense of Dash economic research and development. So Pete, if you could turn on my screen share for a minute, I'm just going to go through
[15:08] first, the original concept and project that we're working with on Trello. So the high level description there, there's more detail in the concept, which I've linked
[15:24] to in this project board right here. As you can see, this is Trello.com/economics/R&D.
[15:32] And this board has always been public, so it's pretty easy to find. The original concept is linked here on this project board.
[15:41] And I made a couple notes when I approved the project here about how I, what direction I think that we should take with it.
[15:50] And then Michael has a comment here that you can read as well. And we've discussed a lot of that already.
[15:57] But this, as you can see, we're just starting this project. So we're, we don't have anything, we don't have anything to propose right now.
[16:06] We don't have anything to, yeah, it's not final. This is, this is one of those projects that we're covering at the early stages so that
[16:14] people kind of know what we're working on. And I'll just give this description, a read here, it says, in a high rate environment
[16:21] with TradFi yields for Masternodes and Evo nodes, Masternodes and Evo nodes are simply not high enough to compete in the market at the moment.
[16:29] Primary goal here is to get more interest in outside investment into the network. And that's sort of the summary of Michael's concept.
[16:36] We already discussed that. Now I wanted to go briefly into a few spreadsheets that I had made a little while ago, but just
[16:49] I can use them as a launch pad to discuss some of the options that we both have looked at and that how this new concept compares to those ones that we've had in the past.
[17:04] So one times question, essentially. So this is a spreadsheet that is basically calculating, it's every month it shows the
[17:23] block subsidy in terms of dash per block over time. So it starts back here in 2017.
[17:30] That's obviously not the beginning of the project, but that's the beginning of how long I've done this analysis and it's sufficient for what I was using it for before.
[17:38] But if you come down here to today's date, this is the past, this yellow one is the one that we've just passed, the super block.
[17:51] And you can see that the total base subsidy right now is 2.56 dash per block. If you split out and just consider the miners and the masternode portion of that, in other
[18:02] words, excluding the Treasury, that's 2.31. And then here's our allocation schedule that started up here at 50% and then is currently
[18:14] transitioning to towards 60% for masternode allocation. Ignore these grayed out proposed things for a minute.
[18:24] I'm not talking about that specifically today, but if you come over here to the masternode dash per block subsidy, you can see it's 1.332 and you could confirm that on a block explorer.
[18:38] But basically now I'm going to bring you back in here, Michael, to kind of talk about what you were thinking about in terms of an actual proposal.
[18:48] But that's the end of my high-level discussion about why I think this is important. But tell us what you had in mind in terms of a potential proposal.
[18:59] Well, I was thinking getting up to roughly a 50% hike in yields for masternodes. I mean, the exact math would have to be figured out on it, but that would take us up and it
[19:19] would keep us competitive against, because we're looking at potential yields of 6% now as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank continue to hike against their already
[19:34] accepted currencies, the euro and the dollar. It's just I don't feel there's enough incentive for people to say, "Hey, I'm going to take
[19:49] my dollars or my euros and I'm going to buy a masternode or an Ebonode, or I'm going to stake some in Crowdnode."
[19:57] And this is another side benefit, Crowdnode is bleeding cash like crazy right now because of the low debt and increasing the block reward would help things like that, would also expand
[20:12] the treasury by the expansion in the block reward. Masternode owners would earn more existing masternodes.
[20:26] And raise the block reward temporarily, and there's some mathematical formula sweet spot where we can stay within the original supply gap.
[20:37] But if we increase the emissions right now, we could potentially even go to the miners and say, "Hey, we're increasing emissions, but we're reducing your allocation," and leave
[20:49] them at about the same point where they would have been before the increase in emissions. Right.
[20:56] Yeah. So I just wanted to explain these last three columns.
[21:02] Go ahead. I was just going to explain these last three columns in case people were wondering, because
[21:07] you touched on it as well. This column I is just the masternode subsidy in Dash per year per masternode.
[21:15] So it assumes a certain number of masternodes, and I have in here 3,426. It obviously changes, but I think that was the latest number that I had.
[21:25] And then that results in 77.9 Dash per year for that 1,000 Dash masternode, which is the same as saying 7.79 or 7.8% yield, and that's what you were talking about, close to 8% yield
[21:41] is what we have. And as you can see, as we increase the allocation over time toward that schedule that's already
[21:48] been put in place in the Ryan Taylor era, this towards 60%, you can see that the masternode yields are increasing if everything stays constant, but we're not going to get much
[22:02] more than 8% as you scroll down here. And then eventually every year, as you know, the Dash block reward reduces by one divided
[22:13] by 14 or 7% or something like that per year. And so that drops it back down.
[22:20] And then we eventually reached this 60% in sometime around 2025, 5/23. So one of the proposals is to kind of redo this allocation.
[22:31] You can see in this gray that I've already been kind of noodling on some things myself, maybe potentially increasing that to 80%.
[22:39] But what you're saying, Michael, if we combined what you're saying with what I have in this rough proposal, it's not even a proposal, it's just modeling out some ideas.
[22:50] If we combine them and maybe just say like we target increasing this base subsidy, just some round number like three, and then decreasing the minor reward.
[23:07] But if we increase the block subsidy temporarily, again, like you said, over time, and then this would be three and just, again, these details aren't done yet.
[23:22] That would increase this yield over here to closer to 10%. While the miners, even though their allocation is decreasing, they might be a static or close
[23:33] to a static level of allocation when it comes down to the Dash per year. Their allocation goes down, but the Dash that they're getting might not.
[23:43] And so there are a lot of details that we have to iron out on this, but that's the general concept.
[23:48] Sorry, go ahead. Fortunately, we haven't run through so much of our total supply that we can do something
[23:56] creative like this, whereas it would be hard for a coin like VSV that is at roughly 90% of its supply cap to be able to do anything with their emissions as far as stepping on
[24:16] the gas for a bit through this crypto bear market. And that's all I'm really looking at is a step on the gas to get us through this high
[24:27] rate environment in trad buy markets and hopefully come out stronger on the other side of it when we begin the reductions again.
[24:38] But it does look like we're going to be in an extended high-rate environment for traditional finance.
[24:44] From all the guidance we're getting out of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, they're not indicating any sort of pause yet.
[24:59] And the terminal rate looks to be like six and a half to six and three quarters percent is where the Fed looks like it's heading at the pace that they're still hiking.
[25:13] And then they're not even going to pivot unless something great, major happens and they have to.
[25:18] There's no telling how long we'll be in a high-rate environment. Yeah.
[25:26] Okay. So I wanted to make a couple of comments on that.
[25:29] There's two things to wrap up what you were saying. You're saying you're saying and suggesting let's increase the gas a little bit by increasing
[25:39] our block reward, but then we bring it back down at some other point so that we aren't actually increasing the total supply cap that we already have planned, which is something
[25:53] around $18M, $19M or something like that. So maybe one way to do that could be details aren't important right now, just kind of illustrating
[26:10] the concept. And I also wanted to say one other thing about this is we're not necessarily, at least my
[26:17] opinion, we're not trying to just react to what other currencies, like reacting to the Federal Reserve and the ECB necessarily.
[26:32] We're just trying to compete and acknowledging that we have to compete in this global market because that's just the reality.
[26:40] But the reality is also that they're actually kind of reacting to us. The whole push for central bank digital currencies and they're trying to keep up with the crypto
[26:51] scene as well. So it's everybody's trying to compete with each other in different ways.
[26:56] And obviously, one of the benefits that we'll have is we value privacy and competition and not monopolies and total surveillance like the intro was talking about.
[27:09] But I can foresee some people thinking like, OK, these guys are trying to tinker, right? They're trying to tinker.
[27:20] One of the things that I've noticed is a lot of people kind of have an attitude of we just need to kind of set it and forget it and stop messing with things and just kind of like
[27:33] let it go. And I don't believe that that's a good approach.
[27:37] If you look at monetary systems, the world around, what you'll see is a very high degree of planning.
[27:48] And I think everybody obviously knows that. But what you also see is they're hugely successful.
[27:54] So we need to acknowledge that the people that are orchestrating in the Federal Reserve and the dollar like U.S. dollars, these people are masters like we need to take a little
[28:07] bit of humble pie and say these people are doing something right. They might be doing a lot of things wrong, but they've gained near global adoption for
[28:18] the U.S. dollar. And we need to acknowledge that.
[28:22] It's like Gammon, I forget his first name, George Gammon kind of talks about this a little bit.
[28:31] You need to acknowledge that you're going up against a huge heavyweight fighter and you're just a little pipsqueak.
[28:38] And you kind of have a lot of heart and you've been in the gym and you've been training and whatnot.
[28:46] And that's the cryptocurrency scene. But we're just tiny compared to these guys.
[28:50] We need to learn from what they're doing and what they're doing is a high degree, a high level of planning because and it's been successful.
[29:01] So I think that we need to we need to adopt some of those strategies. Now, we have a different set of incentives, right?
[29:09] We have to we have to do this all on a voluntary basis. So we have an even bigger challenge in that sense that we need to do we need to gain adoption
[29:21] without using force and coercion and violence like they've been able to gain adoption with with U.S. dollars, for example, like you need to pay taxes and a lot of people say that's
[29:32] what creates demand for dollars in the first place is that you need to you need to pay taxes and that's what that's why you have to do that.
[29:41] I have a lot of ideas about that. I don't think that's the case that dollars aren't demanded because, you know, need to
[29:48] pay taxes or anything like that. So that's a little bit of a tangent, Michael.
[29:52] Go ahead and cut in here. And if you have anything that that I've well, I saw a comment about inflation on Dash and
[30:04] we're not we're going to stay within the original supply cap under this plan. We're still going to be a hard cap coin.
[30:13] All we're doing is we're stepping on the gas for a bit and then hitting the brakes because we've got we've got the luxury of having issued less than 60 percent of our total supply right
[30:24] now. So whereas a coin like BSP, if they want to do this, they've only got about a million
[30:31] and a half left of the 21 million. They're over 90 percent through their through their supply cap and they can't pull off something
[30:41] like this because they they just don't have that much left to work with, whereas Dash is in a better position to do something like this because we haven't run through so much
[30:57] of the supply. Yeah.
[30:59] Let me talk about that for a little bit. Pete, can you bring that comment back up?
[31:02] Because I was actually looking at my my others, my my spreadsheet still and I I had missed that.
[31:08] It's been coming up for a little while or sorry if I missed other ones, but let me just read this.
[31:13] Dandy says, I'm worried this is being considered. Haven't we learned anything from the failures of the fiat system?
[31:21] Increasing the amount of currency doesn't create more value. It hurts existing holders.
[31:25] This is a very, very important comment, and it's kind of what I was talking about without even having seen this comment yet, because a lot of people think this way.
[31:37] And I agree with a lot of what is being said here. So I agree that increasing the amount of currency doesn't create more value necessarily.
[31:48] But it's and he says it hurts the existing holders. This is not this is not a complete true statement.
[31:56] This is this can be true. Increasing the amount of currency may create more value and it may destroy value.
[32:06] We don't know. And the only way to know is you actually can't know for certain because history doesn't disclose
[32:16] its alternatives, as I like to think of. You don't know whether creating currency is creating value or destroying value because
[32:24] you don't you don't have an alternate universe to test the alternative in. And so you have to fall back on on theory and what what value actually is what it what
[32:37] it's defined to be. And this is this kind of gets back to some of the things that have been proposed in the
[32:43] past with you may have heard M&O plan or DCG plan. And then even before that, potentially, there was a proposal by a man named Foro, I think,
[32:55] on the forums. I hope I'm getting his name right, but he also made a comment in the in the Dash forum
[33:04] recently bringing it up again. So he's been thinking about this idea as well.
[33:10] And I just wanted to give him acknowledge that the good work that he's doing there as well.
[33:17] I don't have that forum post up, but Pete, if you have it, I dropped it in our group chat.
[33:24] If you have it, maybe you could you could post it on on the screen so that people can see where that is and have a link to it when they're watching this video later.
[33:36] But essentially, he was proposing to, hey, we need to have we need to have super block payouts coming out of masternode funds.
[33:47] In other words, if funds are left over in the super block, they should default to masternode owners.
[33:55] And the reason why this is important, and I agree that this is this is a good approach, which is why I proposed it a little while ago.
[34:03] The reason why that's important is because that's the only way that you you really have a good handle on creating value by creating value by creating Dash.
[34:16] If you think about it, some some current some crypto currencies, they'll dump a huge allocation of coins right at the beginning, and then there won't be any inflation after that.
[34:28] But they they allocate their coins to a certain to certain contingencies, whether those are VCs or whatnot.
[34:36] But every single project has to create coins to get them into circulation. And how you create coins makes all the difference and who you allocate those coins to.
[34:48] So right now we have three major contingencies in Dash. We have miners and we have masternode owners and we have treasury proposals.
[35:01] Those are the three main contingencies that we allocate newly created, newly minted Dash to.
[35:09] The proposal system, the superblock or treasury system, that's the only one where currently if if those aren't voted in, then those coins don't get created.
[35:22] And so we already kind of have a mechanism where masternodes could decide to, hey, this is not valuable.
[35:28] I'm not going to I'm not going to fund this. And then those coins don't get created.
[35:35] Now, we don't know whether that's valuable or we don't know whether that's creating value or destroying value relative to its alternatives, because we can't see those alternatives, obviously.
[35:47] And so this is this is economic theory. So I apologize for people who aren't really into this or aren't familiar with this.
[35:54] But that's the only way to actually know if there is value, potentially value, is if somebody has to give up something to to obtain it.
[36:07] So masternodes should have to give up part of their income to fund a treasury proposal. And that's how you know, at least that this masternode owner who voted yes for it thinks
[36:19] that that that newly created Dash will actually increase the value of the Dash that they hold in general.
[36:31] So let me just read this. This comment, Nostalgic says, increasing the supply is a short term gimmick, most mostly
[36:38] done by shit coins as they are dying, such as Uki, EPX, BNX, to name a few. I'm completely against this exercise.
[36:48] So this is this is totally predictable. I knew that there would be a lot of people opposed to this, even this concept in general.
[36:57] And we don't have time in this show to completely address all the concerns. I would just hope that people would at least understand that I personally, I am very, very
[37:12] interested in the success of this project. I think I think I've probably taken more risks in my personal life and even to my family
[37:28] in making this basically my career path. I was making more money before I joined full time in Dash.
[37:40] I love this project. So pardon me if I am a little bit dismissive of people commenting that this is just a gimmick.
[37:52] This is not a gimmick. I've probably studied more economics, both in the macro scene and in the crypto scene
[38:01] than anybody in the Dash community. I think I could probably say that.
[38:05] And I'm not saying that to boast. I'm just saying that to say I am speaking from a lot of research and a lot of experience.
[38:14] This is what I think needs to be done. Something like it.
[38:18] And again, we haven't actually laid out any concrete proposals. If you go back and watch, you'll see that the Trello project is for research and development.
[38:31] That actually is required before any kind of proposal can be made. But I will say that it's very easy to just say, you know, creating creating new Dash
[38:43] is just a gimmick. Again, I'm not going to address all this because there's too much to say about it for right
[38:53] now in this one episode. But I do think that it's that exploring something like this is absolutely necessary for the
[39:04] long term survival, let alone prosperity of this project. So Agnew, Doc, Michael, you've been in the macro scene quite a bit as well.
[39:21] And that's why I wanted you on this show. What would you have to say about some of these concerns that you're seeing roll across the
[39:30] screen? Well, it's not actually a gimmick, it's it doesn't touch the total supply cap, for one
[39:37] thing. So it's it's a temporary increase in emissions to be competitive against traditional finance
[39:46] rates. It's as simple as that we're not competitive with trade by yields right now.
[39:52] And those are not attractive against treasuries. I would add to that something I haven't mentioned yet.
[40:01] There's a lot of things I haven't mentioned yet. But one thing I haven't mentioned is the utter waste that we are sending to the mining allocation.
[40:12] Now I know that that's coming across pretty hard. And that's a strong opinion.
[40:17] But you prove to me that the coins that we're creating and sending to miners so that miners can operate loud, noisy machines, twiddling away, doing busy work on a number guessing
[40:32] game is adding any value to Dash beyond a minimal amount of security that's required to secure the network, which is almost completely obsolete with the masternode technologies
[40:44] that we've already innovated. So if there's any place that we need to cut emission in general, that's where it is.
[40:55] At a certain point, adding more hash power is not giving you extra security. And even even Dash Core Group, or at least Sam, the CTO of Dash Core Group, understands
[41:09] this. He shouldn't need to understand this because he's just writing code.
[41:14] This is an economics thing. But even like he understands this concept because he understands the mining security
[41:24] and what what mining is actually doing for us. Again, that's that's a huge topic that would take entire episodes to cover why why we have
[41:35] mining in the first place, what it's doing for us. But if your concern is that we're just creating too many more, too many coins and those coins
[41:43] that we're creating aren't adding value, that's the first place place to look. And you know, I in my previous career, I was an energy efficiency consultant trying to
[41:55] find industrial clients like paper machines and cement plants and things like that, trying to find energy savings and ways to increase their operational efficiency.
[42:09] And that's one of the one of the first things that you would look for is, OK, where's all the noise and where's all the heat?
[42:14] Well, that's basically what you get with mining, because that's where the inefficiency is. It's a kind of a small, trivial example, and it's not quite a perfect analogy, but there
[42:28] are there are a lot of ways that we could reduce our emissions by just cutting the mining. So that's that's one thing.
[42:36] And I know it's it's painful to some people because some people are running miners. But you know, miners are miners are they're just.
[42:47] What's the term? I'm forgetting the term, but basically, they're just they're just they're just around to to
[42:59] make a buck. Right.
[43:01] They're they're not really if you're a miner, you're not necessarily in it for for the long term of stability and security of this project necessarily.
[43:12] It's the holders of the coin you're looking for as mercenaries. Yes, exactly.
[43:18] They're just economic mercenaries. They will go to whatever makes them a buck and some marginal profitability.
[43:26] But unless you're actually holding the coin, like having it in your savings, and that's that's really where the people are actually providing security.
[43:41] And again, that's that's it's a topic that I'd be happy to debate with somebody if we'd like.
[43:47] But but it's the holders of the coin, and that's why you're saying, Michael, that we need to to give these people more of a yield because they're the ones that are taking the
[43:57] entire hit on their their coins, the thousand coins that they're holding. And they're seeing the value decrease.
[44:07] Well, they need to be compensated more because they're the ones that are actually providing the value in this network.
[44:14] It's the masternode owners that are actually holding the coins that are providing the value. Now, to the degree that miners mine the coins and then hold them, well, then, yes, to that
[44:26] degree, they're actually helping secure the network as well. And they should be then holding those coins that they've mined as masternode owners or
[44:37] at least partial masternode owners through service like Crowdnode. And then at that point, I'm praising them in their capacity of being masternode owners
[44:46] and holders of the coin, not in their capacity as being miners who just did a bunch of busy work with a machine to get those coins.
[44:58] It would have been better if they had just spun up a node and stopped their mining machines. Yes, that would decrease the hash rate, but we can we can we can decrease the hash rate
[45:09] and still be almost completely as secure, in fact, maybe entirely as secure as if they would have just.
[45:19] So if they would if they would turn off their miner, turn on a masternode or at least a partial masternode, they'd be securing the network even better, is what I'm trying to
[45:29] say. So let's see.
[45:33] One time says they aren't proposing a change to change the total supply. This is a proposal for masternode payouts to get an advance on future block rewards
[45:43] justified by the critical need of the bear market times. Yes, that's correct.
[45:48] But it's also not it's also not even just for bear market times. It's just the right thing to do in terms of efficiency.
[45:54] If you have if you have I always think back to my to my energy efficiency days, if you have a big 200 horsepower air compressor that's in a utility room and all of it, all that
[46:08] it's doing is blowing out into the atmosphere. It's using 200 horsepower of energy to compress air and then it's just blowing it out the
[46:18] roof that's doing absolutely nothing except for using electricity. You turn that thing off.
[46:25] And that's that's what we should do to most of the mining, not all of the mining at this point.
[46:30] I'm not even willing personally to do away with mining. I think that we just definitely need to decrease the allocation and put it towards masternode
[46:40] owners and or the treasury. And as I've proposed and as Foro has proposed, that needs to be an either or thing that those
[46:55] funds need to go either to the masternodes or if those masternodes think this person can provide value, then I will defer and divert my my payout to that proposal.
[47:12] And that's how it should be done. That's the right thing to do for Dash.
[47:16] And I'm pretty I'm fairly confident, well, I'm 100 percent confident that moving in that direction is the right is the right thing to do, not just because of bear market times.
[47:27] It would have been the right thing to do years and years ago when I first proposed it and when Foro was first proposing it.
[47:33] And I'm one of the first people that would be on the chopping block. So like my my total my job is is for Dash right now.
[47:42] And I'm even I am saying we need it to be harder to pass proposals by giving those unpassed proposals.
[47:52] Those funds go to the masternode owners. I'm trying to make it harder on myself and harder on any treasury proposal owner to get
[48:02] funding. That's what that's what increases the value of the Superblock.
[48:06] That's what increases the value of those coins. So Hlawe says some miners used to hold masternodes back in the day.
[48:13] Yeah, I think I covered that a little bit. I don't know if they still do now.
[48:16] And yet, to that degree, if they're holding masternodes, this is a concept that Evan had also collateralized mining.
[48:23] That's basically what you're saying is that some masternodes, some miners were actually holding coins.
[48:28] That's great. But turn the miner off and just be a masternode owner.
[48:35] So Michael, we're getting a little long here. So we're at 40 minutes.
[48:38] 48 minutes. Do you have any final thoughts on this?
[48:42] Well, just what we've discussed, just hitting the high points. There are potential drawbacks to doing any kind of tinkering, you know, to like emissions.
[49:02] But I just see more advantages right now in the market we're in. I see more advantages to just to step on the gas for a bit and then coast for a while.
[49:19] Then refactor, not doing anything against the hard cap that's been put in place. We've been sitting on our hands waiting for the market to just finally recognize that
[49:36] the dash is the greatest thing in the universe for a long time. That's not working.
[49:41] If you said to some engineers at NASA, you know, you're just tinkering around with fuel ratios and your rocket engines.
[49:52] What is that doing? Like, you're just tinkering around.
[49:54] Well, yeah, of course. You're trying to figure out a way to success.
[50:00] It's not going to build itself. You can't just you can't just expect to have your economic design perfect because one person
[50:11] seven years ago decided on a supply schedule allocation and then be done. And that was perfect.
[50:19] We don't we don't we're not we don't have it perfect. We're far from perfect.
[50:24] And we need to if you want to use the word tinker, we need to try some things because what we've been doing, which is not trying a lot of things that hasn't been working.
[50:38] So anyway, I think I'll close it out there. I know this was a controversial episode, but that's what, you know, sometimes sometimes
[50:52] I'm not going to call myself a leader, but sometimes people just need to speak the truth. And this is the truth that we are wasting way too much money in mining.
[51:03] It would be much better used as for increasing the yield on masternode owners. We can improve a lot of things about how the opportunity costs in the superblock treasury
[51:16] system by making funds come from the masternode owners that will increase the value and the proposal system.
[51:25] What else? Increase temporarily increasing the block rewards.
[51:29] It may be that may be exactly what we need to do, because defunding core group, defunding that incubator and basically or at least significantly reducing the staff there is just a terrible
[51:47] idea when you have a bunch of miners that are not that are not only not adding value to the system, they're actively decreasing the value of the system because they're constantly
[52:00] selling coins to utility companies for their to pay for their electricity. How does that help us?
[52:08] How does that help us? You tell me it doesn't.
[52:12] So I'm a little pissed about the community actually in a lot of ways, because trust me, I know what you know about Austrian economics and a lot more.
[52:25] I've read the books, I've read all the books, I've read Rothbard, I've read Mises. I know what they're talking about with increasing money supply and having a certain money supply.
[52:37] It is a good foundation to have and to and to understand. But you need to balance that with other aspects of of economics like, well, even saying the
[52:49] term will be too controversial, but there are definitely ways where produce creating coins does actually increase value.
[52:59] And if you don't believe that, then you don't know anything about how corporations work, because corporations have they do the same thing.
[53:07] They issue stock, they issue shares and equity in their company, and that's used as an incentive to build a corporation.
[53:17] And then. The funds that go into that equity and the manpower, the labor, the engineers, the whatever
[53:27] your your staff, a lot of those people work for equity shares that were created out of nothing.
[53:35] And they do that because it actually does increase. Like if you put the if you put those shares, if you put your labor force to good use, then
[53:46] the value of your equity goes up. And this is exactly how this is.
[53:51] This is very similar to how it works with creating new currencies. Again, I've thought about it a lot, probably more than that.
[54:00] Most people have. So I'm asking for some trust to at least explore this, these options.
[54:07] And I'll wrap it up there. And one last one last chance to say anything left, Michael, and then we'll close it out.
[54:17] Yeah. Yeah.
[54:19] I think we've pretty much covered everything. I just I just think we do have a low enough percentage of our target supply that afford
[54:33] to step on the gas for a bit to get us through this high rate environment that we find ourselves in.
[54:41] And we're not touching total supply where we're just increasing and then we're just fine.
[54:54] Because rates will come down in traditional finance eventually. It's just something that they find themselves in the situation that traditional finance
[55:07] of having to increase yields themselves. And I think people are looking at what the stock market's doing in the price equity ratios
[55:16] more and more now. They're not relying solely on growth to be their decision make primary decision maker
[55:27] when investing in an asset. They're looking for yield right now.
[55:32] And I would like to see Dash be competitive in that field. So that's basically all I have to say.
[55:46] All right. We'll leave it there.
[55:48] Thanks, everybody, for tuning in. It's been a long episode and appreciate everybody's attention and watching this both live and
[55:56] in the future. So feel free to ping me in Discord.
[56:00] This is my username right there. If you have any questions or concerns, we'll hammer it out in the public Discord.
[56:07] So thanks, everybody, again. And we'll see you later.
