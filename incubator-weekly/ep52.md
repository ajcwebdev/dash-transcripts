[00:00] (upbeat music) - Massive bad steepening.
[00:12] The thing that we've been worried about is finally here. So we have the potential effects of deflationary money.
[00:19] This is not about Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. It's not strictly about those.
[00:25] It's about systemic concerns that go beyond them. (upbeat music)
[00:31] We see this non-predictable, non-cyclical, tenuous sort of a nature occurring with the money supply.
[00:40] We may need to ask what is causing that? Is it the market or is it the state?
[00:45] We need more freedom. We need more banks interacting in the market freely
[00:51] by their own volition, taking deposits, making loans freely, able to fail by the way freely.
[00:58] Imagine where we would have been here if we had just had let all the bad actors fail
[01:03] in the global financial crisis instead of intervening. The reason that there's this tension in the economy
[01:08] is not because of the market itself. It's not because of fractional reserve banking.
[01:12] It's not because of free banking. It's because there's a monopolistic issuer in the society
[01:17] and that is the central bank. - We don't want a bank.
[01:25] We want a bank vault. Consumers do not want their deposits
[01:31] to be used for shenanigans. Should there be a service that provides no interest
[01:37] but is just a custodian of money that is absolutely protected,
[01:42] where is the bank vault product in the world? Does it exist?
[01:45] 'Cause I can't seem to find it. What would you pay for that?
[01:47] 'Cause right now we're basically giving every crypto entrepreneur at Zealot,
[01:52] you know, basically the high ground 'cause they could make this product.
[01:55] - Central banks say they have tools, say they're going to deploy those tools,
[02:00] but those tools never seem to produce the desired result. - I mean, why don't we just have one central bank
[02:09] controlling all the money in the entire world, right? As Cain said, the bank core.
[02:14] Or we could have free market money that can't be controlled by any one bank,
[02:20] any one government, any one individual, any one government, any one individual.
[02:25] - Hello, welcome to Incubator Weekly. Today I'm joined as always by my co-host, Ryan.
[02:43] How are you today, Ryan? - Doing great up here in a snowy Heber City, Utah.
[02:48] - Right on, right on. Well, and we have someone with us today
[02:51] who is not in the snow, though he almost was recently. This is a newcomer to the incubator
[02:58] and wallet designer, Nick Brunson. How are you today, Nick?
[03:03] - I'm great, how are you? - I'm great, thanks for asking.
[03:07] Might be the first time I've been asked that on this. So yeah, we are pumped today at the incubator
[03:14] to be talking about something that is, I mean, is it a first for us, Ryan?
[03:18] Like a wallet, a brand new wallet? - I guess it depends what we mean by wallet,
[03:23] but we've had different wallet type products, but this is gonna be the first wallet
[03:32] that we have as like a desktop, more traditional, almost replacement
[03:38] for the Dash Core wallet, or at least a substitute for it.
[03:43] Not a full blockchain wallet, but light wallet. - Right, okay, well, let's start, I guess,
[03:52] from the beginnings of this wallet, which in this case is the design.
[03:57] And Nick, we want to hear a bit about your background, you know, professionally.
[04:02] - Sure, yeah, I've been a UI/UX designer for a little over 15 years.
[04:10] I grew up in Utah, I was born and raised in Utah, and worked there for most of my career,
[04:14] and yeah, another one. (laughs) And worked for a few years in Silicon Valley,
[04:19] and kind of bounced back and forth, and then made my way out to Los Angeles
[04:23] about four years ago. And I've been working mostly
[04:26] as a freelance UI/UX designer out here since then, so. - Okay, and when did you hear, I guess, first about,
[04:34] assuming Dash wasn't the first cryptocurrency you heard about, unless it was,
[04:39] when did you first hear about crypto and how? - I mean, I heard of crypto, honestly,
[04:45] back when I lived in Silicon Valley in the, like, 2012, 2013 era, you know,
[04:50] people were talking about it, but I just didn't know much about it,
[04:53] which, obviously, like most people, wished I would've paid more attention back then.
[04:57] But, you know, then, kind of over the years, learned a little bit more about it,
[05:03] but I've always just kind of casually paid attention, and every now and again, I'll, you know,
[05:08] bought a few coins. But I learned of Dash through a friend, AJ,
[05:14] who's also on the Dash Incubator, who introduced me to the group
[05:20] and told me about the projects and kind of, he and I have chatted about it a few times
[05:25] over the last little while, and then recently kind of brought me along
[05:29] and brought me into the crew. - Okay.
[05:33] So then, fellas, where did the idea for this wallet even come about?
[05:37] - So, we've been talking about, I've been talking about this with AJ for a while.
[05:48] So it's been kind of in our minds for quite some time about, you know, should we do a wallet, should we not?
[05:55] And we decided a while ago that the first step towards that
[06:03] would be building just wallet tools, so that we have all the primitives ready
[06:09] so that we can build a nice, clean, lightweight, and functional wallet eventually.
[06:18] And now that we've got those tools for the most part done,
[06:23] we figured it was time to actually put a UI on top and go with building a wallet.
[06:31] So AJ, obviously that's the connection with Nick, and I'm meeting Nick for the first time on screen here.
[06:40] We've talked over voice, but it's the first time I'm kind of meeting him
[06:45] in visual format. But I wanted to have Nick on as our guest for this
[06:53] because UI and UX, and by that I mean user interface and the user experience,
[07:04] is such a big part of cryptocurrency in general. And obviously a wallet is really dependent
[07:13] on the UI and the UX. And so I wanted to get a designer on
[07:19] just to have us kind of know what goes into that process, why it's important.
[07:27] And I think you've got some questions to drill down on that, but I think a lot of times we aren't as focused
[07:36] on the user experience as we should be, because that's really where it meets our customers.
[07:43] We can have the most functional products that we can, we can have instant confirmations,
[07:48] and we can have high security, and great tokenomics and everything like that in Dash,
[07:56] but unless we have a great user experience, it's just not going to reach the masses.
[08:02] - So I just have a question based on what you've just said, Ryan, and do forgive me,
[08:09] this wasn't in the question list that I ran by you fellas, but that prompts me to ask you,
[08:14] Nick, what is your impression of wallets in the crypto space in general right now?
[08:21] Like, what do you think is, I mean, is anything very good? Is anything very terrible?
[08:27] Like when you're coming to the space, what's the mind frame you're coming with?
[08:32] - Yeah, it's interesting you ask, 'cause part of this process as I've gotten started
[08:38] with Ryan and AJ and the team was to do a little bit of what we call discovery,
[08:44] where we'll kind of go and look at the market and see what's out there and help me get some research
[08:50] and understand a bit about just the crypto world in general, 'cause I'm a bit new to it.
[08:56] And so, yeah, during that process, we actually looked through a lot of the different wallets
[09:00] that are out there and kind of some of the products that are out there.
[09:04] You know, my general sense is that there are a lot, there are a lot of different wallets that exist out there
[09:10] and many of them are sort of, you know, don't have much thought or design thinking behind them.
[09:18] And then there are a few that are pretty good that are sort of kind of the bigger names
[09:22] that have pretty decent design and user experience, you know, like Coinbase being one of them, Robinhood.
[09:34] Those are kind of some of the bigger ones that seem to obviously put a lot of design
[09:39] and thought into the user experience. But there are a lot of really good tokens and coins
[09:46] out there that don't necessarily make it on those platforms or have a hard time sort of competing
[09:53] or getting exposure in some of those places. So it's kind of an interesting space right now
[09:58] for me to be learning about, I guess. - Right, okay, so let's talk a little bit about,
[10:06] I guess, just why is there need for this wallet, Ryan? Like you said, you thought that it could serve
[10:14] as a sort of substitute, though not a full blockchain substitute
[10:18] for the Dash Core desktop wallet. What do you think can be brought by this wallet
[10:26] that we don't already have? - And as you asked that question,
[10:32] I see a comment from a girl named Rachel Rawson, who actually happens to be my wife.
[10:39] Her name's not updated on that profile apparently, but. - That's the name she uses online
[10:46] that you don't know about. It doesn't have your last name on it, Ryan.
[10:49] - Yeah, exactly. And as it says in this comment here,
[10:53] she does all the heavy lifting in our household as far as like spending Dash and using Dash.
[10:59] And I do hear some complaints every now and then, like why is this wallet re-syncing again?
[11:05] Why is it not sending my transaction? So cryptocurrency, it's a hard space.
[11:13] So I understand there's challenges and no disrespect to the builders of existing wallets
[11:21] on the market right now. But I felt like we needed to have something
[11:26] that we kind of controlled as far as the performance and like syncing issues.
[11:34] I've had syncing issues forever with the Dash iOS wallet. And although we're not targeting mobile specifically
[11:43] as our first phase, I've had different experiences with desktop wallets as well.
[11:50] But beyond that, there's also a lot of integrations. Like recently we've had on the Maya guys
[12:00] where you can have instant exchanges between cryptocurrencies within wallets
[12:08] or providing liquidity on those platforms and earning a yield.
[12:13] And obviously we don't have any Maya integrations in any of our wallets yet because it's not live yet,
[12:21] but it will be live pretty soon. Actually, probably within a month,
[12:25] we will be able to have that opportunity to be integrated with Maya.
[12:31] But I'm not sure if we have any plans for our other wallets to integrate with Maya,
[12:38] but we certainly would at some point. And while we're keeping our scope limited
[12:43] in our first iterations and we won't have that Maya integration,
[12:47] that is something that we will have the ability to do very quickly when that happens.
[12:53] And so that's one of the other reasons is to be able to make integrations very quick
[12:59] and something that we control personally or as an organization.
[13:04] So that's part of it as well. - I'm not sure if I answered your question, but...
[13:12] - Yes, you did. So let's talk just a little bit
[13:18] about the sort of at time of launch features that can be expected from this wallet.
[13:25] So we already said Lite client, so it doesn't require full blockchain download.
[13:31] And there were a few other features and let's just cover those.
[13:36] I believe the main thing is XPUB contacts. That's the main technical term.
[13:42] I don't even like to use these terms, but I know that maybe there's not a better one.
[13:47] But will one of you give us just like a general overview of like, what does it mean
[13:51] that the wallet will have XPUB contacts and support hierarchical deterministic?
[13:56] What does that mean? - Well, I'll start that answer.
[13:59] And I would like Nick to give his feedback on this as well. After I go over the foundation.
[14:08] XPUBs is extended public keys. And it's the basis of being able to share multiple addresses
[14:17] with contacts that you make. And it's the basis obviously for our DashPay project
[14:24] that's been going on for several years. And what we've decided is that we can get XPUB contacts
[14:31] that we can get, I don't wanna put a percentage on it, but we can get a high percentage of the experience
[14:42] of what DashPay is going to offer with the friending process and whatnot.
[14:48] But without having the huge overhead of the DashPay contract and everything
[14:57] and having to wait for platform to get on main net, just using extended public keys alone
[15:04] and exchanging those and being able to name contacts and have that be a focal point of the wallet experience
[15:13] of just kind of like Venmo and like PayPal. Actually, I don't even think that they do it very well,
[15:20] but have the friending and the contacts experience upfront and a focal point of the wallet.
[15:29] And you can do that with just extended public keys. And so we've got the libraries to be able to do that.
[15:34] Nick doesn't have to worry about that obviously in terms of the blockchain internals,
[15:41] but he'll be focusing on that as part of the user experience.
[15:47] So the friend contact requests, and this is something that I think
[15:55] that we could have had a long time ago, but we went very far
[16:00] and like ended up building a whole separate blockchain, but we could have probably done this many, many years ago,
[16:08] just having exchanging public keys as friend requests. So that will be another feature of the wallet.
[16:15] And then later at a later time, when platform is done,
[16:20] we can just upgrade people to have these globally unique registered usernames on blockchain.
[16:27] So we can morph into that when it's ready. - Simple enough.
[16:32] Okay, so as you had said there, oh yes, I wanted to ask just a little bit about cost.
[16:47] As you had mentioned, Ryan, the tools that Nick primarily needs to build this wallet
[16:56] have been built in a former incubator project that we covered several weeks ago
[17:03] with developer AJ called the Payment Tools Project. So does that mean that the majority of the costs are covered
[17:12] or like what do you expect things will cost in total going forward?
[17:17] And how would that compare to maybe what other wallets you may have heard of might cost?
[17:24] - I actually have no idea about where it's going to end up as far as costs go, but I will say one thing,
[17:30] like we have done a lot of the internal tooling already. But again, another reason that Nick is here as our guest
[17:40] is that I wanted to make it explicit that design and user experience is a very focal point of this wallet.
[17:48] And so while we do have a lot of the internal tooling already built and the costs are already absorbed there,
[17:59] we do want to spend some significant portion of time and effort into building the design.
[18:08] And specifically Nick is an asset here because he's not very familiar with cryptocurrency.
[18:15] I wanted to have somebody, well, actually it's not like I went out
[18:20] and I selected somebody. AJ kind of brought Nick into the project
[18:24] and I thought it was, I just happened to think it was great that he,
[18:28] he's not one of us yet as far as like in the inside group of Dash.
[18:33] And like, that's a feature not a- - Not a bug.
[18:39] - Not a bug, yeah. So as far as like the incubator goes though,
[18:45] one of the nice things about just our structure in general is that everything is exactly accounted for.
[18:52] So you will know real time how much we're putting into the wallet,
[18:59] both from the design perspective and the coding perspective.
[19:03] And so anybody who's interested in knowing how much it costs,
[19:07] they'll know exactly down to the Dash or Duff what we put into this.
[19:13] - So then Nick, with your not yet being a lemming, would you share with us a bit about the research process
[19:24] that you have gone through in order to come up with your initial design plans?
[19:29] - Sure, absolutely. So like I had mentioned before,
[19:33] what I like to do usually, especially with any new project,
[19:37] but especially with one like this where, like you said, I'm sort of new to the crypto world.
[19:42] I'm not fully initiated yet. I'm what I would consider myself
[19:46] like kind of a casual observer. We like to do a phase called discovery,
[19:51] which is essentially just a research phase where I take some time and some inputs from the team
[19:57] about kind of where to look and what to read. And so we did that.
[20:01] The team sent me some links and some places to look and some ideas to kind of spend some time on.
[20:09] And then what I did is just kind of went out and read through a lot of the documentation
[20:14] and looked at a lot of the competitors and looked at some of the other Dash wallets that exist
[20:20] and some of those types of things. And so you can see here what you're sharing
[20:24] is just sort of a bit of my notes and a bit of a live sort of document
[20:31] that was just a place for me to capture some of these thoughts and share it with the team
[20:35] as I went through this process. So you can kind of see here that,
[20:40] just went and learned a little bit about Dash in general and even some of the more technical things,
[20:44] which a lot of this was kind of over my head. And then, as I worked from left to right here,
[20:51] I went and researched some of the existing Dash wallets, both web and mobile, and even some of the desktop ones
[20:59] where you actually have to download the desktop app. I won't go too deep into each of these,
[21:06] but then sort of working my way towards some of the more well-known things
[21:12] and a little bit of the larger sort of platforms that are out there that exist.
[21:16] Again, I mentioned Coinbase, I think, before. And then even all the way out to just looking at
[21:21] some of the general finance apps that exist in the world. As Ryan was talking about Xpub and Contacts
[21:28] and some of those things, he was mentioning things that are new to me
[21:31] that I am learning even as he talks. And so it's great to kind of learn a little bit about that
[21:38] and kind of get an idea of how we're gonna move forward with designing a solution
[21:44] that feels a little more open to everyone and something that, again,
[21:50] you don't have to be quite as initiated to interact with. And I think the contacts thing
[21:55] is definitely one of those sticky points. People tend to get a little nervous
[21:59] when you have to copy and paste a 70-digit hash code or something into the wallet address.
[22:07] I think that makes the normal user a little bit nervous. So those are some of the things that we're learning about
[22:14] and trying to get an idea of kind of how we can move forward and design some cleaner, simpler solutions for people.
[22:20] - Got it. - Yeah.
[22:23] - I wanted to say one thing before I forget. Another side purpose of this is to also,
[22:31] how do I say it? Create some competition and some education
[22:38] as far as Dash development goes. So if you looked at the project card
[22:45] for this specific project, you'd see it's named something like vanilla,
[22:51] vanilla- - Vanilla Web Wallet. - Vanilla Web Wallet.
[22:54] Yeah. - Yeah. - And the reason that vanilla is in there
[22:56] is because we are building this wallet. We're building it without a JavaScript framework.
[23:04] We're building it in JavaScript. And we're most likely going to use
[23:09] a framework wrapper called Tori, which is a Rust.
[23:17] It's a program that allows you to create desktop, cross-platform desktop wallets using HTML, JavaScript, CSS,
[23:31] but also Rust if and when you need it to create the actual executable for your binary
[23:41] that would actually run on your platform. So the desktop app, it's a desktop app.
[23:45] So if anybody has heard of Electron, it's very similar to Electron
[23:50] in that it creates a cross-platform. - Electron? - Electron,
[23:55] which is different than Electrum. So Electrum is a, I believe it's a Python web wallet,
[24:04] or not web wallet, but desktop wallet. And that's totally different.
[24:08] That's a desktop wallet written in Python. Electron is a technology that's used to,
[24:17] where you write HTML, JavaScript, CSS, web app, but then you wrap it in this container
[24:27] that makes it, instead of running just on the web, you can run it on as a desktop wallet
[24:31] or even a mobile wallet, I believe. And that's called Electron.
[24:36] And it's been around for a long time, but Tari is something very similar to Electron,
[24:42] but instead of, I don't know what Electron is written in, but it's kind of old and dated.
[24:48] It's got some cruft and some technical debt in it. And Tari is kind of like the new latest greatest
[24:56] built-in Rust application framework so that you can build your applications.
[25:02] And you can build them in just vanilla JavaScript, but you can also build them using a framework
[25:08] like React or Vue or Svelte or Solid. And so we're initially going to be doing
[25:16] the vanilla version, more or less, as a reference application.
[25:23] And then so that anybody who has JavaScript experience can look at this and see,
[25:29] this is how you build a Dash wallet in JavaScript. And it's very simple.
[25:36] You can put it in this Tori wrapper, and then now you've got a desktop app,
[25:40] but then other people can kind of take a look at that and see this is how the libraries are used.
[25:45] And I wanna do that in React, or I wanna do that in Solid.
[25:48] So as developers come into the incubator that might be more interested in,
[25:53] developers are kind of tribal in that sense that once you're a React developer,
[26:00] you just love React and everything that you wanna build has to be in React or Solid.
[26:06] Same thing, Svelte and Vue. So we can kind of take this application,
[26:11] as you use it as a reference, so that anybody who wants to build a wallet
[26:16] that's in one of these other frameworks, they can use this as a reference.
[26:23] So I guess that kind of fits in with my broader view of cryptocurrency and Dash in general,
[26:33] in that we're moving into a world where we have a new financial system,
[26:40] and we need to have lots of different wallets and lots of different developers building
[26:47] and competing to create the best experiences. And we're just getting started.
[26:52] So we need to have great solutions. And yeah, we need to have a lot of different wallets,
[27:01] I think, instead of just relying on one team with one wallet, we need to broaden that out a little bit.
[27:09] - Got it. So my final question that could apply to either of you
[27:16] is if you, I'm assuming that you're feeling pretty good on the talent front,
[27:25] as far as what's required to complete this wallet, but if you weren't,
[27:29] if there were like one dream person out there, if you were gonna send you a Discord message,
[27:35] today or tomorrow being like, this is what I could bring to this project,
[27:38] are you interested? Who would that person be?
[27:42] Like, is there anything in your dreams that remains to see this project be even better?
[27:50] - Um, not exactly. Like I just said about the different framework developers,
[27:58] I would like to have some more like experts in different frameworks come in and say,
[28:05] hey, I don't need a lot of guidance. I can see this reference application,
[28:12] and I think I could do it 10 times better, 10 times faster at a 10th of the cost.
[28:18] You know, obviously those numbers are inflated, but some developers are just awesome.
[28:24] And if they are watching this or they hear about this and they, you know, our accounting's open,
[28:31] they can see like, hey, I can build what you guys are building.
[28:37] Like, I'm way better, essentially. Then yeah, come in and join us.
[28:44] We have room, we have some funds to work with, specifically for top-tier developers
[28:52] that don't need a lot of hand-holding, mostly like entrepreneurial developers.
[28:57] Just come with your own idea and don't necessarily ask to be like, what can I do?
[29:04] But just come with your own idea and tell me what you wanna do.
[29:11] Tell one of us, one of us strategists, what you think is great, and then we'll see if it works.
[29:18] - Okay. - Yeah. - Please, Nick.
[29:23] - Oh, I was just gonna say, I don't have a good answer for that.
[29:27] I just started with the team and so far they've been great. So, you know, no complaints, but you know,
[29:34] I agree with Ryan anytime anyone of top talent, even if there are more designers that could come join in,
[29:39] that'd be great too. So it's always fun to work with more people
[29:43] and have additional views and ideas, like you said. So yeah, I agree.
[29:50] - Yeah, and just coming in with an attitude of like, I see a problem, I see an opportunity,
[29:59] and I know how to fix it. That's the best thing that we can get.
[30:03] And yeah, Nick and I haven't worked together well, or not together long at all.
[30:09] And so it'll be, so I guess this is kind of like a dialogue for Nick as well.
[30:15] Like, just kind of look at the opportunities, look at the space, see what you see as opportunities
[30:22] that we're lacking and just kind of run with it. And we'll stop you if we need to,
[30:28] but just take the initiative. - Righteous. - You might have to stop me.
[30:34] - Yeah, good, good. - That would be a high quality problem to have, no?
[30:39] Like Nick is obese, someone please stop him. - Someone stop him.
[30:43] - Good. Okay, well, that is Incubator Weekly for this week.
[30:49] So we look forward to updating you more on this particular project in the future.
[30:55] And yeah, we'll have a new and different topic for you next week and look forward to seeing you then.
[31:02] - Okay, see you guys. Thanks. - Sorry I'm late.
[31:05] - Thanks for having me. Yep. - Welcome.
[31:07] - Thanks, Nick, bye. - Bye-bye.
