[00:00] [ Music ] >> Jill and her team looked at their own customer transactions
[00:09] and discovered an increasing number of customers moving funds to alternative payment services,
[00:14] such as digital wallets and mobile payment apps. This corresponded with a noticeable decline
[00:20] in customers' deposits and accounts at Community Bank. They knew they had to take action.
[00:26] [ Music ] >> Today, people and businesses expect to make
[00:34] and receive payments at the click of a button any time of the day, every day of the year, including account
[00:40] to account transfers, bill pay, and person-to-person transactions.
[00:45] The FedNow service will be here in 2023. Will you be ready?

[03:15] >> Hello, everyone. Welcome to Incubator Weekly.
[03:20] I am Amanda, and I'm joined, as always, by my trusty co-host, Ryan.
[03:24] Hello today, Ryan. >> Howdy, everyone.
[03:28] >> Hi. And our guest today is a fellow strategist within the Incubator, and you know him already as Ash Francis.
[03:37] Hi, Ash. >> Hey.
[03:39] >> So today, we're showing you something that we've not shown before, which is a game,
[03:44] a game that the Incubator built. So without much further ado, what is this game, really, Ash,
[03:52] and where did the idea for it even come from? >> Yeah. So probably about, oh, well, maybe even two years now,
[04:00] me and Alex and I were feeling sort of burnt out with a lot, well, a year ago, a lot of blockchain work
[04:07] and a lot of heavy, you know, compliance work on my end. Alex was just doing a lot of work on just hard,
[04:13] hardcore programming, and just -- >> And Alex. Remind us who Alex is.
[04:18] >> Yeah. So Alex is my co-founder. He's mostly the genius that does all the hard development work.
[04:24] I do some of the easier stuff, but he has been working with Dash since 2017, just as long as I have,
[04:32] but he's the wizard behind the curtain to a degree, whereas I'm more of the face of everything that we're doing.
[04:40] And, yeah, Alex is just a very talented developer, and he built the Maya integration prior to that.
[04:47] It was a Thor chain integration. So, yeah, about a year ago, we were feeling
[04:51] we wanted to do something somewhat different, but we were also seeing a lot of news about blockchain gaming.
[04:56] We spoke to some guy from a studio called Chibli Games who was building some blockchain games,
[05:04] and we'd seen Lightbringer as well that was adding all sorts of transactions and value to Litecoin.
[05:10] So we got thinking about how we could build a game using Dash. Obviously, Dash Platform was still on the horizon,
[05:17] as it has been for a while, and we wanted to take that and turn it into something, but we wanted to be original.
[05:24] So we started brainstorming some ideas. We drew on our whiteboard in the office a grid to play on.
[05:33] We printed out paper cards, and we just started game theory sort of testing.
[05:39] Our initial idea was an RNG-based game where you have your main character,
[05:45] and that can summon other monsters and creatures to help it in its mission to defeat the other player's character.
[05:53] It's a 1v1 head-to-head game. And unfortunately, the RNG element that you might summon
[06:00] or you might fail, that didn't prove that great gameplay-wise, so we moved to more of an energy structure.
[06:07] So yeah, we got started. We got dug in and started building all that out.
[06:12] Now it's at a playable state, and the next step is to really dashify everything,
[06:18] as well as build out a library and documentation for other game developers to very easily integrate
[06:25] Dash and Dash Platform into their games and into their processes and plays.
[06:31] Well, ding! Well, I was going to ask to see the demo a bit later, but now I just want to see it now. Can we watch it now?
[06:37] Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, let's get that going. Okay, so this is Summoners.
[06:42] As you can see, we have a hexagonal grid, and again, it's a turn-based strategy.
[06:46] On the left, we have Player 0, and on the right, Player 1. Some useful information is at the top here,
[06:51] including which player you are, whose turn it is, and how much energy you have,
[06:55] and how much energy you are adding per turn. You gain an extra energy per turn if you have a unit or your summoner
[07:00] on the green dotted tiles, and an extra 2 energy per turn if you have the pink tile captured.
[07:05] On the left here, you can see my deck. In the future, this will be hidden,
[07:09] and just below, you can see 5 creatures in my hand. Energy is the resource used to summon these down,
[07:14] to help you in the objective of defeating the enemy summoner whilst protecting your own.
[07:19] Okay, let's get started. As you can see, I've moved my summoner over
[07:23] and brought down some Burning Spears, which cost me 1 energy, which you can see
[07:27] from the number at the top right of the tile. You can also see the stats on this tile.
[07:31] It has 2 attack, 1 health, and 1 movement speed. As you can see, a card from my deck
[07:36] has been randomly brought into my hand following this, and I'm ready to end my turn.
[07:41] Okay, so the opponent has unfortunately not been able to summon on their first turn,
[07:45] because they don't have a 1-cost card. We're thinking of giving the second player an extra energy,
[07:49] or to allow their first summon unit the ability to move and attack right away.
[07:53] Game balance will come further down the line. Alright, let's keep moving and fast-forward
[07:57] through the rest of this game, and see how it plays out. One of the interesting bits, which I highlight here,
[08:03] is direction. Combat is one-directional, so rather than both units head-butting each other
[08:09] at the same time, it's more of a three-way combat.
[08:13] So, if the opponent is going to attack, it's going to be one-directional.
[08:17] If the opponent is going to attack, it's going to be two-directional.
[08:21] If the opponent is going to attack, it's going to be one-directional.
[08:25] If the opponent is going to attack, and they're guarding each other at the same time,
[08:29] it's just the first person to attack, whoever's turn it is,
[08:33] that unit does its damage. We experimented with a staggered approach,
[08:37] and with more sort of, you know, they both hit each other,
[08:41] or once they take turns, but we found this added the most novel gameplay,
[08:45] because you can bring down a unit, attack, and then retreat,
[08:49] or however you wanted to approach that. You'll see here, this game is definitely
[08:55] going in my favour at the moment, with three units on the board,
[08:59] and I think it finishes just after this, and we're given with a brief summary
[09:03] of the outcome of the game at the end. Okay.
[09:11] Here you go. So, similar to chess in a way,
[09:15] you have your units on the board, you've got to defeat the opponent's king,
[09:19] but this, you bring down the units, you can move around the table,
[09:23] different units have different mobilities, and yeah, it's, you know,
[09:27] obviously visual-wise, it is quite basic where it's at right now,
[09:31] the goal is not, you know, the design side of stuff at the moment,
[09:35] that's the next stage, we're actually in talks with a technical artist
[09:39] to turn those assets, and take the game from being a top-down,
[09:43] very, you know, basic visual game to almost a 3D game,
[09:47] somewhere between 2D and 3D, where it's kind of like an isometric perspective,
[09:51] which is called 2.5D, and that will be to turn that game
[09:55] into a very visual production. Huh.
[09:59] When you mentioned your initial, I guess, physical world playtesting,
[10:03] I wanted to show this image that I had found. Ah, yes.
[10:07] There we go. I don't know if everybody can see that.
[10:11] Yeah, definitely. So, yeah, early days,
[10:15] just printing out paper with, you know, those are the energy cards and the table and the board,
[10:19] so you can see how the game's progressed into an actual real game.
[10:23] From that first physical game,
[10:27] we built a web game, so it was just built in HTML5
[10:31] using Canvas with TypeScript, JavaScript,
[10:35] and then from there we've taken it to Unity, so now that it's in Unity,
[10:39] the key thing is building out that whole library for
[10:43] the use of Dash ecosystem, but it's a fun game, our friends have playtested it,
[10:47] we've spent, you know, hours playing it, there's still going to be balance
[10:51] and there's going to be new cards with different factions
[10:55] and right now the cards, for example, when you summon them down, they can't
[10:59] move until their next turn. We're going to add ones where they can move quickly
[11:03] or even when you summon them down, it does an area of effect damage or, you know,
[11:07] however it is, so there's going to be all sorts of features down the line.
[11:11] Okay. Well, going more in the thread of development,
[11:15] so we're not feature complete yet, as you've just
[11:19] said, and so I wanted to clarify,
[11:23] this was something that you had mentioned just this morning with regard to the title of the video.
[11:27] Is this game currently using Dash
[11:31] L1 or Platform Testnet? So right now
[11:35] the game isn't using Platform or Layer
[11:39] 1. We have done some experiments with using Layer 1 for
[11:43] random number generation. In fact, that was a game that we built previously, but we can
[11:47] cover that more in a very basic game where we use Dash transaction
[11:51] signatures, which after discussion with Dash Core Group, they were
[11:55] considered fair entropy,
[11:59] completely random data that we could rely on for seeding a
[12:03] random number generator, and that'll be part of this, you know, throughout
[12:07] hundreds of different games, thousands
[12:11] of different games, random number generation, whether that's drawing a random
[12:15] card from a deck in, let's say, a gambler game like poker, or
[12:19] in our case, the unit, or, you know, the damage a unit
[12:23] does if that is a varied, you know, between a certain amount
[12:27] and another, you need random number generation and especially when it comes
[12:31] to e-gaming, so poker or slots or however, it
[12:35] has to be fair, and there's this whole concept of provably
[12:39] fair where if someone can say, you know, this
[12:43] machine, I mean, there's huge, like, legal structures
[12:47] for this in the States, but if you could do this online in a way, and there are
[12:51] companies doing this where you can show that that number has
[12:55] been provably fairly generated and then odds aren't being manipulated,
[12:59] you know, people worry about machines saying, oh, you know, that machine
[13:03] will only pay out once it's had, you know, 100,000 in it, and then it'll pay out
[13:07] 50,000 or whatever it is, but there was a win on there last week,
[13:11] so I'm not going to play on that, you know, whereas if you can show that every
[13:15] role, every card draw, everything is completely
[13:19] fair, that's novel and that's good, and if you can do that
[13:23] in a way where it's cheap and effective and on the blockchain and fully
[13:27] transparent, that's powerful. - So does the random number
[13:31] generation using L1 come from blocks being found?
[13:35] - No, it comes from the transaction signatures, from the
[13:39] actual instance transaction being locked, so it's the work done
[13:43] by the Mars Node Quorum, if I'm not mistaken, to
[13:47] sort of, yeah, validate and lock that transaction.
[13:51] So it's a BL sig, I think. So yeah, it's
[13:55] part of Dash, really. It's, yeah, it's not
[13:59] just in every other crypto's transactions, it's something that's specific to
[14:03] Dash. - Okay, so then beyond random number generation on L1,
[14:07] where does the platform component come in? - Oh, it's, you know,
[14:11] obviously, how long's a piece of string? Ultimately, platform is, again,
[14:15] a very open-ended product and when it comes to gaming, that
[14:19] product could have hundreds of use cases. Obviously, you know,
[14:23] there's the economy side of things, whether that is you're building and releasing NFTs
[14:27] on Dash platform that are cross-game or cross-universe or even cross-studio.
[14:31] You know, if I could take my items from Fortnite and bring them into
[14:35] Counter-Strike or my identity, my avatar, if I could have
[14:39] my whole, sort of, economy and game state, even whether
[14:43] you know, in the case of Summoners, each move that's
[14:47] done on a state game where users bet against each other,
[14:51] we haven't spoken about that, so we should speak about that. - Yes. - Yes, that can be
[14:55] stored on Dash platform, so everything can be seen historically
[14:59] as a record of data and even just using Dash platform
[15:03] as an effective part of their back-end, you know, you probably still
[15:07] need some level of game servers for other aspects of the game, but if
[15:11] you can mitigate your need for that and just use Dash platform as
[15:15] that database or even in the future when data contracts have more
[15:19] features as part of the game logic, you can just outsource that
[15:23] and you know it's a reliable, bulletproof network hosted all around the world
[15:27] you know, on 2000 whatever it is, high-performance mass nodes,
[15:31] whatever it ends up being, you can be confident in the reliability,
[15:35] the availability of that data, the transparency,
[15:39] it's just, you know, the possibilities are endless, really, when it comes to
[15:43] using it. - So I remember reading in the initial
[15:47] specification of this game that the first feature
[15:51] intended to be added after what we've seen demoed is the ability
[15:55] to wager on the outcome of a game. Is that something that can be done on L1
[15:59] or does that require platform to be done? - It can be done
[16:03] on L1, but it requires platform to be beautiful and seamless.
[16:07] So on Layer 1, we can do this thing called, well,
[16:11] escrow to a degree, but reality is there's a concept called
[16:15] MAD, which is Mutually Assured Destruction, so each user
[16:19] deposits into a two-of-two
[16:23] multi-sig wallet, and then if they don't sign it, then
[16:27] that money is just destroyed. So there's a certain trust, but it's very limited.
[16:31] There's ways you can get around that, whether you have a bond that is
[16:35] sliced if the user doesn't sign the
[16:39] transactions they're supposed to, or one way that we're looking
[16:43] at doing it is having a third signatory, which will be operated by us,
[16:47] which is just an arbitrator, and then on the end of the game,
[16:51] it will automatically just sign the transaction to the winner, and then the winner
[16:55] only needs to sign that transaction. So effectively, you'd have a two-of-three
[16:59] multi-sig wallet that both users deposit into at the start of the game,
[17:03] and then at the end, we'll sign the transaction, and the winner will sign
[17:07] the transaction, and that's only in the case where the loser doesn't sign the
[17:11] transaction for whatever reason, and they would have to create a broken
[17:15] client and do all sorts of work to even be able to do that in the first place,
[17:19] and even then, it wouldn't work with this in place. But, bringing
[17:23] Dash Platform into the equation, data contracts right now,
[17:27] they don't have any sort of layer one interoperability.
[17:31] They can't be used as a transaction criteria, whereas
[17:35] in the future, they're not smart contracts in that sense. A future
[17:39] iteration, an early iteration intends for the ability
[17:43] to have Dash Platform data contracts to be able to
[17:47] be used in transactions. So, I would be able to say
[17:51] the output of this, so I would be able to write
[17:55] two transactions, but only one of them is valid, and that would be the
[17:59] valid one based on the winner. So, if this data contract is written to in
[18:03] this form, that this transaction's valid, i.e. the payment to the winner, otherwise
[18:07] this one is, and that way, there would be no third party. It would all be done
[18:11] via Dash Platform, and it would all be trusted or
[18:15] trustless, really. And the whole point is that
[18:19] that goes beyond just this game. That goes to any sort of escrow
[18:23] situation, any situation where that proof of transaction or
[18:27] proof of event occurring external to the transaction is stored
[18:31] on the database. So, it's really powerful.
[18:35] ... ...
[18:39] We just got a little bit of feedback from Ryan's side, but it should finish out in a moment.
[18:43] So, then, okay. So, it sounds like this sort of engine is
[18:47] reusable, not only for other games, but even just for other basic escrow
[18:51] requiring applications. Yeah, I mean, Platform has
[18:55] huge, you know, ramifications in terms of anything like that,
[18:59] really, and the gaming is a great example, and it's one where we can build this reference
[19:03] project and this full product that uses
[19:07] that, but there are examples beyond that as well, and
[19:11] it's huge where any multiple parties need to reach some
[19:15] resolution or agreement where that data can be stored on Platform
[19:19] and then used as a transaction criteria. It's just, yeah,
[19:23] it's very powerful, and I'm excited to demonstrate this in the
[19:27] game, and to provide a library that allows other
[19:31] developers, game developers or Unity developers, to use
[19:35] this in their projects. But, yeah, it does go beyond that.
[19:39] I mean, even most of the casino games in
[19:43] Vegas are built using Unity. This is not a, you know, small technology.
[19:47] Unity is used by millions of developers from
[19:51] indie, small, one-man teams to, you know, thousand
[19:55] developer teams. It's a very big project, and
[19:59] building that Unity library is obviously the first step of the
[20:03] sort of Dash Platform and Dash gaming sort of journey
[20:07] in that regards. So, yeah, I'm very excited.
[20:11] - So, let's see.
[20:15] I don't know that that is a...
[20:19] Does that question make sense to anybody? - It sort of does, but it's kind of
[20:25] different in relation... I'll answer it anyway.
[20:29] So, WeChat money to Dash Platform. No.
[20:33] You can send WeChat to someone and have them convert it
[20:37] into Dash and then use Dash to top up your Dash Platform credits, but you will just
[20:41] use Dash on Dash Platform. You're not going to be using a separate currency. Apart from
[20:45] you may get people that release tokens on Dash Platform. We'll get into that in a
[20:49] future video, I'm sure. But if you were looking to buy Dash,
[20:53] you could use WeChat, and a Dash Platform application could actually act
[20:57] as the escrow provider for that in a way, so that they could have a
[21:01] proof of funds, a third-party escrow.
[21:05] You could do, effectively, a LocalBitcoins using Dash Platform, and I think that project's already
[21:09] been worked on, and may have been talked about last week, very briefly.
[21:13] So, yeah. - Okay, so people can, I mean, in its
[21:17] limited form, people can play this game right now, if we give
[21:21] the URL, right? - Yeah, it's just on summoners.gg.
[21:25] It is a very... Yeah, it's a very basic demo.
[21:29] So, it's... At this stage, you know, it's a proof
[21:33] of concept, it's a minimum viable product. We are looking to iterate
[21:37] on it, probably not until Q4 2022, because we're going to
[21:41] wait until Platform's a little bit more stable. There's been exciting news this week
[21:45] about a release on that front, going to
[21:49] a testnet, but we're going to be sort of stepping back from this for a little bit,
[21:53] and then we'll be hitting it again in Q4. So, right now,
[21:57] playable demo state, we'll probably work on some other proof of concept
[22:01] in terms of, you know, maybe the staking side of things,
[22:05] we'll have a testnet version with that on pretty, you know, in the next quarter, but
[22:09] it's going to be a slower development pace by now. - I was just
[22:13] going to ask about testnet. Do you have plans to
[22:17] make this testnet compatible, and
[22:21] if so, when is that happening? - Yeah, so
[22:25] I mean, we built a game, just an important sort of little segue
[22:29] on this. We built a game almost two years ago now, maybe three years ago,
[22:33] where there was a coin flip on testnet, effectively,
[22:37] and it was a provably fair coin flip, and that was, again, using that same
[22:41] Layer 1 transaction signatures. So, you know, we're really happy to
[22:45] do the Layer 1 stuff
[22:49] on testnet again. It's just the stability of
[22:53] Dash Platform and developing against that, and basically how we
[22:57] gracefully interact with Dash Platform. Obviously, myself and Ryan
[23:01] and even, you know, there is another project I think Tim's working on,
[23:05] are trying to solve for that wallet decentralized
[23:09] application interaction layer. The way I'm
[23:13] approaching it is this metamask-style wallet where it all creates
[23:17] keys to write to certain data contracts and share them with the decentralized application,
[23:21] but do we want to, you know, build a project where
[23:25] you're importing a mnemonic and then it's handling all of that, or do we want to try and
[23:29] extrapolate that away and get that done now? And that's kind of where
[23:33] my focus is for this next quarter, that I want to not try and do
[23:37] everything in every individual vapp whilst we're waiting on platform. I want to build
[23:41] this sort of more, you know, this gateway solution in terms of
[23:45] this wallet that can handle all those keys and all the transaction signing, the reading and writing
[23:49] to Dash Platform, and sort of elegantly extrapolate that
[23:53] away from any dApp developers and dApps themselves. So that's
[23:57] kind of my focus for this next quarter.
[24:01] Oh, please go ahead, Ryan. I was going to say, do you have any plans to
[24:05] monetize the app itself? At this stage, no.
[24:09] The core goal for this project really is that reference project.
[24:13] I'd love to see it be a production success. I enjoy the gameplay.
[24:17] I want to take this to production. I want it to be visual. I want it
[24:21] to be almost like a eureka moment for
[24:25] any game developer that once sees this, they'll play it. They'll be just like,
[24:29] "This is great. How is it using Dash Platform?" They'll see how easy it is to use Dash
[24:33] Platform. So we will take it all that way. We will try and turn it into a
[24:37] production success with actual users using it. And then at some point, maybe
[24:41] we would look to monetize it. Ultimately, I wouldn't make that decision myself.
[24:45] I would put that before the DAO. I would give them the option to say,
[24:49] "Hey, yes, we want this to go and be a property as part of the diff's portfolio,
[24:53] or we want this to be monetized slightly so that those
[24:57] funds can be used for marketing and it can be independent
[25:01] of the DAO's funding." But ultimately, I wouldn't
[25:05] make that choice myself. That would be the network's choice.
[25:09] And obviously, everything would be MIT licensed because that's the whole
[25:13] purpose of the incubator. Everything would be fully open source.
[25:17] Well, that was something I sure hadn't considered or heard of before.
[25:21] Ash, you're saying that games like this,
[25:25] should they ever be in a state that they can generate profit,
[25:29] that that profit could be directed anywhere? And in this case,
[25:33] it could be directed to somewhere like the diff, where the network
[25:37] itself can have these profits? Yeah. Ultimately,
[25:41] I don't think the diff would own it outright 100%. There would have to be
[25:45] some operating entity. I mean, they could own it outright 100% and then
[25:49] pay an operating entity to handle that side of things.
[25:53] It just depends what the diff is, the appetite of the diff and the DAO.
[25:57] The whole network has basically funded the building of this project as a
[26:01] reference project. If it then becomes an independent success of being
[26:05] a pure reference project, or they want it to stand on its
[26:09] own two feet, become revenue generating, bring that yield back into the network
[26:13] so that can be then reinvested, however that works, I'm game.
[26:17] Ultimately, that decision belongs to the network,
[26:21] not to me. You're game? Yeah.
[26:25] I'm game. I'm very game. And it'd be exciting for me to
[26:29] see that happen. Ultimately, this
[26:33] project, the advantage of this with many of the incubator projects is
[26:37] that we're killing multiple birds with one stone, effectively.
[26:41] This is a great reference project. It's the justification for building out a great library that
[26:45] other developers can use. It further tests and stresses Dash Platform.
[26:49] It could become a good stand-alone project. There's so much to this
[26:53] that is advantageous to the network. It's just logical.
[26:57] I'm very excited to see what's next there.
[27:01] You may have touched on this already, but maybe you could
[27:05] recap on it or expound on it.
[27:09] What do you plan on using Dash Platform for
[27:13] in the game? Would there
[27:17] be other alternatives? What would be the alternative, and what would be the pros and cons?
[27:21] I touched on this regarding the staking, so a brief
[27:25] recap on that is without Dash Platform, we can do a
[27:29] mutual assertion destruction, a multi-sig wallet, like two or
[27:33] three signatures with an arbitrator. With Dash Platform,
[27:37] the next iteration will have the ability for Dash Platform data
[27:41] to be used as a transaction criteria so that we
[27:45] could step back. There's no arbitrator needed.
[27:49] Arbitrator, arbitrator. You wouldn't need that third party. It would just be
[27:53] a two of two, but the transactions would be pre-signed,
[27:57] but only the one where the winner that had that
[28:01] data in Dash Platform would actually be a valid transaction.
[28:05] That's one part of it. The other part of it is game state. Rather than
[28:09] saying, "Hey, here's this centralized party that we're relying on for the state of our
[28:13] current game and what we agree on," we can write all that data. We can say,
[28:17] "Hey, this is what the player did with their first move, their second move, their third
[28:21] move," and that historical log will be immutable and on
[28:25] the blockchain and Dash Platform. That kind of thing is very
[28:29] powerful in terms of having that transparency but also removing
[28:33] that component. If you can say, "Okay, here's
[28:37] an application you can run in a browser and it will handle and read and write all that
[28:41] data without any third party," you're reading and writing data to Dash Platform.
[28:45] It is a fully decentralized application at that point. This is the whole
[28:49] beauty of Dash Platform versus Ethereum Smart Contracts.
[28:53] You're not... You know that data is valid
[28:57] because it's that data. You're doing the execution on your side
[29:01] rather than the Ethereum virtual machine. In the future, maybe we'll have
[29:05] more of that capability but there's no third party.
[29:09] You're not saying, "Hey, I need someone else to matchmake for me. I need someone else to
[29:13] handle the data of what's happening in this game. I'm just running an application on my
[29:17] device, be that my mobile phone or my browser." Again, Unity
[29:21] you can publish to browser, to mobile phones, to desktop. It's a
[29:25] multi-platform system. Instead of saying,
[29:29] "This service needs to be running for this game to be playable," this game
[29:33] is there. It's on everything I need for that,
[29:37] whether I'm matchmaking and looking for an opponent or whether
[29:41] I need to know what that opponent's moves have been. That can all be stored on Dash Platform
[29:45] and I don't need to rely on anyone
[29:49] to access that. No one can stop me accessing that at all.
[29:53] Just to recap from my understanding, what's
[29:57] interesting about this is that all of the execution,
[30:01] the code execution is done on
[30:05] the client's browsers, but the data can be stored
[30:09] on what would normally be a server, but in our case
[30:13] it's going to be Dash Platform, and that's what makes it you can have
[30:17] the full application. If you needed any kind of server-side
[30:21] execution, then we would need either smart
[30:25] contracts on Dash Platform or we would need a separate server, but you're
[30:29] saying that the game doesn't need any server-side code execution,
[30:33] just server-side code storage, or not
[30:37] code storage, but data storage, state storage.
[30:41] That is what makes Dash Platform unique as far as
[30:45] I can tell in this space,
[30:49] and this is one of those games that will test that
[30:53] and demonstrate that. I'm looking forward to a stable test net
[30:57] that we can port this onto and to
[31:01] show that, because I think that's one of the things that's been a big mystery to people
[31:05] is how do decentralized
[31:09] applications really work on Dash Platform?
[31:13] In a way, it's not even really a decentralized application. It's
[31:17] a decentralized state storage where the
[31:21] execution is happening on the clients.
[31:25] Each client can validate that.
[31:29] You're not trusting somebody else and how
[31:33] their client is operating. You can validate that that data matches your
[31:37] expectations and that it's been done in the right way.
[31:41] The data contracts provide the schema for how that is done and the structure.
[31:45] That is the beauty of Dash Platform. I hope we can try
[31:49] and communicate that better. I hope DCG can communicate that better
[31:53] to developers and to the community. I think that
[31:57] it's a very important point. To be able to take
[32:01] advantages of the kinds of things you guys are talking about, namely to access this
[32:05] decentralized storage wherein the execution
[32:09] of applications takes place on the client side only,
[32:13] are we talking about DAPI? Am I using an old-fashioned
[32:17] term here? What would the client need to do in order to be able
[32:21] to interact in the way that we're describing?
[32:25] Would there need to be a download of some kind, a browser extension?
[32:29] In terms of actually reading and writing the data,
[32:33] reading the data could be done without any other
[32:37] else running. You can just use the JavaScript library or whatever. There's multiple
[32:41] libraries and it's very lightweight. You don't have to download the blockchain,
[32:45] sync headers, whatever it is. You can use a library which you're then relying on a trusted
[32:49] node to give you that data, but you can independently verify
[32:53] that with multiple nodes. There's no issue there, really.
[32:57] In terms of actually writing the data, you would need to have a Dash account in
[33:01] some form, whether that's a wallet. You would need a wallet or even a
[33:05] private key, technically. You would need to be able to
[33:09] have that, whether you've installed an extension, you're using a web
[33:13] wallet, whatever it is, you would have to have something to be able to write that data
[33:17] with. The DAPI term that you're
[33:21] using, usually when people talk about an API,
[33:25] they're usually talking about application
[33:29] programming interface. It's usually
[33:33] a client that's requesting data, and
[33:37] that data, typically these days, that data comes back in the
[33:41] form of JSON, JavaScript Object
[33:45] Notation. It's just data. You're requesting data, you're getting data back.
[33:49] DAPI is just doing that exact same thing,
[33:53] but instead of interacting with a server,
[33:57] a trusted server, you're interacting
[34:01] with one of the Dash master nodes as your server
[34:05] instead of some corporate entity.
[34:09] That's the difference, and I think that term is still, it's not an
[34:13] old-fashioned, it's not an old term, that DAPI is still a
[34:17] thing. Yeah, DAPI is still
[34:21] a thing, so you're using the term properly, but that usually doesn't
[34:25] involve requests for execution.
[34:29] It sometimes can, and I'm not a master programmer by any
[34:33] means, but usually it's a request for data, not a request
[34:37] for a function.
[34:41] Typically, you'd use the term RPC for requesting a functional
[34:45] call. And so, the wallet that
[34:49] you and AJ are working on, Ryan,
[34:53] the wallet that we covered two or three weeks ago here on
[34:57] the show, is that something that would
[35:01] perform these functions that you're talking about, so that no one
[35:05] would need to download more than, just say, that wallet to be able to get the full
[35:09] interaction of what one envisions the summoner's game to eventually be?
[35:13] Yeah, like, Ash can touch on this again when I'm done, but
[35:17] like he said, you need some kind of wallet
[35:21] to do the requests because that costs a small amount
[35:25] of Dash when you're requesting data, or when you're requesting
[35:29] to store data, at least. The wallet, so yes, our Dash
[35:33] wallet, our browser wallet
[35:37] would be able to perform that function, given that
[35:41] there are integrations with the game, but Ash
[35:45] could maybe talk a little bit more about that. Yeah, ultimately,
[35:49] the way we're looking at doing this, the approach that we're taking, myself and
[35:53] Ryan, are different but complementary. Mine's more focused using
[35:57] the SDK side of things that CoreGroup have released, which
[36:01] has a lot of dependencies, and I appreciate that Ryan's
[36:05] wallet is, it's called Vanilla, but I
[36:09] feel that's somewhat of a derogatory term these days, but it's more of a purist solution.
[36:13] It removes a lot of these dependencies, it's probably going to be more efficient and more secure,
[36:17] so I like it, and in time,
[36:21] there'll be established standards for how these wallets
[36:25] and DApps integrate. Here is the communication
[36:29] expected from a decentralized application, here is how the wallet will respond to that
[36:33] and vice versa. As we build out that standard,
[36:37] his wallet will have that, my wallet will have that, it will be
[36:41] something that we work on and we iterate going forwards, and we'll work together on that standard
[36:45] in the same way any sort of, the World Web Consortium
[36:49] agrees on HTML5 standards will have this communication layer
[36:53] as a standard, and that means that no matter what wallet
[36:57] the user has, even let's say Metamask added full-platform support,
[37:01] they would use the same structure, no matter what wallet, the user can use
[37:05] any wallet with any decentralized application, any supported wallet,
[37:09] I guess you could say. It should be agnostic,
[37:13] it shouldn't be locked into any provider in any structure.
[37:17] That would be a step further, that would probably come later though,
[37:21] like the prototype, the initial minimum viable product
[37:25] would most likely just come with the wallet that
[37:29] Ash has in mind, and then we would build integrations as we go
[37:33] based on what Ash just said, the standards that emerge.
[37:37] Okay. So,
[37:41] I don't know, maybe I just haven't joined that many conversations in years past,
[37:45] but this is certainly the first conversation I've joined that is about
[37:49] a game on Dash. Is this the first game on Dash, Ash?
[37:53] Yeah, it was a project back in 2018 that
[37:57] received some funding to build a Dash game. It was some students at the university
[38:01] that were working on game development in their third or fourth year, I believe.
[38:05] They came up with some concepts, but they never released anything, and that project,
[38:09] as far as I'm concerned, is abandoned and unfortunately
[38:13] did not go anywhere. Ourselves,
[38:17] myself and Alex, we built a game via the incubator again almost, yeah,
[38:21] like I said, three years ago, I think now, pretty much, maybe two and a half years ago,
[38:25] that's a coin flip game, a provably fair coin flip game.
[38:29] Very simple, very simple for developers to basically use to
[38:33] understand how you can use BL6 as
[38:37] entropy for random number generation. I would say
[38:41] between that and the other coin flip games, those are probably the ones that I
[38:45] know of. Brian, do you know of any other Dash or
[38:49] games? No, I don't. Yeah. Okay.
[38:53] Okay, well, that covers the questions that I had.
[38:57] I know that I'm still just left here reeling about, for example,
[39:01] so, diff aside, profits from games
[39:05] deployed onto the Dash network, say, by the incubator or by
[39:09] anybody else, could, for example, also burn profits,
[39:13] right? Couldn't profits just automatically be burned.
[39:17] Yeah, I mean, again, it's open-ended how people approach that.
[39:21] We've seen other projects in the crypto ecosystem that have
[39:25] used burning as a mechanic for even minting new tokens
[39:29] as well. There's all sorts of possibilities there, absolutely.
[39:33] Right. Oh, there's
[39:39] a good question from James, just to reiterate on the summoner's
[39:43] side of things. The game that this is sort of most analogous
[39:47] to would be Hearthstone, but instead of Hearthstone
[39:51] having just a flat grid like that where players and
[39:55] creatures attack each other whilst they're protecting their main units, this just has a hex grid.
[39:59] I know the UI isn't the most intuitive, but
[40:03] that'll come in time. All of these things are iterations. You start
[40:07] with the minimum viable product, and you iterate and improve. We'll make it
[40:11] easier for you to understand. We'll have a tutorial. There'll
[40:15] be nice cards in a hand, in a deck. Right now, the art
[40:19] style is just very basic. It is just a -- and I do have
[40:23] to run it when I demo it with people. I have to act as somewhat of a
[40:27] concierge. I have to help them and explain things, but that will get better.
[40:31] It is like Slay the Spire, but it's not like a roguelike, but from the visual
[40:35] aspect, the future design will be like Slay the Spire.
[40:39] Realistically, right now, the goal is more a Hearthstone or Magic
[40:43] the Gathering, which for Amanda, if you're unfamiliar with either of those,
[40:47] and Ryan too, they are incredibly popular games
[40:51] with millions of users, and they're very revenue successful
[40:55] as well. People put a lot of money into those games,
[40:59] and they work on mobile as well, which it's a cross-platform game. The goal
[41:03] is that you can play it casually and have just a five-minute match, or you can
[41:07] play it on your phone super casually, however you like, really.
[41:11] That's the goal with this. We want to be as accessible as possible
[41:15] to anyone. - Fab. Okay.
[41:19] Well, absent any further comments from any of us, I'll say thanks for
[41:23] joining Ryan and me today. Ash and viewers,
[41:27] we look forward to seeing you all again same time, same place next week.
[41:31] Yeah? - Thanks, Ash. - Thank you, guys. - Bye, everyone.
