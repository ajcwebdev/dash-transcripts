## Transcript

[00:00] [Intro Music] In 1997, the Project for the New American Century was founded by a small group of neocons.
[00:12] A few years later, they published "Rebuilding America's Defenses." In the intro, they wrote, "At present, the United States faces no global rival.
[00:20] America's grand strategy should aim to preserve and extend this advantageous position as far into the future as possible. For peace, of course."
[00:28] They acknowledged the difficulty in seeing this realized unless something drastic were to happen. In their words, "The process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one,
[00:38] absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event, like a new Pearl Harbor." One year later, two planes took down three buildings at free-fall speed in New York City.
[00:47] The following month, the so-called "Patriot Act" was signed into law, and the never-ending war on terrorism kicked off. "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste."
[00:55] "Never let a crisis, whether real or manufactured, go to waste." That's what the upstanding employees at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, are trying to do.
[01:04] They're making the case that use of any privacy functionality in crypto need be reported under the guise of stopping terrorism. Cited as justification is Section 311 of the USA Patriot Act.
[01:15] In their press release, the geniuses at FinCEN call it, "a new regulation to enhance transparency in convertible virtual currency, or CVC, mixing, and combat terrorist financing."
[01:26] They give as examples the latest boogeyman of the U.S. regime and its accomplices. "It's very clear this proposal was in the works long before the conflict in the Middle East broke out,
[01:35] but it's also very clear that they quickly pivoted and are trying to take advantage of this conflict to use it to get this proposal through." If their proposal gets implemented, FinCEN seeks to mandate or deputize tens of thousands of businesses
[01:49] to surveil, monitor, and report when a transaction is used or is suspected to have used a CVC. "Just what is a CVC mixer?" you ask.
[01:57] According to the brains at FinCEN, the term CVC mixer means any person, group, service, code, tool, or function that facilitates CVC mixing, which they acknowledge is quite broad, though they say, given the nature of CVC mixing, FinCEN deems the breadth of this definition to be necessary.
[02:12] "They're saying that these few people who are using these tools now mean that everyone who uses these tools should be punished." But despite making sweeping claims about the need to surveil and amass data to combat terrorism due to Hamas and others,
[02:24] FinCEN doesn't provide any specific figures of crypto support that entities supposedly netted. Instead, they cite blockchain analysis firm that courts government agencies as clients.
[02:34] As chainalysis is such a key ally for the studs at FinCEN, let's look a bit more at that outfit. Earlier this year, they released their crypto crime report.
[02:42] In it, it's claimed that the source of 85% of illicit crypto sent to mixers is stolen funds. Well, that seems like an easy fix for individuals to move their holdings off centralized custodial services.
[02:53] Later, a graph depicts total crypto by type. Two things to note.
[02:57] First, the biggest slice in 2022 is from sanctions. At least they're fair enough to mention that this was due to OFAC's zealous campaign against Tornado Cash and others.
[03:06] And second, there's almost nothing in the terrorism financing slice. And lastly, here's another graph.
[03:11] According to chainalysis, less than a quarter of a percent of all crypto transactions involve such coins. I wonder how that compares to Federal Reserve notes.
[03:20] Actually, that is something that the fine FinCEN peeps know about. A 2020 leak of thousands of documents from FinCEN, which came to be known as the FinCEN files,
[03:28] shows that FinCEN was complacent about billions of dollars in "dirty money" moving through global banking institutions. Returning to FinCEN's mission statement, things are now a bit more clear.
[03:38] To safeguard THE financial system, they just mean "protect business as usual" and work to thwart any threats to the legacy financial system.
[03:46] Hence, this proposal. As Seth for Privacy noted, the drastic steps governments are taking shows that they're feeling threatened.
[03:52] Indeed, as Joel Valenzuela headlined a recent threat on X, the crypto crackdown is here. His call to action?
[03:59] We have to get into hard work mode. That means not just building new tools and expanding our user base,
[04:04] but looking inward to remove any vestiges of fragility. Offhand, two things seem like low-hanging fruit.
[04:10] The fact that our core development team is incorporated in the U.S. does not bode well. And the fact that our masternode network operates using cleartext does not bode well.
[04:19] A solution to the former was broached in a previous Incubator Weekly episode, and a solution to the latter was broached by XK during his presentation at the Dash Retreat.
[04:28] Seth for Privacy thinks the cryptocurrency world will split into two separate economies, one that functions as an add-on to the traditional finance and compliance regime,
[04:37] and one that acts as an independent and self-sustaining circular economy. Sounds good. Let's make it happen.
[04:42] We're on the right side of history here. And those that are looking to destroy and ban these freedom tech tools,
[04:49] they're on the wrong side of history. Absolutely.
[04:58] Dang, I like it when things include both a problem and a solution. Don't you, Rion?
[05:03] Well, there's nothing more important than the solutions, for sure. But you first have to identify the correct problems to be solving, I think.
[05:11] So they're both important. Right on.
[05:14] Well, today we are talking about one of the more fun solutions in the Dash space currently, which is how do I trade from one crypto to another crypto?
[05:25] And also, how do I earn on crypto outside of... Well, in the case of Dash, outside of the masternode system,
[05:32] how do I earn on my Dash in a permissionless setting? So we're here to talk about the Maya protocol.
[05:38] So you have been digging into this decentralized exchange system pretty heavily recently. Is that right, Rion?
[05:45] Yeah, I've got the bug, I guess you could say, with decentralized exchanges in general. And why they're so important.
[05:57] And so I have been digging quite a bit into Maya, into ThorChain before that. Because I think it's so important that we build this infrastructure.
[06:09] And not just the infrastructure, but we transition people to being, to using decentralized exchanges over centralized exchanges, first and foremost.
[06:20] Where the DEX isn't considered, you know, the second thought to the Coinbases or the Binances or the Krakens of the world.
[06:30] Where rather, we are thinking primarily about DEXs. And then secondarily, about centralized exchanges,
[06:37] if and when we have that need to go into government, bankster coin kind of realm that unfortunately is still necessary to live a life for most people.
[06:54] But our job is to build the tools and the infrastructure so that we can move away from that, that world and move into, like the intro said, freedom technologies, building those out
[07:09] and making them as user friendly as possible. So that we don't have to really like have an ideological conversation with people.
[07:18] We just show them a tool that works better for them in their lives. And that way, that's how we will actually, that's the biggest security that we can have,
[07:28] is a strong user base of people who just love the technology and love the use of a technology rather than having an ideological requirement for it.
[07:41] I'm personally in that camp where I'm very ideological and that drives me. But most people aren't, so we need to build those solutions for them.
[07:50] So what kind of solutions will you be showing us or previewing for us today? What in particular could help move something such as Maya
[08:01] into something that someone would want to use because it is genuinely useful for their lives and not because, "Oh, I'm trying to stay away from centralized exchanges
[08:09] because centralized exchange is bad." Yeah, well, I hate to disappoint right away
[08:15] because I don't have any demos or anything like that particularly prepared. I mostly wanted to have a conversation about Maya and DEXs just again,
[08:26] because I want to repeat to the Dash community and anybody else who's watching how important this is to me.
[08:34] Like they say, a lot of times people will need like six or seven touch points to a certain thing to start even being interested in it.
[08:47] And so if anybody hasn't noticed, we have done quite a few shows on Maya already. I think we've done three on Maya.
[08:57] So we did our first show as I was looking back on it was about eight or nine months ago when we were first introducing the concept.
[09:04] I think we had maybe had done something about 4Chain before that, but no, I don't think we had. And then another one five months ago and then another one three months ago.
[09:14] And so it's about time at three months ago to do another just refresher about where we are and where we're going with Maya.
[09:23] And like I said, I don't have anything done or anything prepared to present. It's just more of a conversation that I wanted to have with you, Amanda,
[09:31] because I know that you have some questions still. And I think that your questions could be useful for other people who are in your position
[09:40] where they've heard about Maya now and they are kind of interested in it, but they still have a lot of questions about it.
[09:48] OK, so I guess I can tell my story a little about, OK, so. When I first understood Maya to have added Dash and for there to have been functionality there,
[10:05] I went to look into LP'ing. This would have been, I don't know, two or three months ago, I don't know.
[10:12] And and then I don't know if I saw a graphic on X or where I saw it on Maya. I don't know where I saw it, but it was a comparison of the AP.
[10:25] I don't know if it's called APY or APR of the various coins on Maya's LPs. And it said, you know, this one's earning this percent.
[10:33] This one's earning this percent. And then it said like Dash earning zero percent.
[10:37] And so I thought, yeah, probably not going to do that. So I I just figured it was because there was like too little liquidity there.
[10:44] And so there was nothing to be earned like a chicken and egg problem. I don't know.
[10:49] OK, and then fast forward to just two weeks ago or something. And now people are blowing up Dash Twitter saying stuff like,
[10:59] oh, like LP'ing annual yields are nearing 40 or 50 percent. This is insane.
[11:06] Like jump in and get this fat stacks of duffs. And so I genuinely have no idea what's going on
[11:12] or where even to find accurate information as far as earnings in LP. Yeah, well, maybe that's a good time to transition to my screen share just so that
[11:23] people can have an idea of what we're talking about and thinking about and looking at the. This is mayascan.org, and this shows the liquidity pool.
[11:37] So also, if people have questions, I want somebody I want people to have to ask their their questions about Maya, particularly if they have concerns or whatnot,
[11:47] so that we can address those from the audience as well. But liquidity pools, this is like the bread and butter of how
[11:58] decentralized exchanges work is you have a series of liquidity pools where each of the liquidity pools is one asset paired with cacao.
[12:09] And cacao is the native token in the Maya decentralized exchange. So you'll see here the top liquidity pool.
[12:18] These are ordered by liquidity, which is measured in any unit that you want. But here it's measured in U.S. dollars.
[12:28] So you can see here the the cacao rune liquidity pool has $34 million in it. And it shows an APR like you were talking about, Amanda, as well.
[12:43] And then here's the Bitcoin cacao liquidity pool with $15 million. And I'll bump this up a little bit here.
[12:52] Wait, so there's more Dash than Bitcoin on Maya? Um, no, we haven't talked about Dash yet.
[13:02] I'm getting there. But yeah, like Bitcoin, the Bitcoin pool has $15 million total.
[13:09] And that's comprised of $7.5 million on each side. $7.5 million of Bitcoin, $7.5 million of cacao.
[13:17] And they're equal in value. And that's that's it's maintained that way programmatically to be equal in value.
[13:26] Now, as we scroll down here, you see so rune, that's the other DEX. That's the token for the Thorchain DEX.
[13:36] So that's the rune and cacao pair. Is that the way one can go from the Thorchain ecosystem to the Maya ecosystem via that pair?
[13:45] Yes. Yep.
[13:48] Yeah. But for this purpose, you can just think of it as a token that has a high liquidity
[13:54] because of whatever reasons. So but you then you have Bitcoin, Ethereum.
[14:00] And then Coogee is was the second native coin added to Maya. And it's taken fourth place in terms of the size of the liquidity pool at $1.5 million.
[14:12] And here you have you scroll down further and you have Tether and Dash finally, which we're approaching $1 million in liquidity.
[14:21] And you can see 67% APR. And that's the number that you were, I think, referring to where you saw it initially at zero.
[14:34] But now it's something very high. And if you if we keep scrolling down here, you can see there are a couple,
[14:43] there are a few others here, USDC and then this rat stake ETH thing. And actually, it does have an APR now.
[14:51] But before, like a couple days ago, it was also showing zero. And that's just to say that like, before it has 30 days worth of data to back it,
[15:03] I think they just defaulted to showing zero percent, even though there probably was more than zero.
[15:08] Because it was less than 30 days old, when you saw the Dash one at zero. And this one was a couple days ago, zero.
[15:18] Now that it has 30 days worth of trading volume, it shows a number here. So I don't know if that answers your question.
[15:25] But it's that was mostly just an artifact of how people show. My scan in particular was showing or maybe the other ones as well, like Eldorado was showing.
[15:34] Okay, well, that just leads me to the question now of is that like, that's that's a real number.
[15:44] Like if I put $100 worth of Dash into Maya, okay, so first of all, does it all stay in Dash or whatever crypto I use?
[15:53] Or I want to say I watched a tutorial where it divides it in half, and puts half into cacao and keeps half in Dash.
[16:01] So how does that work? So yeah, let's say that the most common user experience from people in Dash
[16:09] would probably be that you have some Dash, let's just say 100 Dash for a nice easy round number, and you want to put it in one of these liquidity pools.
[16:18] What it will do under the hood is it will, it will convert half of your 100 Dash into cacao.
[16:28] So you will have 50 Dash, that's native Dash and 50 Dash that has been converted into cacao. And now they're equal value.
[16:39] And then you're exposed to the price fluctuations of both of those assets while in the pool. And that percentage that you're seeing there is basically the, the gain of
[16:52] your share in the pool. So it would be half and half as far as I understand.
[17:00] But then when you when you pull that out, if you did it, if you added to that pool, just Dash, you would only just be able to pull Dash back out.
[17:10] So after, so while you're in the pool, you're exposed to the price action of both of those tokens.
[17:17] And when you pull it back out, then you get what whatever you put in, which was in our example, which was Dash.
[17:28] So whether it turns out to be exactly 66% or not. One thing to remember about this, these numbers is that those those numbers are looking back
[17:40] the past 30 days. They're not looking forward.
[17:44] And they're not really even like an instantaneous rate that you're getting right now at this moment.
[17:52] It's literally the amount that your share has gone up in value. Your share of the pool has gone up in value.
[18:02] In dollar value, not in. So it's not like if that same performance continued without any change for the next
[18:10] year that I would have earned 67 Dash on my initial 100 Dash. Or is it?
[18:18] I guess is it is it denominated? Is the percent denominated in USD or in one of the tokens?
[18:23] That's that's a good question. I believe it's denominated in liquidity units, LP units, as it's called.
[18:34] And that is a 50/50 share of the asset and cacao. But I, I would have to check with one of the Maya guys.
[18:45] But one thing to keep in mind here is that this percentage that will never go below zero because so essentially what it is, is when people are swapping in that pool, whether
[18:59] it's like Bitcoin to Dash or something that's going through Dash, Dash to Bitcoin, people have people are paying fees to do that.
[19:11] And it's those fees that are adding up and increasing the value of your liquidity position. You're you can think of it as like a little bit of a like a small company that has shares
[19:26] and each of these pools has a certain amount of shares. And then when the value of the pool goes up, then everybody that has a share of that pool,
[19:36] their value goes up as well. And the value of the pool being determined just by the basic trading value of the two
[19:45] paired coins. Say again.
[19:48] The value of the pool being determined by the price of both coins in the pool, the price per unit of or or no, is the value of the pool more determined by how much people are
[20:02] willing to pay to trade that pair? I'm just wondering when you say the value of the pool, what value is that?
[20:09] Just the value of the both of the assets. But but I'm I don't want to talk too much about the specific number because I I might
[20:19] have my the verbiage that I'm using might not be exactly correct. So I don't want to I don't want to talk too much about that anymore.
[20:26] But one thing I did want to mention that I didn't actually mention. In the intro, why, like my motivation for for pushing, pushing this integration and
[20:40] this like it's I can imagine somebody might be like, OK, this is a show, not a not a cacao pool show or a Maya show.
[20:49] But we're talking about Maya quite a bit. The reason for this is, if you look at if you take a step back and just look at how
[20:58] Dash is perceived in the whole crypto market. What do most people look at when they are thinking about the viability and the success
[21:08] of a project? What what comes to mind that people look at the most coin market cap ranking?
[21:14] Yeah, yeah, exactly. And coin coin market cap ranking is a product of two things.
[21:22] It's it's the amount of coins that you have in circulation multiplied by the the price of that thing.
[21:30] And the price of that thing is right now determined by centralized exchanges. And I have I have this, you know, I'm torn between these two thoughts.
[21:44] One thought is that our price is 100 percent honest and completely accurate picture of the value of this project.
[21:57] And there's nothing wrong going on. It's 100 percent market driven pricing.
[22:04] But the thing to remember is that when prices are determined, that price signal is coming from an exchange.
[22:13] And right now it's coming from centralized exchanges. So when you see the price of Dash, it's always associated with a certain exchange.
[22:23] And so people that are a little bit more experienced in cryptocurrency will know that there isn't just one price of Dash.
[22:29] There's there's many, many prices of Dash, and they they generally tend to be pretty close to each other on the market.
[22:37] Like you might see one exchange saying that the price of Dash is 30 dollars per Dash and another mark.
[22:44] Another exchange might say 32 dollars per Dash and another one might say 31. And they're all pretty close.
[22:50] But nonetheless, there are different prices on the market. And being being that the centralized exchanges have so much more volume than decentralized
[23:04] exchanges, decentralized exchanges are really a thing of the past two or three years, it seems like there really have come to be.
[23:13] But in the future, the future that I want is a future where the price of any asset is determined mostly by the decentralized exchange price price and not the price that Coinbase
[23:28] is showing or the price that Binance is showing or the price that Kraken is showing. But the price that literally the price that you see quoted on like some Bloomberg News
[23:41] TV show is the price that they're getting from, let's say, the Maya exchange against stable coin like USDT or something like that or USDC and that that price dominates and
[23:58] that the other prices of centralized exchanges are trying to meet that price instead of decentralized exchanges seeing a price on Coinbase and then saying, oh, I'm lower than
[24:11] that or I'm higher than that. I should I should arbitrage and, you know, take make the price closer to the centralized
[24:19] exchange. It's this is this concept of price discovery and price setting, like which the one that has the highest volume is the one that's considered more true.
[24:31] And so I didn't finish my thought about the other side of my my thinking, like the one side was that these prices that we're getting from centralized exchanges, they're completely
[24:44] honest. The other side is that these prices could very well be manipulated. Like if Binance has...
[24:51] What do you mean by that? Yeah, yeah.
[24:54] We're literally trusting Binance and Kraken and Coinbase to give us an honest number of what the price is.
[25:03] And we we honestly don't know. So are you suggesting that they could possibly be selling Dash or any asset, any digital
[25:13] asset for that matter, at one price behind the scenes and then reporting that they sold it at a higher price or a lower price?
[25:21] And they're just hoping that the person that they sold it to at the real price just keeps his mouth shut so no one figures it out?
[25:27] Well, I'm saying that that the order books where price prices are created, those order books are literally not open source.
[25:37] We have no way of verifying that those prices are actually true. Like, like I said, this is conspiracy land to some degree.
[25:49] What's this have to do with Dash, though, other than multiplying your Dash and giving Kakao value?
[25:56] Well, it has to do with Dash because there is some amount of... There is...
[26:03] What am I trying to say? There is some chance that these prices that are giving that are given to us by centralized
[26:15] exchanges could be manipulated because we don't know what their order books are actually doing.
[26:21] They could just be giving us bad data. And so you're saying if if if for whatever reason, Dash or any asset is in the negative
[26:32] case, not in the favor of that exchange, we didn't take them on enough golf trips, we didn't take them on enough yacht trips, then perhaps they could report a lower price for...
[26:46] Yeah. And I think that that I think that that that that that is not likely, but it's definitely
[26:53] possible. And I'm not I'm not experienced enough to talk about the the details of price manipulation
[27:05] and what goes on in centralized exchanges. All I know is it's not open source like a decentralized exchanges, where a decentralized
[27:13] exchange, we know exactly that those prices are actually happening on the market and that the the price is like it's verifiable.
[27:27] And so in the future, I want... Basically, yeah, long story short, if there is an avenue for abuse, then we then it probably
[27:37] will be abused by someone sooner or later. And so given that these order books are closed source, that is an avenue for abuse.
[27:47] So we can at least have like a soft suspicion that sooner or later that route will be taken. So better to just not rely on it.
[27:55] Yeah, exactly. And so if you just step back again with with the market capitalization of Dash, you know,
[28:04] the the amount of Dash in circulation is that is verifiable. The price is not verifiable so long as we're getting those price signals signals from centralized
[28:14] exchanges. But if we can get to a point where we have price signals and circulating supply that
[28:20] are both completely verifiable, then we will know that the market capitalization calculation is a market phenomenon and not something that's that's potentially manipulated by
[28:34] centralized exchanges. And like we like we started off, it's very important.
[28:41] That number, that market cap is our number one, the number one data point that people look to for the viability of a project.
[28:50] And I'm kind of sick of I'm sick of Dash being so low in market capitalization compared to the utility and what I perceive as the value of this project.
[29:03] And there is some non-zero chance that there are that there is manipulation going on in the centralized exchanges.
[29:11] And I want to build towards a future where that's just not possible because most of the volume is actually going through verifiable decentralized exchanges like Maya.
[29:23] So that's that's my big tangent motivation for why Maya is is important enough to focus many episodes on and developer attention to.
[29:37] So let's see. PMA asks, roughly speaking, what is the current volume handled on Maya as compared to
[29:44] Thorchain? I don't know. That's something that we can look up.
[29:48] I would I would probably venture to guess that it's something like 10 percent or less where volume and total total value locked in the protocol is probably less than 10 percent
[30:02] of Thorchain. But that doesn't I'm not too concerned about Maya versus Thorchain.
[30:08] We're all on the same same team as far as that goes, because they're both decentralized and public open source projects.
[30:17] OK, so let's talk then about what can, what will, what is Incubator doing to move this effort forward to start getting, in this case, Maya, but yeah, Maya more relevant in our
[30:32] ecosystem so that the prices reported of Dash and of other coins in that ecosystem start to become more relevant.
[30:39] Yeah, so so there are a few things that I first one thing to report is that just as a status update.
[30:49] We recently, if people remember, Maya started by requiring six Genesis nodes and the Genesis nodes were like trusted, trusted entities that were running nodes to bootstrap the to
[31:10] bootstrap the ecosystem in a trusted way before Maya, before Kakao had enough value to be backed by economic backing of Kakao and whatnot.
[31:24] And so Dash was one of those six Genesis nodes, and the process was that the Genesis nodes would start and everything would be running through those six Genesis nodes.
[31:37] So if you trusted those Genesis nodes to not steal your money, then you could trust the system and it had nothing really to do with with economics necessarily.
[31:47] It just had to do with who are these six Genesis nodes and and do I trust them so that two thirds of them won't collude to steal the Bitcoin or the Ethereum or whatever that that
[32:01] is in the pools because they could have. But now the status update is that our Genesis node has churned out of the pool of validators
[32:15] and won't be going back in as a Genesis node anymore. So our job with the incubator, one of our jobs was to do the integration, the actual
[32:24] coding work. One of the other jobs was to run one of these Genesis nodes.
[32:28] That job is done, like the coding is more or less done and the running of the Genesis node is also done.
[32:37] And now the Maya validators are, I think, almost exclusively what's called now liquidity nodes where they're backed by the liquidity that the that those nodes are bonding.
[32:54] And we'll talk a little bit more about that in to answer your question about what the incubator can be doing.
[33:00] But that's the status update is that the Genesis node is done and now the validators are all liquidity bonded nodes.
[33:08] So that brings us to the first thing that we can do as a Dash community to continue contributing to to this ecosystem, and that is to to start running a liquidity node.
[33:24] So I don't know if how many people are interested in in this, but and let's see, I don't know.
[33:33] Yeah, let's let's let's turn back to my screen for a minute here. I'm going to go over to the network tab.
[33:43] My scan dot org slash network and let's see how many nodes how many nodes are actually. Securing the network now, I don't see a summary number, but if you just add these up,
[34:03] it's probably oh, let's see. So this many nodes, these are the these are all the nodes, and I would probably estimate
[34:17] that's about 20 or 30. I don't know why it doesn't.
[34:20] Let's see. Yeah, 20 active validators, 21 and 15 standby validators.
[34:26] What are these validators and what part can we play with this? The 21 active validators.
[34:36] These are if you think about like if you think about it in terms of Dash, this would be comparable to the amount of master nodes.
[34:44] So instead of 4000 ish or or 3500 master nodes that are basically in control of the network, it's 21 in the case of in the case of Maya, and there are 15 backup that are that are
[35:04] standby that that can that churn in and churn out on a on a certain time frame. So you can see this little countdown clock here, nine hours, 44 minutes till the next
[35:19] churn. And when the next churn happens, that basically what that means is there are one or more nodes
[35:27] that that get sent from being active validators to being on standby. And so like the oldest node in the set or the one with the least bond in the set.
[35:40] So does this say how much they're being paid and how would we how would we interact? This is the bond.
[35:48] This is sorted by the amount of bond. And you can see that this is in units of cacao.
[35:53] So this one, the highest bonded node is one point eight or one point nine million cacao. And with cacao being close to about a dollar now, that's about two million dollars.
[36:09] So that's a higher value than a master node, for example. But if you scroll down to the bottom here, there is I don't this one looks like some
[36:21] kind of an outlier. This might be a genesis node that's still just straggling.
[36:25] But but this one, three hundred and eighty thousand. So three hundred eighty thousand cacao, which is roughly three hundred eighty thousand dollars
[36:35] worth. You could be a you could be a validator node in the Maya network.
[36:43] So my threshold, like you need to meet or exceed the capital bonded by the existing nodes in order to begin competing to be a validator.
[36:55] Yes, because it's not it's not like the dash network where where anybody can just put a certain number of dash and then you can be a master node.
[37:06] That's not how it works in this in this network. In this network, you're competing to be the highest bonded node.
[37:13] So and it looks like the minimum amount here is about three hundred eighty thousand dollars. So don't even think about it if you don't have three hundred eighty thousand dollars
[37:24] worth of cacao slash other assets. And one thing to note here is that this is not just cacao.
[37:33] I believe it's denominated in cacao, but in reality, it's what you're bonding is you're bonding both your cacao and the assets that you have in liquidity pools.
[37:46] So let's say that you have like four hundred thousand or two hundred thousand cacao in a pool and whatever whatever amount of dash that that would equate to.
[37:59] So two hundred thousand dollars. Are you suggesting that the Dash community pool its funds to run a node?
[38:06] And so I haven't got there, but thanks for pushing me there. I'm suggesting that we as a community could do this and that that the incubator could
[38:18] could facilitate this in the sense of running the node. So like like, you know, now we ran the Genesis node.
[38:27] And so we have experience running a one of these validator nodes, which consists of running clients for all of the connected the connected coins.
[38:42] Like I'm not sure if my screen is being shared still, but but when you run one of these validators, you're running a Bitcoin node, a Ethereum node, a Rune node and a Dash node and a Coogee node.
[38:56] And so that's a lot of work. And the incubator, specifically Alex and Ash, have figured out how to do all this.
[39:09] And so one of the things that we've discussed is the possibility of continuing to run one of these nodes, but instead of running it as a Genesis node, running as a bonded node.
[39:21] And then one other thing that I haven't talked about yet is that you can delegate to to create this bond.
[39:31] So instead of one person having all of this cacao or liquidity units required to run this and to get in the runnings for being an active validator, you can split it up into eight
[39:49] parts total. So let's let's look at this 800,000 one.
[39:54] Instead of one person having 800,000 cacao worth of bond, you could find eight different people who have $100,000 worth of bond and all get together and and create one of these
[40:09] nodes, kind of like a shared master node. But it's actually in this case, you don't actually have to send any money to the person
[40:19] that's running this, which is called the node operator. You don't actually have to send your bond to that person.
[40:25] You just delegate it as a as like you point the, yeah, it's almost like a mining tool. You have a machine, but you point your okay.
[40:35] And as do you happen to know, is eight the maximum number of ways that a node can be divided?
[40:40] Yeah, I think that is the number. And I can verify that.
[40:45] But I'm almost 100% sure that that it is eight. So that's the one thing that I wanted to to kind of suggest or talk about, or at least
[40:54] just introduced to people is we have this. We have an opportunity that if people are interested, the incubator could spin this
[41:03] node back up. And instead of like the Genesis just running it, we would have to have it bonded by a certain
[41:12] number of of cacao, like I was showing, and the incubator could run the node. And then whoever is interested in delegating their bond, their liquidity units toward this
[41:26] node, then we would just have to arrange that. So but in terms of like running it, the node, I know that Alex and Ash were running it on
[41:38] AWS infrastructure, but we would probably want to go more with a bare metal approach where we where we have full control over the the node infrastructure itself.
[41:51] And instead of having it on AWS, we would probably try to have it with AJ has experience with running bare metal infrastructure.
[42:04] And we have access to a data center here in Utah that I've actually physically seen the servers.
[42:11] And so that's that's that's one option is we could we could save a lot of money by by doing it that way instead of paying AWS and having the risk of all the nodes running out
[42:24] of AWS. So that's one that's one thing that I would suggest.
[42:27] So we would combine the skill that that Alex has has acquired by with with running the node with with AJ's experience with the bare metal infrastructure and have the incubator
[42:43] run one of these validator nodes. And then whoever in the in the community is interested in bonding or delegating their
[42:55] bond to to this node. We could do that if people are interested.
[42:59] OK, and then is there a lock up time as James Joe is asking here that they should be prepared to put the capital in for?
[43:07] That's a good question. I don't know the answer to that.
[43:11] OK, you're you're you'd like to gauge whether there's even enough interest before beginning to discuss such details.
[43:18] OK, and then and then is it safe to say you'd be looking for a maximum and minimum of eight people or at least a minimum of eight people, because that's what you need to get started?
[43:30] Unless, of course, I guess somebody has enough capital that they'd want to contribute multiple shares worth.
[43:36] Yeah. And if we had more than, you know, more than enough to do two nodes, then we could do that.
[43:41] Right. OK, what am I saying?
[43:42] Yeah. OK, great.
[43:43] So I'm just saying, like, I would probably want more people involved just just to have more people involved.
[43:51] But if we have a few players that are, you know, very they have a lot of resources and they're they're interested in this, then we could definitely do more than one node.
[44:01] So presumably people should reach out to you if they are interested to start talking about this potential.
[44:07] Reach out to you personally. Yeah, I mean, just on the public channels, just have maybe open a discussion about it.
[44:13] So that's the one thing that I wanted to bring up. And the other thing is we're also going to that we we had some some chatter in the Maya
[44:23] Protocol channel about incubator has a web wallet. And I've seen a lot of I've seen a lot of poor user experience, well, experiences regarding
[44:38] some of the other wallets that are in the ecosystem. And and I just don't want that to to turn people off towards contributing here.
[44:47] So so, yeah, we are going to be making an integration with Maya and our web wallet. So if people want just a dash focused user experience for for this, both on the liquidity
[45:03] provision side, adding liquidity to a Maya pool and obviously withdrawing when when they want, there's no lockup period for that for sure.
[45:12] Or or in addition to that, bonding to this node that we talked about running one of these validator nodes and then having people bond their liquidity units to the node, then we
[45:28] will be supporting that whole experience through our incubator wallet. And that will be 100 percent open source.
[45:38] And I know that there are some people that want that wanted this to have a fee so that we could help fund this through fees instead of just treasury funding.
[45:51] But I'm open to either approach. We will probably just we would probably just make it an optional fee that people could
[45:58] pay or not pay if they don't want to do that. So it'd be it'd be optional.
[46:05] But one important thing would be that this would be 100 percent open source, which I don't believe.
[46:10] In fact, I'm pretty sure that they're not. The Eldorado and Thor wallet UIs, I do not believe are open source.
[46:23] And so as much as I would love to trust that everything is 100 percent honest and whatnot, it does give you a little bit more assurance if you can see the source code and see that
[46:36] it's not changing or something like that. Well, not only that, but then if someone who can do a better job than incubator can do
[46:45] with the wallet, they can just fork it and make their own and do better. Right.
[46:49] Yeah. And the more the merrier on this kind of thing.
[46:52] So, yeah, that's what I would encourage as well. So is there any when when WebWallet, Rion, when the WebWallet's already already active,
[47:05] it's just not something that we've promoted because we haven't done like a thorough security audit or anything like that.
[47:11] So we're not we're not promoting it yet, but it is it is functional and it has an interesting username experience that's not tied to platform necessarily, but it's tied to X pubs.
[47:23] So that's something that we were developing for quite a while. And now that we have that and we have the basic functionality of a wallet,
[47:29] it's very straightforward to to add this my integration. We also did code some specific things so that we could do these off return memos that Maya
[47:42] requires. So that's all done and it's all it's all working.
[47:46] It's just not something that we we've brought into or into the into the wallet itself. So we have right now what we have is a separate tool that's that we were building along with
[47:59] the Eldorado team to help them use some of our code to to build their wallet. And so we had to do that for them for that support anyway.
[48:11] But now we're going to take some of that code instead of having it in the standalone, just a very small application that was kind of a more of a proof of concept that, you know,
[48:23] our infrastructure was working like the the wallet transaction creation and stuff like that was working.
[48:31] Now we're going to bring it back, bring it into the into the incubator wallet itself. And like I said, like we we still need to have some kind of security audit done on this
[48:42] or at least some other eyeballs on it before we're comfortable promoting it to the community. So that will take some time.
[48:51] But yeah, well, yeah, I would say Godspeed to that for sure, because for yeah, for some I don't know how you phrased it earlier in the show when you said something like questions
[49:01] that someone like you has, Amanda. But yes, someone like me also has been intimidated somewhat by first of all, when I found out
[49:13] that Maya is not a front end, but is rather a back end. And I have to choose my own front end.
[49:21] And not only do I have to choose my own front end, I have to make the right choice. And then I have to find their website.
[49:27] I have to hope to God I can find their tutorials for someone of my understanding level. And just just that bit alone is is enough of a turn off that if someone were to come
[49:40] to me and say instead, like, oh, no, there's just the integration to use Maya just right in your Dash wallet, you just clickety click right from within your Dash wallet.
[49:49] That would that would be a big help for me. Yeah.
[49:52] And I know that I know that DCG is working on my integrations as well. But I heard that there were there were potentially some issues with with at least the Apple store
[50:02] trying to trying to try to be Apple. Be Apple.
[50:10] Yeah, exactly. And trying to keep Dex's Dex related apps out of the store.
[50:16] And I don't know if that I do know that it's real, that that's a real issue because Brian Foster confirmed that that's what that's what Apple was saying.
[50:27] But I also know that there are currently some lawsuits out or at least challenged legal challenges to Apple's approach to keeping Dex's out from other teams that are not related
[50:40] to Dash. I can't remember who it was, but one of the other players in the in the Dex space was
[50:49] raising legal defenses against Apple's decision there. But regardless, like, the web is also the web is always, or at least we hope, going
[51:00] to be a free and open place to to innovate. And so our web wallet won't be affected by that.
[51:06] Okay, Android is also not affected by that, as far as I know. But it's always you can always bet on the web, just like websites is is always going
[51:20] to be an accessible point. It's not as convenient for some people like that want mobile apps and whatnot.
[51:26] But eventually, you know, our web app will be packageable in both web and mobile and desktop experience that that's a little bit further down the road.
[51:39] But that's the priority that we've decided to go with with building our wallet is to go web first and then package it as mobile apps and desktop apps as well.
[51:51] Well, and speaking of eventualities, we have at least one case study in the past in which we can say eventually the Apple people relent and allow the Dash app into their app store,
[52:03] as happened with the Dash, the DCG issued Dash mobile wallet in the past. I think that'll be likely that they'll, it will eventually get through, but it might
[52:15] take a little while. Yeah, cool.
[52:17] All right. Well, yeah, so I'm super looking forward to this, you know, auditing process that you
[52:25] said needs to happen being completed. And, and I think that the idea to start integrating this Maya stuff into the incubator web wallet
[52:32] and then further wallets afterward is a great idea. And then, yeah, the, the notion of like a community run bonding node that is, um, that
[52:41] that could potentially, yeah, I hadn't thought of that. So yeah, and just one thing about the security audit, I don't necessarily, I'm not necessarily
[52:50] suggesting that we go and pay some, some firm to do a third party audit. I mostly mean like having people that developers in our community to have some, take some time
[53:03] to look at it and look at, um, and to use it. So the best auditing that you can have is to just, you know, open it up and, um, have
[53:15] people try to lose some money. Yeah.
[53:17] Exposed to losing some money in the real world. But just using it, uh, to a small degree for, for quite a while first.
[53:25] So that's, that for sure is at least what we would want to do. I mean, we're open to having, uh, an actual audit, but it's one of those things where
[53:35] it's like, do you have money for it? Okay.
[53:38] Right on. All right.
[53:40] Well, that does it for us today. Children.
[53:43] Thanks for tuning in and we look forward to seeing you next week. Thanks again.
[53:49] Yeah. Bye.
