Discussion of Dash Improvement Proposals and current funding proposals for Incubator and Dash Core Group.

tl;dr: AJ O'Neill presents three Dash Improvement Proposals (DIPs) aimed at enhancing user experience and treating Dash more like digital cash. Ryan Taylor discusses the current funding situation, proposing that his strategist proposal for 800 Dash and DCG's supplemental proposal for 650 Dash both be supported to ensure the survival of both organizations.

00:00 - Introduction and Overview of Episode
The episode begins with an introduction, followed by an overview of the topics to be discussed: Dash Improvement Proposals (DIPs) from AJ O'Neill and current funding proposals from Incubator and Dash Core Group (DCG).

05:28 - Importance of Creating and Sharing Projects
Ryan Taylor emphasizes the importance of creating and sharing projects, inviting individuals and organizations beyond DCG and Incubator to participate in the DIP process.

11:39 - Dash Improvement Proposal: Locale-Based User-Friendly Significant Digits
AJ O'Neill presents the first DIP, which proposes using locale-based significant digits to enhance user experience and treat Dash more like digital cash.

25:13 - Dash Improvement Proposal: Stamped Denominations
The second DIP focuses on stamped denominations, ensuring that when users send money, the receiver gets the same denominated value without losing any meaningful amount.

33:05 - Dash Improvement Proposal: Enforcing Transaction Hygiene
The third DIP addresses the need to enforce transaction hygiene by fixing security vulnerabilities and avoiding the use of the term "privacy features" to prevent negative perceptions.

41:35 - Current Funding Proposals for Incubator and Dash Core Group
Ryan Taylor presents the current funding situation, discussing the potential consequences of a proposal to divert Incubator funds to DCG and proposing a solution to support both organizations.

[00:00] [MUSIC] In the first Star Wars movie, well, rebranded to be the fourth, the archvillain, Darth Vader's boss,
[00:10] was Grand Moff Tarkin. Tarkin's attempts to solidify the power of the Galactic Empire through coercion was ultimately his undoing. As Princess Leia told him, "The more you tighten
[00:19] your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers." The same analogy can be applied to DC-based regulators and their haphazard actions toward the crypto industry
[00:29] as of late. Case in point, the targeting of the BZX protocol by regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC. Years prior, the coding duo of Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner created
[00:39] BZX protocol, which was built on Ethereum and used the BZRX token. By integrating with user wallets and existing exchanges, it became the first decentralized margin lending and trading
[00:49] platform on the Ethereum mainnet. It was this trading platform functionality that attracted the ire of the CFTC. The CFTC crew contested that Bean and Kistner, through their BZX protocol,
[00:59] violated the Commodity Exchange Act and sued them. And in September of 2022, Bean and Kistner were ordered to pay a fine, ransom, of a quarter million dollars and were told to cease and
[01:09] desist from violating CFTC regulations. But the BZX protocol continued unabated because a year prior, back in August of 2021, Bean and Kistner had transferred control of it to the UKIDAO.
[01:19] The administrator keys that accessed and controlled the operation of the smart contracts and the funds held in those smart contracts were henceforth controlled by token holders.
[01:27] So after the September ruling against Bean and Kistner, the CFTC crew announced their suit against UKIDAO, which they said was unlawfully acting as a futures commission merchant. To be clear,
[01:37] no specific individual was named, just UKIDAO. The targeting of a DAO was questioned and lombasted by many in the crypto sphere. Jake Stravinsky, lawyer and head of policy at the U.S. Blockchain Association,
[01:47] said that the enforcement action may be the most egregious example of regulation by enforcement in the history of crypto. But how exactly does one target a DAO, an organization that has no head,
[01:56] no headquarters, no leadership, not even a registered agent? Indeed, the CFTC crew acknowledged that they were unable to identify key figures attached to the DAO. So they asked William Oreck
[02:05] III, the person overseeing this legal action, if it'd be sufficient to post notice on the UKIDAO discussion forum and chat box. Oreck agreed that this manner of service was sufficient,
[02:15] though months later, upon learning that Bean and Kistner were likely holders of UKIDAO tokens, compelled them to be served directly, claiming then that the steps taken were practicable under
[02:23] the circumstances and applicable to the entire DAO structure. UKIDAO was given until January 2023 to respond, but did not. How could it? The DAO was set up to interact via smart contracts. Further,
[02:33] why would someone want to step forward and self-dox? And even if someone did, how could that one person represent everyone else? It was the DAO. And the targeting of UKIDAO received pushback
[02:42] from a most unlikely source, one of the five commissioners of the CFTC, Summer Mersinger, Hermann Greip, that her colleagues were operating outside their prescribed authority. And this CFTC
[02:51] crew is attempting just that, to regulate via enforcement. Ultimately, Oreck sided with the CFTC crew. He said that UKIDAO had violated three separate provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act
[03:00] and so should be penalized for three separate violations, which amounted to over $643,000. Lawyers Linda Butler and Christopher Kastens put forth that there remains uncertainty of how and
[03:10] whether the CFTC will successfully enforce the judgment. Oreck also dictated that UKIDAO cease operations and take down its website. And in one area, Oreck went even further than the CFTC crew
[03:20] requested. Oreck said he not only agreed with the CFTC crew's assessment that any token holder who voted could be considered part of the UKIDAO, but that those who abstained from voting were part of
[03:29] the DAO as well. The CFTC crew issued a press release calling Oreck's decision a sweeping victory. That the precedent-setting decision held that UKIDAO is a person under the Commodities
[03:39] Exchange Act and thus can be held liable for violations of the law. Ian McKinley, head of CFTC's Enforcement Division said, "This decision should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who
[03:48] believes they can circumvent the law by adopting a DAO structure, intending to insulate themselves from law enforcement and ultimately putting the public at risk." But who exactly was at risk?
[03:56] This type of language is just a red herring used to try to obscure. At most, regulators are upset because their claimed authority was never recognized. As CFTC employee Gretchen Lau
[04:06] emphasized, "Margined, leveraged, or financial digital asset trading offered to retail U.S. customers must occur on properly registered and regulated exchanges in accordance with all
[04:14] applicable laws and regulations. These requirements apply equally to entities with more traditional business structures as well as to DAOs." Perhaps the biggest impact of the UKIDAO case is the
[04:23] precedent it sets. At this point, they just want the precedent of getting some type of judgment against a DAO. It greenlights the continued harassment of crypto endeavors by regulators.
[04:33] But in the end, does that even matter? Or is this just a last gasp of institutional actors that are struggling to remain legitimate? As Masha Prusso wrote on Cointelegraph,
[04:41] "Such actions are likely to simply encourage developers to create programs that are even more resistant to existing laws. The impossibility of complying with existing legislation can leave
[04:50] them with little other choices. The path forward is quite clear. All protocols moving forward may have to be fully decentralized." Indeed, even though Orrick implies that his and the CFTC
[04:59] crew's actions stopped UKIDAO, the protocol is still operational. Sure, the old website and forum are no longer accessible, but the protocol is arguably now even more untouchable as it's
[05:08] been migrated to IPFS. By trying to grow their clout, they are losing it. By trying to command from the top down, innovation is emerging from the bottom up, and humanity is better off for it.
[05:28] Good day, good day, good day. Welcome to Incubator Weekly. How's it going, Ryan and AJ? Pretty good.
[05:34] Good. So glad I'm not accidentally muted right now. That was an issue last week. So everybody, today we are bringing to you a multi-part show. Of course, according to today's title,
[05:48] we are going to be discussing not the entirety of, but a portion of the dips that have recently been submitted by developer AJ O'Neill. And then afterward, Ryan is going to speak with us a bit
[06:05] about the current funding proposals coming from both the incubator and DCG in the current treasury cycle. So before we move into either of those two things, Ryan has a few comments just about
[06:18] the notion of dips coming from outside DCG in general. So tell us about that, Ryan. Yeah, I wanted to thank AJ for taking the initiative to do some of these dips, because
[06:35] we had talked about it many, many months ago, but it was just one of those things where there was a little bit of a miscommunication about whether that was approved work or not. But in the end,
[06:46] I think this is some of the most important work. One thing I've learned in the incubator is that specification work is some of the hardest work. And it's also, it's some of the hardest work,
[07:04] especially if you try to do it before you actually have worked with the implementation. And so one of the things that I do in the incubator with AJ specifically is,
[07:16] we go straight to implementation a lot of times. And the reason is because you don't really know what you want until you've tried to actually build it sometimes. And so once you've tried
[07:29] to build it for a little bit, then you realize it starts to solidify in your head what it is that you're actually getting to. And then it's the time to specify it more formally. And that's,
[07:46] I think, what we've done. And we're going to talk about that in more detail, obviously. But I just wanted to say, the DIP process, it kind of seems a little bit like this is just
[07:59] something that DCG does, because that is something that only DCG has done up until this point, I believe. But I also want to send the invitation out to organizations and individuals beyond DCG
[08:14] and incubator to try this process of writing DIPs. It doesn't have to be as thorough as you might think. It's not this huge endeavor that needs to be perfect. Just try it. Just give it
[08:33] a stab if you have an idea about how you-- They are a lot shorter than I thought they'd be. When I read through them, they're short. In fact, the shorter, the better, as far as I'm
[08:43] concerned. In my former life as a mechanical engineer, I used to do technical writing and documents for manufacturing facilities on how they could save energy and whatnot.
[08:54] And the one thing I learned with that is the shorter, the better also. Get to the point right away. Make it very clear. Make it very obvious. You're not writing a report to write a report.
[09:07] You're writing a report to convince people. And people don't have time to read a 20-page document, although some of my engineering reports ended up being much longer than that with all the
[09:18] figures and stuff. But yeah, you have a very small report and then a big appendix is basically what it turned out to be. But yeah, I'd like to open that up. The DIP process should be something that
[09:31] community members can do. You just have to basically give a motivation and then you don't even necessarily have to have the specification right off the bat. You can hand that over to
[09:43] somebody like the incubator or maybe DCG can help you specify it if you don't know exactly the technical details. But everybody has ideas about how to improve DASH, and that's what these
[09:54] are, DASH Improvement Proposals. You don't have to be the expert. You just have to be somebody who has an idea and you think that you can improve DASH. So I might be writing some of these
[10:08] in the future about economic issues. But let's get on to what we have on hand now that we're 10 minutes in already. Okay, we're ready for you, AJ. Ask me a question.
[10:20] What is the process for, and this is maybe for Ryan or AJ, this is just an elementary question, when one submits a DIP, whose role is it to say yes, this is going into the code next round or
[10:39] no, this is rejected? Is that like on DCG? Do they look outward? Is it really just anybody who releases the code base, which I guess could be someone who forks it? How does that work, Ryan?
[10:53] That's a good question. I don't know if anybody really knows the answer to these questions. That's why it's fun that we're doing it. I think what it boils down to is probably DCG will
[11:05] probably review them at some point, hopefully soon-ish. And then if there's something that's like controversial, then it might end up going to a governance proposal to the network. And then
[11:18] we'll have to give the technical arguments on the pro and the con side of and then have masternode owners try to evaluate that. But it kind of depends on the nature of the DIP, I think.
[11:30] Okay. Well, AJ, let's start by taking a look at locale-based, user-friendly significant digits. Shall I bring it up or do you want to?
[11:39] You go ahead and bring it up. I don't have my screen sharing set up today. Wow. That was unanticipated. I did not think that day would ever come. Please give me just a moment
[11:49] to pull up my share screen. Share screen. Don't show these tips again. Show me this and show the tab. And here we go. Okay. So I guess tell me what you want me to do. Yeah.
[12:06] Well, I could just give an overview of this. Maybe you can scroll down to the abstract. I think that the abstract is actually quite clear in this. So there should be... Do you not see
[12:19] a... It looks like you don't see the preview. Refresh the page. You should see a link to the preview. There you go. Preview. Okay.
[12:32] I added that while we were talking so it would go directly to it. Okay. All right. So yeah, if you just take a look at the abstract there,
[12:39] zoom in on that a little bit, maybe make your window less wide and maybe it'll zoom in automatically or there's also some stuff there. I know I've seen you guys do this via hot keys
[12:49] a million times, but will you tell me how to zoom in? Command plus or control plus. Control plus. Is that good? Yeah. Hit that a couple more times. That's really tiny still.
[13:01] Oh, it's big enough for me. Oh, there you go. Yeah. And if you could make the window bigger this way, that would probably help too, because it's small like this. Well, I'm assuming you can
[13:14] see what I can see. Anyway. So the main issue here is that... Well, this is multilayered. So I'll just ramble and you direct me. But when I give someone a dollar, they receive a dollar.
[13:30] They don't receive less than a dollar. The dollar isn't worth less than a dollar by virtue of the fact of me giving it to them. And when they give it to someone else, they also receive a dollar.
[13:44] So this proposal in isolation does not encompass the vision that I have. And I think a lot of people, a lot is a relative term, but at least several people also have this vision that Dash
[14:02] would behave like digital cash. And so as long as we're showing eight decimal places, you've probably seen a lot of bickering and arguing about literally amounts that are so small
[14:17] that we can't measure them in any practical way. So you have to take a monetary unit and you have to decide what of this is actually spendable. And you could probably make an argument in most
[14:32] locales that you can spend a millidash. So 0.001 Dash is a spendable unit. Well, actually, I don't think that's true. I think a spendable unit would be 0.01 Dash in most locales. I don't think that
[14:50] anything below that could you actually have any purchasing power. Which we see here Kraken does, right? You say here that Kraken does not honor Dash less than 0.01. Yes. And I think that Kraken
[15:06] is taking an incorrect approach on this, probably due to legacy reasons based on some of their code base. I had a little bit of back and forth with their customer support on what I perceived to be
[15:16] as bugs. But it turned out, well, they did fix one of them, that aside. So what I give as an example is a bottle of water. So a bottle of water is essentially nothing. You're buying nothing. You're
[15:32] buying something that in most places in the world is essentially free. A bottle of water represents the cost of overhead, because there's no realizable cost of the product. So it's the
[15:48] shipping, it's the marketing, it's the housing it in the store, having a place on the shelf. A bottle of water is the cost of nothing. If I wanted to sell you nothing, there is a cost
[16:00] for me to sell you nothing. Because that nothing, it has to get shipped, it has to have a label, it has to have a place to be put, et cetera. So I give that example of a bottle of water kind
[16:10] of being the thing that is the cheapest thing that you can buy that isn't really much of a thing. And so in the US, a dollar is kind of our smallest unit of purchasing power. But it kind of makes
[16:28] sense to subdivide it, because some things you can make an argument that, well, this is really worth a dollar and a half. It's worth a purchasing unit and a half. But you're not really going to
[16:39] make the argument that this is worth less than a purchasing unit, at least not for a retail product. And if you go down below a dime, then there's just no argument to be made. There's nothing,
[16:53] there's the only argument when it comes down to pennies is really making a number look pretty. And you see this at the gas station in the United States where gas is $2.099. Well,
[17:07] we don't have millidollars, but gas is priced in millidollars. So there is this marketing sexiness of adding extra digits to things, especially if they end in a nine or a seven,
[17:25] there's some psychological perception of that, whatever. The numbers themselves aren't useful in terms of communicating exchange of value. They might be useful in terms of an aesthetic
[17:38] or in terms of a psychological effect, but they're not useful in terms of communicating an exchange of value. So in Dash, eight digits is obviously way too much to effectively communicate
[17:55] exchange of value, especially because I'm not familiar of any locale in which we designate sections of a number that are in a decimal place. So if you want a thousand, we put a comma after
[18:12] the one, or in some places I think they put a period or... Oh, so true. Yeah. It's standard that things will be divided by the three numbers. Yeah. And then in applications, you'll see things
[18:25] like maybe the leading digits are black, but then the trailing digits are gray, or the trailing digits are smaller, or like what you see at the gas station where the extra nine that they tack
[18:37] on is in a superscript. So in daily life, there are ways that people communicate what the important number is versus what the psychological fluff is. And we need something like that for Dash,
[18:52] if it's going to work like digital cash. And back to my original argument, is that we need something where the value that you send and receive feels equal. So if I send you 0.999 Dash, there's going
[19:08] to be trailing Dash on that, right? So if I send that to you, you can send it to someone else and they'll still get 0.999 Dash. And then they could send that to someone else and they would still get
[19:23] 0.999 Dash. And so you could do that many, many times where you send a single coin over and over and over again, and that coin would retain a value of 0.999 for a very long time. Okay.
[19:39] I want to jump in here and just comment on something in general. First of all, we probably don't have enough time to make the case for each of these dips on the show here. We're going to
[19:53] present them as things that we should look at later. But I also wanted to mention that if you haven't already been watching AJ's streams, what you'll notice and what these dips are
[20:08] coming from is that AJ is trying to use Dash in the real world and with a focus on user experience. So that's kind of the broad motivation for all of these things is, you know, these have come up
[20:25] in the process of building payment tools and merchant tools because AJ intends to actually have businesses running and accepting Dash and paying in Dash and using it as cash,
[20:41] like digital cash. That is our main brand. So while I don't know, I actually haven't reviewed these in detail personally, and I don't know if I agree on 100% on them or minor parts of them.
[20:55] The general idea is that these are motivated by people like building merchant tools from built by merchants from for merchants, essentially like AJ's in the role of both a
[21:10] merchant and a user. And these are the things that he's come across as like, I want to feel like I'm sending cash. That's a totally legitimate motivation. And that's what I think a lot of
[21:23] this is coming from. So let's, let's, let's keep the details about each dip a little bit lighter on the next two. And just know that like, that's the context that this whole thing is coming from
[21:33] is making people want to use this. And that's not a very like you need to have technical solutions so that people feel better about using your product, that there's just so much about that.
[21:50] So much of success in an industry is not necessarily the technical superiority, but just how users feel when they're using it. And that's why I think what's motivating this to a large
[22:06] extent. Is that right? AJ? Yeah. And so to, to this one, I think is the one that I have the most to say about, because there are so many other things that once we decide we want to treat this
[22:22] like cash to a user, first of all, just that mentality period that we're actually committed to being digital cash and not committed to being just another random pyramid scheme.
[22:35] If we're actually committed to being digital cash, we need to make decisions that, that feel like that, like the digital equivalent of cash. And when we make the decision of how many digits to
[22:49] show to the user, that means that we've got some wiggle room to play with those legacy digits to fix other problems. And so I think that this is the most important first step, although on its own,
[23:03] it's not really that meaningful, but if we decide oh, and then the, because we, we, we can bicker and argue all day long about, should it be two digits? Should it be three digits? Should it be
[23:15] four digits? This proposes a locale based, based on and I don't have something perfect for this yet, but I think there could be something more perfect than what I presented, but based on
[23:28] something like the lowest cost of a transaction fee. So if you wanted to send money via another platform in the local denomination, because nothing denominates with dash locally, as far as
[23:39] I'm aware, you know, what's the lowest unit and in the United States, that's typically a dollar. I don't think you can send someone less than a dollar via PayPal or Venmo or, you know, bank
[23:49] transfer. Like there's, there's, it's about a dollar in the United States somewhere else. It might be something else, but if you could take that unit, convert it into dash, whatever the,
[23:59] the, the base spendable unit, not the fractional unit, but the base unit that's necessary to buy something that is essentially nothing like a bottle of water, which in the United States is a
[24:10] dollar. If you were to take that and then convert that to dash, and then divide that, add, divide that by 10 and add one of those units. And the reason for this is that it rolls over because if
[24:26] you end up with a 0.9, you've essentially ended up with a one, but if you've been ended up with a 0.8, then there's an argument there that that fraction is actually useful. But anyway, so you
[24:36] take that, you divide that by 10 and whatever that is, that's the number of decimal places that should be thrown or shown almost universally. That's going to be three digits of dash. There
[24:46] might be some third world countries where that extends out to four digits of dash, but it, but, but pretty much everywhere in the developed world where people have enough technology to be able to
[24:57] use dash, that's probably going to be three digits. And so. And then on this second dip here, the stamped denominations, how does that one come into play? Okay. So the stamped denominations
[25:13] is so right now we, when we send money, we, we don't send it the way that you send it via Venmo or PayPal or with a person, we have all of these extra digits. So if we first accept that we're
[25:29] going to denominate, you know, let's say that we don't really truly denominate, but we just set the number of digits. Well, now when I send money to someone, they need to receive the amount
[25:42] of money that I've sent. And when we look at the way as specifically, I'm pulling out the coin join, cause that's the only case where we have actual denominations right now, coin join doesn't stamp
[25:55] the denominations in a meaningful way. So coin join has it, it has four zeros and then a one in this, as far as I've, and no one's argued with me about this. And I would expect that if I was not
[26:08] correct on this, I mean, one of the, one of the ways I get information is I make an assertion. The best way to get information is if you make a wrong assertion, people are going to pounce and
[26:16] say, no, that's wrong. So I've made the assertion that coin join is the way that it is because it's cute. And I've made this on Twitter and in several different of the discord channels and whatnot.
[26:27] And I've looked at the code and, and it literally looks like the reason these numbers were chosen is because they're cute and no other reason. Well, there was something about bit shifting
[26:38] also, right? Yeah. Yes. Cause it, well, it's a cute, it's like a computer science joke. Almost. It's the way that the coin join denominations are is, is almost programmer humor, essentially it's,
[26:49] it's to be cute. It's to be funny. It doesn't have a practical reason. So if you have a denomination of one in coin join, it does have enough sats at the end to be spendable for a
[27:06] transaction fee. The denomination of 0.1 does not the denomination of 0.01 does not. And the denomination of 0.001 does not. So the stamps, you know, and I call it stamp. I don't think it's
[27:19] officially referenced this way, but a stamp is the extra amount of money that's on a thing in order to transact it. Right. Like in order to send a letter, I put a stamp on it in order to send the
[27:32] money. It has to be stamped with a fee. So that aren't, you know, over 20 years old, we used to send letters in, in, in mailboxes. And then the letter carrier had to make sure there was a stamp
[27:45] on them. That was their fee. And AJ, what is the, what is the notion of dash wasted? What is that? So, okay. First of all, some of this is wrong and I actually need to update this. So that's one of
[27:57] the ones that's wrong. So actually let's not, let's not discuss that because I gotta, I gotta take that out. But there is some amount of waste in the dash to, to put it in simple terms that
[28:10] without getting into specifics that are incorrect numbers, there's some amount of dash that's wasted when you denominate and when you spend something that's denominated. So if I, if I go
[28:20] to spend a denominated one dash, I'm losing some amount of money that is not useful to me and is not useful to the receiver. Like the amount that's not big enough to be denominated. The,
[28:34] that starts in, I guess the 0.000 and then that digit, that's the wasted stuff. Yeah. Yeah. It sits in the wallet, right? It can never be mixed. Well, and it's, and when it's attached to the
[28:47] coin or when you put a transaction through, you waste, you, you quote unquote, donate it to the network, but it's not meaningful to the network. It's not enough of a payment to have any effect
[28:58] on someone's ability to pay their server bill. It's not meaningful to me and it's not meaningful to the person receiving it. So it's, it's essentially a number that has to be, something
[29:09] has to be done with it. And the default behavior is to donate it to the network, which means that the person who receives the money that I sent does not actually have the transaction fees included in
[29:19] the money that I sent. So they cannot send it again at the same denominated value. And part of this is the way the code is structured is it detects how many times something's been mixed
[29:31] by the way that it goes back to one of these values that can't, it, it's again, it's kind of like a cutesy programmer humor type of thing where when I look at it, I'm thinking really like what,
[29:45] but that's, that's a different ball of wax. The idea here is that when we send money, first of all, let's have denominations. I don't think that should be limited to CoinJoin. I think in general,
[29:57] that's a good user experience, what denominations eventually afford you, but that the denominations have to be stamped with more than enough to transact it. So let's say that I don't think
[30:10] that a fixed amount is the right approach. I think the right approach is to take the leftover stuff that would be donated to the network and just reapply that to the coins that are being sent.
[30:20] But when I receive, if I receive one dash, I think everybody who's used Dash has had this experience where you've received one dash or 0.1 dash, a friend's trying to get you into Dashly,
[30:31] they send 0.1 dash to you, but then you can't spend 0.1 dash. You can only spend 0.99 dash. And the way that we like to price things, individual to individual, not business to
[30:44] business, individual to individual, you don't spend, you don't buy something from your friend for 1.99 or 2.99, you do one or two. And so you have this psychological feeling, I would imagine
[30:59] most people have this, that you didn't get the value you were promised. And so by- I've definitely had that happen. When I made a withdrawal of a whole number and I got 0.9999s,
[31:11] I had to tell myself, it's really not that much less, but oh, it kind of still hurts. It gives you a little anxiety.
[31:17] Yeah. And so if we denominated and add stamp values to the denomination, especially where there's so many transactions where Dash would be wasted, that we can just reapply the wasted
[31:31] Dash or donated Dash across the coins. I think that we need to do something about the whole fee structure, but that's a totally different conversation. Something we could do for user
[31:41] experience today, or maybe not today, but in the next month would be to apply the dust across the coin so that the amount the person receives on the other end, they can spend for the same value.
[31:57] And that could continue fairly indefinitely if we were to implement this specification. Although I would imagine there are tweaks that we need to make to it, but that's what could be done
[32:13] here is we could alleviate that psychological burden if I didn't receive the value. But first, we have to truncate the digits. We have to say, we're only going to show three digits,
[32:22] but when you send money, you can only select three digits you're going to send, but more money is going to actually go to the person than those three digits. And then their software is going
[32:32] to be able to use that to pay the fee. So if you send somebody 1.000 Dash, the software would actually select to send them 1.0001 Dash, but that is going to enable that money to be re-spent
[32:50] without losing the actual value, the denominated value. Okay. All right. So then I will go ahead and now that we have a decent idea about that, we'll move into the third dip.
[33:05] And this we're calling enforcing transaction hygiene. Yeah.
[33:16] Again, if you could make that window bigger, it's a very small sliver. If you told me how, I will do it.
[33:28] Well, can you not just resize the window to make it taller? Like, okay. So just shrink my whole, yes. Does that?
[33:37] Okay. That's a bit, that's a split the difference on that and then zoom out one because now. Okay. So then is that control minus?
[33:48] I don't know what is going on. I don't know what it looks like on your screen, but it's.
[33:54] I can't believe we're doing this live. Whatever it's it's nevermind.
[33:59] It works. So one of the, I think one of the biggest issues in the Dash community
[34:07] is a misunderstanding of quote unquote privacy features. So the justification for CoinJoin, which I think that CoinJoin is,
[34:20] well, it's absolutely a symptom of a problem. It's not a solution. CoinJoin is adding a quote unquote privacy feature,
[34:30] but it's a privacy feature that's redundant because we have security vulnerabilities. If we fix the security vulnerabilities, then we wouldn't need quote unquote privacy features.
[34:41] And I think that privacy features are going to attract malicious actors to construct stories and spin content that is going to put Dash in a negative light.
[34:54] That's very easy to believe. And that's not going to help our cause.
[34:59] So I'm going to, I'm going to try to translate this into, from AJ speak into what I understand this to be.
[35:06] Yeah, go ahead. We in the Dash community and in cryptocurrency in general,
[35:12] talk a lot about the importance of privacy, privacy, privacy, privacy, between people like customer and merchant, but also between things like
[35:23] individual and government. And what AJ is suggesting is we're using the wrong term.
[35:31] We're giving them ground. We're giving them a noose to hang ourselves with.
[35:36] Yes. If we, if we continue to call this a privacy concern,
[35:40] then bad actors, in other words, governments, they will use that and say, these people want privacy.
[35:47] They must be doing something bad and evil and wicked and nasty. But if we call this thing a security vulnerability,
[35:54] then it's clear that we're just, we're just trying to improve the security of a product, which shouldn't be controversial at all.
[36:04] And it's more than that. It's more than that because Coinjoin doesn't fix a security vulnerability.
[36:12] We have security vulnerabilities, which are the reason that Coinjoin exists. We, we leak transaction information that we should not be leaking in the first place.
[36:23] Right. One of those vulnerabilities, the, the, the leaking of personally identifying
[36:31] or transactionally identifying information is the security vulnerability. And if we can, if we can solve that so that we're not leaking that, that data,
[36:44] then we will get the privacy that we wanted in the first place. But it's just calling it a different thing.
[36:51] It's, it's a different perspective on the same problem. And it's a different, not just a different perspective, but a different approach.
[36:59] So if you look at the protocol layer and my goal isn't to be maximally compatible with BTC code, but to be maximally digital cash, that's, that's a, that's a different technical
[37:16] approach. And so there's actually, this is, I came up with this while I was recognizing that some
[37:23] transactions were leaking information about the sender and receiver. And as I was doing the dip, I found out that my approach that I was using to overcome this
[37:34] was actually in a way incorrect. Not that it was technically invalid, but that there has already been a BIP for this since
[37:45] before Dash came into existence. A BIP with a B, as in it came, like there was something from, from Bitcoin that was
[37:53] trying to address. Pardon your French, but yes.
[37:55] Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[37:56] You don't like to use that term because it, yeah. Well, because yeah, it just, it just SEO hijacks so many things, but, but yeah.
[38:05] So there's, there's actually a BIP that addresses this, but it was never adopted and enforced in the Dash code or it's adapted, it's adopted in some Dash code.
[38:19] So for example, I believe that it's actually adopted for the code that does CoinJoin transactions, because when I went back to prove my case, I just pulled some transactions
[38:28] at random and I found, wait a minute, these transactions actually follow that BIP. And it seems like, I don't know, maybe it could be a 50/50 split.
[38:37] It's, it's somewhere between one third and two thirds. I'm not sure, you know, it's, it's not like 90% versus 10%.
[38:43] It's somewhere in the one third to two third range. So let's say 50/50.
[38:47] If you just pull transactions at random, you'll see that maybe half of them are leaking information about the transaction.
[38:54] And of those that aren't, leaking information that's not necessary, because there's some amount, this is a public ledger.
[39:03] There's some amount of leakiness that we can't overcome with the current confines of, of, you know, making an incremental change to the protocol or to the software.
[39:15] This is something that with an incremental change, we can, we can patch the vulnerability without having, you know, a big change.
[39:24] And essentially what I'm, what I'm suggesting here is reiterating what the other BIP said, because I started working on this.
[39:30] I was detailing the way that I had solved the problem. When I realized there was already a BIP for it, then I reworked it to detail the way that
[39:40] they're solving the problem. And basically we need to up our version number on packets and packets that have the higher
[39:47] version number need to be rejected if they don't fix this. And we need to have some sort of recording mechanism so that for packets that exist in
[39:57] the wild, that may exist in the wild for years, there's some way to flag a report or somehow get feedback back to the user.
[40:05] Hey, you've got an outdated version of software. Hey, this is leaking information about you.
[40:09] Dang. Okay.
[40:14] Okay. Again, this is just a conversation starter.
[40:17] We, we haven't given enough information in this short, whatever, 40 minute with three dips.
[40:25] And there are more, more dips that we haven't discussed as well that we'll probably discuss next week, but definitely not enough information in this short show to convince anybody of
[40:37] even the problem, let alone the solutions proposed. So yes, that was just an introduction.
[40:45] Do you have anything else to say in general on the dip things, AJ, or should we move into what I was going to present at the end here?
[40:55] My parting words would be, decide, do you want to be furthering the cause of digital cash or are you a Bitcoin maximalist in disguise?
[41:10] Yeah. This is about SEO, AJ.
[41:16] All right. Pardon my French.
[41:18] Pardon my French. Okay.
[41:22] I'm trying to share my screen at the moment, so I guess we'll just do entire screen. That's probably the easiest way to go.
[41:29] Does that work? Yep.
[41:35] Yeah, sorry about that little infinite Zoom thing there. So right now, Incubator's got three proposals out, and there was an additional proposal
[41:54] that came up. So right here, what you're seeing is the way that I track the proposal system and kind
[42:02] of model scenarios and whatnot. The way that I do this, just in case anybody's interested, is I go to this wonderful site,
[42:10] mnowatch.org/leaderboard, and I basically just copy and paste this data just like this, and I paste it into the spreadsheet.
[42:22] And the only thing it does is it helps to calculate some of these allocations and the total votes and the approval rating and whether or not 10% has been achieved.
[42:36] And then you can kind of toggle whether proposals are passing or not, whatever you want to model in a scenario.
[42:44] And obviously, if anybody's not paying attention, the wild curveball that's been thrown is this proposal to divert Incubator funds to DCG, and that's asking for $1,150, which is essentially
[43:03] the sum of the amounts that the three Incubator proposals have requested, $800, $150, and $200 from Strategist Ryan, SpectraProd, and Ash, respectively.
[43:16] So the idea here is, hey, DCG's in trouble. We need to basically cancel all funding to the Incubator and send it to DCG instead.
[43:27] Now, I don't know how serious people are going to and are taking this proposal. I think there are some serious consequences if we go down this route.
[43:38] But never getting anything done or shipped. Well, from the Incubator, yeah.
[43:46] No, from DCG. Like if all the funds are going to an organization that can't produce anything of value.
[43:53] Fightin' words from AJ. I'm trying to be a little more diplomatic.
[43:58] But yeah, it's a valid thing to say, for sure, or at least to claim. Tell me if I should mute him, Ryan.
[44:05] Let's keep going. No, no, he's fine.
[44:07] I'm okay with this. The solution that we've come up with, I've spoken with Sam about this and what we should
[44:15] do, and I just wanted to say what the risks are of this. If anybody who's familiar with the proposal system knows that when there are two competing
[44:24] proposals where they're mutually exclusive, what happens in practice is that people that support the one proposal will vote yes for that thing, and then they'll vote no for the
[44:35] other thing. And so if both proposals are relatively equally, or even relatively equally supported, then
[44:43] what happens is neither proposal passes. So even by the standards laid out by this lysergic fellow, even by his standards of
[44:52] wanting to help DCG out, this proposal's not actually doing that, because the most likely scenario is that neither of these proposals would pass, and that this 1150- would just
[45:02] be not given to either organization, and both organizations would struggle. Incubator, obviously, like a fatal blow, and DCG would have significantly less funds to
[45:15] work with. Now, it's possible that this could pass, and if that's the case, what happens?
[45:21] Let's just model that. DCG passes, none of the incubator proposals pass, and we have- this is actually- DCG hasn't
[45:35] submitted a supplemental proposal, but they typically do, and I've modeled this at 300 if this divert incubator funds passes.
[45:43] And what happens there is you have 3.2 Dash left over in this scenario, and 94% of the funds in the whole Dash ecosystem are going to DCG.
[45:54] So is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing?
[45:57] You decide. I think it's a terrible thing.
[46:02] So what we've come up with is we've talked with DCG, with Sam, and basically what I'm asking is MNOs, if you want to support both organizations maximally, what we've done is
[46:19] I'm modeling that MNOs would not support this proposal by Tim SpectorProd, and Ash has actually officially withdrawn his proposal, and in some sense, we've withdrawn both of these
[46:34] proposals, but I'm still requesting this 800 Dash, and then I'm saying, "DCG, please request 650 in your supplemental proposal instead of just the 300 that would be left
[46:47] otherwise," because DCG, typically, they don't like to step on toes, and they only request in their supplemental what hasn't actually been requested that would fill up
[46:56] the superblock, so they would have only requested 300, all other things equal, unless we had talked about this and said, "Hey, actually, we'd be better off.
[47:07] We'd both be better off if you request 650 Dash, and we'll just assume that Masternode owners are going to be smart enough to vote these two proposals down but support this
[47:19] proposal for 800 Dash going to the incubator." Now, what that does is that keeps us alive through the end of the quarter, at least,
[47:27] and then we can reassess the situation at the end of the quarter for our next quarterly proposals.
[47:33] This gives DCG a little bit more funds to work with, and if I flip over here to ... This is our incubator accounting model, and I've hidden some columns that aren't relevant to
[47:48] the discussion here, right here, but we typically include those in our proposals, and then I've added another column here.
[47:55] I won't explain all this in detail, but what I've basically done is I've modeled ... If this goes as I hope it goes, and this 800 Dash proposal is funded and these ones aren't,
[48:10] then Ash and Tim, they can continue working on the buffers that they have, so Ash has 1,893 Dash and left in his buffer, Inspector Pratt has 401, I have 980.
[48:21] If I can get this funding for 800 Dash, then we will have these buffers going through the various months, so this is July, this is August, this is September, and as you can see, we
[48:36] still have some buffer to work with, and it gets us through this quarter. Now, I've also modeled this for DCG, and this comment is actually outdated.
[48:48] I have better numbers that are right here now, so I'll update that comment, but please don't take this for truth.
[48:58] This isn't DCG's model. This is incubator's model for what we feel like is the latest information that we have
[49:07] on DCG's financial information. I don't think that they published this.
[49:11] I think Sam mentioned that it would be okay to have this aggregate data shared because the network should know what the financial situation is, and you can see this date here
[49:23] basically says with these assumptions, this is the 650 supplemental proposal being modeled as passing, and what that does to their financial situation is it extends it through something
[49:41] like early to mid-November, but that's assuming the 650 continues, and we don't know what's going to happen in the next quarter.
[49:58] Each of us has to reassess at the end of these quarters, and price has a lot to do with this, obviously, so if you bump this up to 50, then the situation looks a lot better, and now
[50:09] DCG's funded through April of next year, for example, but I had to make this because it's obvious that we need to work together in order to both survive and not get in a situation
[50:26] where incubators are requesting too much of the funding. I didn't know that DCG was in as bad of a situation as it's clear that they are now,
[50:37] so now that I've got... Is there no quarterly reports from them or the trust protectors?
[50:43] Well, yeah, they don't have quarterly reports, but we do know now a little bit more about how much reserves they have, what their burn rate is, so I can model this and our future
[50:59] incubator proposals can keep this better in mind. I didn't have this before we submitted our proposals.
[51:06] We were just submitting proposals based on mostly our own reserve planning, but then just wanted to model one more thing just so everybody's clear.
[51:17] If this doesn't pass, either because people just don't want to pass it or lysergic's proposal passes instead, incubators toast.
[51:28] We don't have reserves to get through the end of the quarter even, so if that's what you want, do what you need to, but just hoping that people have a little bit more information
[51:41] to go from and objective data to work with. I think that's pretty much all I had to say about this.
[51:49] I don't know if anybody has any questions on the live stream, happy to answer them, but I will update our proposals, the body, the text of our proposals so that this is...
[52:05] You don't have to watch this whole video. I'll update the text of our proposals so you'll know.
[52:11] Okay, and just to make a summary, Ryan, please tell me if this is accurate. In short, what you are saying is that the two other incubator strategists have more
[52:25] or less withdrawn their proposals and that you remain the only strategist who would still like his current funding proposal to pass.
[52:34] And in addition, you are communicating that DCG has committed to asking for a supplemental of, did you say 650?
[52:44] Yeah. And that you are asking, and potentially even Sam is asking, I don't know, that both your
[52:51] proposal for 800 and DCG's supplemental proposal for 650 both be supported by the network in that there is room for both.
[53:00] Yeah? There's room for both.
[53:02] And I'm not going to speak for Sam, just he'll comment on the proposals about what he wants specifically and what he's thinking.
[53:09] Just generally speaking, I don't think that he wants Incubator to die. That's what, you know, he's always been of that opinion.
[53:18] But this wasn't, the lysergic proposal wasn't DCG's idea in the first place. So that doesn't come as a surprise.
[53:26] And I don't want, I want DCG to have more of a, enough runway to finish this product. I mean, there is the sunk cost fallacy.
[53:36] I think AJ's mentioned that. But as far as I'm concerned, I want Evolution, I want Platform to land in a completed form
[53:44] so that we can see what the market thinks about it. It may be successful, it may not be.
[53:49] But I certainly don't want one organization dominating Dash even more than it already is.
[53:57] So. Okay.
[54:00] All right. Thanks for tuning in, everybody.
[54:03] We look forward to coming back to you next week with some additional dips from AJ that we did not review today.
[54:10] And so until that time, we'll see ya. All right.
[54:15] Howdy. See ya.
[54:17] See you later, folks. Adios.
