## Chapters

### 00:00 – 05:00: Introduction and Scheduling Shift

In this opening segment, the host greets viewers and acknowledges that this week’s update is being held later than usual. They briefly explain the timing adjustments and welcome AJ back to the show. The discussion sets the stage by referencing a previous conversation about browser-based proposal creation, signaling the ongoing mission to simplify Dash tools for everyday users. Both participants reaffirm their commitment to improving Dash’s utility and share a sense of urgency in providing quality solutions that people can rely on.

They highlight the core question of how to establish a genuine Dash economy, one in which individuals earn, spend, and save Dash without constantly converting back to fiat. This transitional topic underscores the desire for a self-sustaining ecosystem. AJ’s background in developing web-based tools for Dash is presented as an integral part of this vision, leading directly into deeper explorations of technical needs. The audience learns that the next hour will focus on bridging crucial gaps between technology, usability, and real-world application.

### 05:00 – 10:00: Defining the Need for Exports

During this segment, the speakers discuss the principle that every functioning economy revolves around something valuable enough that people want to trade for it—often referred to as an export. They suggest that Dash, like any currency, must represent a unique or useful asset that individuals and businesses actively seek. The idea is that unless people have practical reasons to acquire and hold Dash, they will default to converting it into their local fiat currency.

They also note that real-world labor, products, and services must be linked to Dash transactions for the economy to be self-sustaining. The conversation touches on the gap in crypto economies where many businesses promptly convert crypto to fiat, preventing the momentum needed for long-term Dash adoption. By drawing parallels with national economies that thrive on exports, the speakers emphasize how crucial it is for developers and entrepreneurs to create tangible offerings priced in Dash, fueling a robust demand cycle for the currency.

### 10:00 – 15:00: Challenges of Keeping Dash in Circulation

In this portion, the focus turns to the hurdles faced by those who currently earn Dash but feel compelled to convert it into dollars to cover expenses. They mention that many people who receive Dash for work cannot find enough places or services to spend it directly, and thus end up liquidating their holdings. This behavior weakens the overall ecosystem, as fewer transactions remain in Dash itself.

They explore how offering web-native services could address this shortfall. Because the internet is already a hub for countless digital businesses, integrating Dash payments into web-based platforms might naturally encourage people to transact in the currency. The conversation highlights specific strategies, like ensuring easy payment flows and robust developer tooling, to reduce friction. By doing so, they aim to create a positive feedback loop where earning, spending, and reusing Dash becomes second nature for more users.

### 15:00 – 20:00: Bridging Dash with the Web

Here, the speakers explain why focusing on web integration is such a pivotal step for Dash adoption. They observe that while Dash is “internet-ready,” it isn’t necessarily “web-ready,” meaning it doesn’t yet offer smooth, standardized browser-based interactions. This gap makes life difficult for both developers and end users who expect online services to function with minimal setup and maximum convenience.

They propose that making Dash more accessible within standard web environments is key to expanding its utility. Whether it’s a cloud-based service or a simple e-commerce site, people should be able to handle payments, track balances, and manage private keys with as little hassle as possible. The ultimate goal is to streamline Dash usage so thoroughly that those new to cryptocurrencies barely notice a learning curve, thus opening the door to a broader audience and more robust economic activity.

### 20:00 – 25:00: Reviewing Active Proposals and Feedback

During these minutes, attention shifts to the proposals that AJ has introduced, which aim to facilitate web-based solutions for Dash. The host references an online leaderboard showing current proposals, noting how one suggests maintaining a web proxy for RPC calls. Another offers a dedicated web wallet and QR code explorer to enhance ease of use. They acknowledge certain misunderstandings or reservations in the community, emphasizing the need for clarity.

This discussion underscores the difficulty of conveying highly technical concepts to masternode owners, who must vote on whether to fund them. By breaking down each proposal’s potential benefits—like improved privacy tools or simplified transaction flows—they stress that better developer support can have wide-ranging impacts on overall adoption. Their hope is that clearer explanations will encourage more constructive dialogue, helping masternodes see how foundational tools support broader, innovative applications of Dash in the future.

### 25:00 – 30:00: Wallet Explorer Concept and Technical Foundations

This chapter highlights the core idea behind the Wallet Explorer and QR Code project. AJ describes how advanced diagnostics and deep technical visibility can actually simplify the developer experience. By offering a way to inspect hierarchical deterministic (HD) paths, derive addresses, and display real-time balances, the Wallet Explorer would give builders a solid grasp of Dash’s underpinnings without requiring them to master every cryptographic detail themselves.

They also compare the proposed approach to Dash Core’s existing libraries, noting that the current infrastructure doesn’t always lend itself to straightforward web implementations. By introducing specialized tools, developers could spend more time innovating and less time figuring out how to store private keys or manage multiple addresses. The conversation points to a future in which every piece of Dash’s internal architecture has a friendly, web-based interface that developers can seamlessly integrate into their own products.

### 30:00 – 35:00: Emergent Design and Usability

During this segment, the speakers explain how they arrive at user-friendly solutions by first creating working prototypes, then refining them based on real-world feedback. Rather than specifying every design element upfront, they employ an approach known as emergent design: the product evolves as new discoveries are made and practical needs become clear. This method has already been applied to earlier Dash proposals, such as the proposal creation tool, which was shaped by the actual constraints of the Dash protocol.

They further stress that design should reflect how people naturally interact with financial systems. While advanced settings are important for power users, the default experience must be straightforward. The conversation returns to the notion that bridging expert technical knowledge with intuitive layouts reduces friction for both novices and long-term enthusiasts. In a larger sense, each new web tool is not just about code—it’s about creating an environment where adopting Dash is as seamless as any mainstream financial activity.

### 35:00 – 40:00: Addressing Zero SSL and Protocol Barriers

Here, the topic shifts to frustrations with certain architectural decisions made in the Dash ecosystem, specifically around certificate authorities and secure connections. AJ raises concerns about depending on a single provider for SSL certificates, viewing it as a structural weakness that could hamper Dash’s long-term goals. They propose adopting recognized standards like Let’s Encrypt, which are more universally supported and reduce single points of failure.

The conversation reaffirms that web compatibility is vital for Dash to function as a modern payment method. They argue that if web developers can’t connect to Dash nodes using widely accepted protocols, they’ll avoid building serious applications. By shedding light on these technical challenges, the hosts illustrate why certain behind-the-scenes improvements—although less flashy—are critical for sustained growth. The discussion is passionate, driven by the belief that better standards will lead to a stronger, more resilient network.

### 40:00 – 45:00: Friction with Existing Structures

During these minutes, the speakers address broader disagreements with Dash Core Group’s design decisions, particularly around making Dash accessible through typical web tools. They suggest that while the official approach may prioritize certain performance or backward-compatibility concerns, it could overlook ease of adoption. This tension reflects a long-standing debate in the Dash community: whether to push for mainstream compatibility at the risk of rewriting segments of the code, or to maintain legacy structures that hamper rapid innovation.

Despite the apparent friction, they remain optimistic about forging solutions that work within the protocol’s constraints. The conversation highlights specific technical avenues for bridging the gap—such as new layers of code that can safely interface with standard web infrastructure. By focusing on small, incremental improvements, they believe Dash can eventually meet the demands of modern internet applications, even if it requires rethinking certain entrenched practices.

### 45:00 – 50:00: Proposed Solutions and Future Directions

In this section, AJ outlines a potential path forward to resolve the pressing issues around certificate management and domain naming for Dash nodes. Their strategy involves implementing widely supported TLS and domain protocols that can be deployed on masternodes and Evo nodes, enabling a friendlier environment for web traffic. This approach aims to make it simpler for any website or service to integrate Dash without battling obscure certificate requirements.

They also acknowledge that organizational inertia might slow some of these initiatives. However, they stress that success will come by demonstrating practical, incremental changes that solve real developer pain points. By providing alternate solutions that are well documented, easy to install, and align with industry standards, they hope to reduce the friction that has historically accompanied attempts at large-scale upgrades. This set of ideas reflects a broader push to ensure Dash remains relevant in a competitive crypto landscape.

### 50:00 – 55:00: Balancing Proposals and Community Trust

During these minutes, the speakers tackle the difficulty of pitching highly technical proposals to masternode owners who may not share the same depth of technical knowledge. They note that broad, vague requests often pass because they allow room for optimism, whereas narrowly focused proposals can get mired in details that prove challenging for non-developers to evaluate. Both participants realize the need to communicate complex topics in ways that resonate with varied backgrounds.

They explore different avenues for bridging the communication gap, from detailed demonstrations to smaller, more incremental proposals that showcase tangible progress. The struggle is to maintain transparency about the exact tasks while avoiding information overload. Despite occasional setbacks, the energy remains focused on forging a stronger Dash ecosystem where proposals not only pass but also deliver meaningful results that satisfy both the technical ambitions and the expectations of the community at large.

### 55:00 – 59:07: Final Thoughts and Next Steps

In the closing chapter, the speakers summarize their hope for a Dash economy that thrives within conventional online environments. They argue that a wave of new web-based tools is essential, as it lowers the barrier for developers who want to experiment with cryptocurrency payments but lack the specialized knowledge to build from scratch. By providing straightforward resources, they believe Dash can capture the imagination of countless digital entrepreneurs seeking efficient payment methods.

They end on an optimistic note, recognizing the continued need for discussion, negotiation, and consensus-building. While the path toward broad adoption is anything but smooth, each incremental improvement—from coin mixing tools to domain certificates—brings Dash closer to genuine economic utility. As they wrap up, they reaffirm their dedication to driving adoption through practical innovation, inviting viewers to stay informed and participate in shaping the next wave of proposals and development.

## Transcript

[00:00] Welcome everybody to a late showing of Incubator Weekly today. I had to reschedule for
[00:00] a variety
[00:10] of reasons. We're doing it in the afternoon this time. Welcome, AJ. Got you on
[00:10] for the second time
[00:16] in a row now. Yeah. All right. So the last time that we had you
[00:16] on, we had you talking about
[00:23] the application that you wrote for creating proposals in a web browser. And we're going
[00:23] to
[00:32] review that in a minute. But today we have you on talking about how are
[00:32] we going to create a real
[00:39] dash economy? And that's kind of something that I titled it that we came together,
[00:39] talked about what
[00:46] we wanted to talk about. We have some ideas about what is it? Well, I'll
[00:46] just ask you the question.
[00:55] Like, what do you think that the dash needs in order to create a real
[00:55] dash economy? I'll just
[01:01] leave it open ended for now. I've said this before. It needs an export. It
[01:01] needs something that people
[01:08] want more than they want U S dollars and that they're willing to trade for
[01:08] dash in order to get.
[01:16] So just, just like any economy exists because there is some export. No, no, no
[01:16] economy in the world today
[01:25] exists in isolation. All of them, you know, the, the, the oil is priced in
[01:25] U S dollars.
[01:33] They're essentially our computer chips are priced in, you know, Chinese. So what they're different
[01:44] economies have a primary export and it's something that people are willing to give up
[01:44] some typically
[01:51] fiat currency in order to trade to the other currency to buy that thing. Yeah.
[01:51] And the only thing
[01:59] that I would add to that so far is that, um, I would like, uh,
[01:59] we need exports plural. Yeah. And, and the
[02:08] economy obviously has it. You're just saying primary, uh, primarily economies have like countries will
[02:08] have
[02:15] a primary export, but, um, what, what makes them actual running real economies is that
[02:15] people do perform labor
[02:28] and they create actual products and services. And then they sell those products and services
[02:28] for the money of that
[02:36] economy. And that's, that's actually what creates the economy in a sustainable way. And what
[02:36] we don't
[02:44] have in dash, what we don't have in crypto, uh, widely, I would say is
[02:44] those, those export economies where people are
[02:52] actually making, uh, producing things and then requiring, uh, payment in that currency, whatever economy
[02:52] or crypto
[03:00] crypto, uh, we're talking about. And it's something that we have the inverse we have
[03:00] where people are
[03:09] trading out of cryptocurrency. So for example, you were talking about an AI tool earlier.
[03:09] Uh, we've seen
[03:15] this with some of the hosting services, uh, the, the digital ocean wrapper, you know,
[03:15] people are just
[03:23] basically abusing cryptocurrencies and devaluing them by providing something that the, neither the, like the
[03:31] merchant doesn't ever have a cryptocurrency. So we're in the cryptocurrency space. The trend is
[03:31] to do the
[03:38] opposite to raise the price, provide no value, and then immediately put it back into
[03:38] Fiat.
[03:46] Yeah. And, and that is something that we all have experience with. Um, you know,
[03:46] I, for, for example,
[03:53] I, I earn dash, uh, for what I do, I, I try to create as
[03:53] much value as I can for that. Uh, I'm just one
[04:01] person, but I'm forced to, for the most part, um, sell into us dollars, uh,
[04:01] because the things that I
[04:11] need are denominated in us dollars. And so we need more people requiring and, and
[04:11] at least accepting,
[04:19] uh, cryptocurrencies or dash specifically for those goods and services. Then I would not have
[04:19] to do that.
[04:27] But in order for people to do that, they need to be able to use
[04:27] this cryptocurrency in a way that's
[04:35] as easy or, um, ideally way easier than transacting and using dollars. And so that's
[04:35] where we're going
[04:44] to get into, uh, I'm going to share my screen here. Um, you are, you
[04:44] and me both, um, we
[04:53] are big believers in the, the web, the internet. Um, and there are a ton
[04:53] of products and services that
[05:00] are native to the web. Um, and so in theory, it should be super easy
[05:00] to kind of get people to use
[05:08] a digital currency like dash, at least for web products. Um, but what's the problem
[05:08] with that?
[05:17] Uh, initially, uh, while I get my screen share going, what, what could, if the
[05:17] number,
[05:23] could you do number one? No. And I think that the number one, there's two
[05:23] problems. One,
[05:29] you have to not try to target every merchant. You need to be targeting either
[05:29] new burn merchants that
[05:35] are developing new products, which would be good. Cause again, we need an export. So
[05:35] if somebody else can
[05:40] provide the export, great. Uh, but we also need things to be
[05:46] web enabled, right? And, and a lot of the, the investment funded companies, if you
[05:46] can call them
[05:59] that, that are doing cryptocurrency stuff, they're, they're just, they're just collecting a premium in
[06:07] the middle as, as middlemen, right? W the, the crypto, the cryptocurrencies are not web
[06:07] native.
[06:15] They're only available on the internet via TCP. They're not available on the web and
[06:15] dash falls into
[06:24] that. Yeah. We'll talk more about that distinction because it's something that we talked about,
[06:24] uh,
[06:31] before the show started. Um, but in order to set this up, I, I wanted
[06:31] to go through,
[06:38] so that is the overall theme is that you and I, um, and specifically you
[06:38] with, with the digital cash,
[06:44] uh, developer brand here, you're trying to create tools that make it easier for people
[06:44] to do,
[06:53] uh, use dash on the web. And again, we'll talk about the difference between internet
[06:53] ready
[07:02] and web ready. Um, but before that, I just wanted to briefly go over, uh,
[07:02] some, some overview of what
[07:13] proposals you're suggesting right now. Um, what you have live right now and what you
[07:13] plan to do. So
[07:20] originally I was thinking about calling this, uh, your roadmap, but because it's not completely
[07:20] fleshed
[07:28] out, I didn't want to call it a roadmap, uh, like the digital cash dev
[07:28] roadmap, but it is, we are going
[07:34] to talk about the proposals that you have out right now and which ones you
[07:34] want to propose to the network.
[07:39] So if we go over to our trustee, uh, MNO watch leaderboard, we see that,
[07:39] uh, do a quick find on
[07:50] the page here so people can see the highlighted proposals here. Uh, digital cash dev
[07:50] is, is your
[07:58] name. You have, uh, three proposals, but one of those is kind of defunct. It
[07:58] was a mistake. So you fixed it.
[08:05] Yeah. This one, uh, that's down on the bottom, uh, netting minus 28 votes. That's
[08:05] just ignore that down,
[08:15] vote that this is the fixed version. This is for, uh, your RPC web proxy
[08:15] service that you're just basically
[08:23] maintaining, continuing to maintain for four dash per month. And then this is, this is
[08:23] a proposal that I think
[08:30] people are either not happy with or not understanding. So one of the things that
[08:30] we're going to go through
[08:35] is, um, I want you to explain what this proposal is all about so that
[08:35] people who maybe, maybe have
[08:43] misunderstood it, um, can better understand it. And then we'll also talk about, uh, we'll
[08:43] review some of
[08:52] the previous proposals that you've done like dash join, which is a coin join, uh,
[08:52] implementation that's
[09:00] browser web ready, uh, as well as this, uh, dash proposal project, uh, where you
[09:00] are more, you have an
[09:10] application that allows people to submit dash proposals from a web browser as well. Um,
[09:10] but let's go back
[09:19] now to, uh, the, uh, the project that you already have proposed, uh, and that
[09:19] you're asking for funding
[09:26] for that's this, uh, web wallet QR code explorer. Uh, this link by the way,
[09:26] is this same link that's that
[09:34] you've given in this, um, in the actual proposal. So that's what we're looking at.
[09:34] If anybody's curious,
[09:43] uh, it's the same link, uh, it's the same link. So what is this and
[09:43] how does this help with this
[09:49] overall vision and purpose of being able to give people the ability to use dash,
[09:49] uh, on the web and
[09:59] create, um, yeah, a, an economy that that's easier to use for, let's say native
[09:59] web entrepreneurs.
[10:11] : All right. Well, uh, I'm, I'm going to highlight what, or however you wanted
[10:11] to tackle that.
[10:19] : Okay. I'm, I'm going to highlight a mistake that happened and, and a big
[10:19] L that we had in dash
[10:26] incubator. : Okay. : We had a proposal for a web wallet and we have
[10:26] not produced a web wallet.
[10:34] : Well, we have, but it's not, it's not widely used and you can go
[10:34] ahead and explain why,
[10:41] but, um, I have some ideas on that as well. : We do, we did
[10:41] not produce a web wallet that is
[10:47] ready for people to use. We did not, we did not produce a web wallet
[10:47] that we can be confident. We,
[10:55] we have pieces of a web wallet. We don't have a web wallet. So. :
[10:55] Right. I'm going to bring that up
[11:01] right now, just so we can see what you're talking about. : Yeah. : I
[11:01] think it's under
[11:08] : I believe that the core problem. : Yeah. I think there was two core
[11:08] problems here with this,
[11:19] with this project. One was we wanted to get designed for it. We knew we
[11:19] wanted to get a design for it,
[11:26] but because the designer was available at the time, we got the designer involved before
[11:26] we had the
[11:32] prototype. : That is true. And that's why it looks good. : Right. And the
[11:32] other, the, another major issue
[11:41] was that Jojo ran into some, some sort of chronic illness that he's still struggling
[11:41] with. And, uh,
[11:52] so that the project lost some momentum that way. If we want to have a
[11:52] great web wallet experience
[12:01] with, with, with any, with any bit of code, we, the, the best way to
[12:01] approach it is to make something
[12:06] that is whole and complete, right? Because then at least if you, if you, if
[12:06] you didn't get a hundred
[12:14] percent of everything that you ever wanted it to do, you've got working code and
[12:14] examples of how to do
[12:22] one of the components of it. So one of the key components of a wallet
[12:22] is the ability to look at
[12:29] addresses, be able to load them, be able to sweep them or spend them and
[12:29] be able to see balances.
[12:35] And, uh, so we, we don't have a web tool for that. The mobile wallet
[12:35] doesn't do that. We need as,
[12:46] as we're developing other applications, the address stuff can be pretty complex in particular. One
[12:46] of the
[12:51] problems that has never been solved in the dash core lib is how to, how
[12:51] to do storage. So there's
[13:00] kind of a demo you can do with dash core lib where it kind of
[13:00] creates a wallet for an instance and then,
[13:07] but you can't effectively use it because there's no, there's no, there's no way to
[13:07] do storage with it.
[13:14] that, um, well, the two, two problems. One, it doesn't have any built in storage
[13:14] mechanisms or
[13:20] storage plugins. So you have to, and there's no documentation for it. So you just
[13:20] kind of have to
[13:24] like, go find some example somewhere, you know, it's not a good experience. And then
[13:24] also when you're
[13:31] actually building out an application, there's different areas where you need to, to kind of
[13:31] get
[13:36] into the information. So in my application, I don't necessarily just want to say, Hey,
[13:36] what's the
[13:40] next wallet that doesn't have a bat or the next address that doesn't have a
[13:40] balance. Cause I might
[13:46] want to be able to do things like mark an address that I'm about to
[13:46] use it. So I've, I've asked Freddie
[13:53] to pay this invoice with this address. So I'm going to mark that address as
[13:53] pending. And there's no way
[13:59] to do that with the, you know, the dash, the dash core lips. Now with
[13:59] the dash SDK that we've built,
[14:05] you can do that because it's completely open to you, but there's not, there's, there's
[14:05] not a
[14:13] predefined structure of how to do it. It's very open. So the, the idea of
[14:13] the, the wallet address QR explorer
[14:23] is a way to have wallet phrases and the accounts, the addresses, like basically be
[14:23] able to walk over
[14:36] a wallet and do everything that you can do with a wallet in terms of
[14:36] addresses and balances. So that
[14:43] I was trying to get to this point earlier, but you know, I ramble the,
[14:43] when someone's developing an
[14:51] application, we want them to including myself, yourself, we want them to be able to
[14:51] focus on the
[14:59] unique value of the application, which the address stuff is very blase. It's not exciting.
[14:59] It's not
[15:06] interesting. Well, it is kind of interesting in that the only wallet that I've ever
[15:06] seen do wallets
[15:12] remotely, according to the spec is edge wallet. You know, the dash mobile wallet doesn't
[15:12] do it. Dash core
[15:18] doesn't do it. Um, but the, the mobile edge wallet actually does use some of
[15:18] the features of, of the
[15:24] wallet that are spec'd out. The APIs are available for, uh, you know, it, so,
[15:24] but there, there's some
[15:32] minutia there that we'd like to just say, okay, suppose that the wallet, the wallet
[15:32] and the addressing
[15:38] and the balance mechanism works. Let me focus on the unique value and just have
[15:38] a little bit of a plugin.
[15:42] like here's some addresses that I can plug into this to be able to use
[15:42] or, or just be able to go
[15:49] back and forth with a, essentially a test wallet, but a test wallet that gives
[15:49] you really fine grain
[15:55] control without a lot of tedium because you can using the dash console. You can
[15:55] do some of this stuff,
[16:04] but there's no, there's no available web utility for this. You can't use dash core
[16:04] from the web. You
[16:12] can't, and you can't do a lot of stuff with dash RPC because of the
[16:12] way that the dash RPC directly,
[16:19] you can't use a wallet with that because the wallet is tied to the full
[16:19] node. You can't have
[16:24] individual wallets, uh, over, over RPC. Well, there is kind of a way, but then
[16:24] you have the whole issue
[16:32] of there's no authentication, the private key issue, et cetera. So, and so you wouldn't
[16:32] want to expose a
[16:38] full node wallet to the web. That's just a recipe for disaster. Even if you
[16:38] don't, you personally don't
[16:43] put money in it. You know, it would be weird. So point is have a,
[16:43] have a wallet, but it's not
[16:52] all the features of a wallet. It's just focused around the addresses, loading it, swiping
[16:52] it,
[16:58] and being both an example of how to use the dash SDK that we've created.
[16:58] So if I could go in and look,
[17:04] oh, how did they do that? How did they manage the accounts? You know, you
[17:04] go look at the code,
[17:07] you can see, and then a practical way to be able to use it with
[17:07] other applications. And one of the stretch
[17:12] goals that I put in there is that, you know, if it's on the web,
[17:12] what do we like on the web? We
[17:17] like when you can just go click on something and it says, Hey, do you
[17:17] want to give permission for this?
[17:22] Okay. Right. So one of the things that I would want to integrate it with
[17:22] as a, as an example would be
[17:28] the proposal site right now, the proposal generates a whiff. It's a one-off whiff, you
[17:28] know, that has its
[17:34] dangers. It is saved in local storage, but just in general, anytime you're using a
[17:34] lossy wallet rather
[17:39] than an HD wallet, there's inherent risk there that's much greater than using an HD
[17:39] wallet.
[17:44] So the idea that you could have this HD wallet system in a web app
[17:44] and be able to click over to
[17:50] it and have it have the capabilities that allow you to manage funding and stuff
[17:50] like that via the URL,
[17:56] get passing parameters via URL, like any web application does. I think that that certainly,
[18:03] I mean, it certainly opens up opportunities and I, I, I, I'd like to experiment
[18:03] that and see where it leads.
[18:12] And I, you know, the way that I develop is I don't develop with, okay,
[18:12] here's the bullet point list of
[18:19] things that are going to be done. I approach with, here's a bullet point list
[18:19] of tasks that need to be
[18:25] accomplished, but not how they're going to be accomplished. And as I develop, it's an
[18:25] iterative
[18:31] process. And I realized, oh, and I, and I don't go, I'm an out of
[18:31] the box thinker. I'm not going in with
[18:36] preconceived notions. Well, because this other app does it this way, that's the way that
[18:36] it has to be
[18:40] done. I look at it more from a constraints perspective. Like what does the protocol
[18:40] dictate?
[18:44] And anything that works in the protocol is allowed. So for example, with the proposal
[18:44] app,
[18:51] if you want to bring that back up, the, the, uh, the, the protocol is
[18:51] way, way, way too loose. Cause
[19:01] there was the problems with the, the, the epochs and the, the trouble that you
[19:01] could get into there
[19:08] where you could lose money. There was the, the, the problem with the transaction being
[19:08] sent before
[19:14] all the necessary, uh, verifications would have taken place. Cause the transaction was actually
[19:20] sent to get the ID to be able to test the G object rather than
[19:20] doing the other way around. So when I
[19:26] look at how does the protocol actually work, I come up with a very different
[19:26] product than, you know,
[19:33] there's two other proposal systems. One that is, I guess the command line and dash
[19:33] core. And another
[19:42] one is, is, uh, a web system that then builds up the command line for
[19:42] dash core. Whereas this has no
[19:49] dash core. This is, this is just direct via RPC. And because of that, you
[19:49] know, I'm looking at it, not in
[19:57] terms of date because it's not done by date, it's done by block. And so
[19:57] as I'm, as I'm going through
[20:03] it, it's like, okay, this is the natural way to do this. If you want
[20:03] to build some other abstraction
[20:07] on top of it, uh, if you want to, you know, fiddle with things, the,
[20:07] the library is very open in terms
[20:13] of how you can construct this, but this is kind of the natural result of,
[20:13] okay, I have to work with
[20:19] pay periods. It's not about dates. It's about pay periods. Pay periods are not about
[20:19] dates either.
[20:24] They're about blocks, but we need dates for users. So it was, it was very,
[20:24] um, uh, I forget the word
[20:31] right now, emergent design. Right. And I'm not saying that the design, the colors, the
[20:31] whatever
[20:35] is good, but I believe that the flow is generally good. You want to be
[20:35] able to view what are the pay
[20:40] periods. You want to be able to select number of payments, what pay period you're
[20:40] in, what amount,
[20:45] there's some things that have to be done here. Like the structure of this, I
[20:45] believe is very,
[20:48] very good. And so with the wallet, it, it's not something where like, again, I
[20:48] don't believe
[20:55] in doing design first. I think it's a waste of resources because you design is
[20:55] so expensive.
[21:00] I think that design in many ways is more expensive than development is. So you
[21:00] really want to have a
[21:05] really strong prototype before you go into design. So I can't show you like, okay,
[21:05] this is what the
[21:09] thing's going to look like, but what I can tell you is the thing, meaning
[21:09] the QR code, uh, application,
[21:15] so address, the address wallet, yeah. Address wallet explorer. So the proposal that you have
[21:15] up for 75
[21:20] dash. So, but, but basically what people would see is they'd see an application that
[21:20] looks similar to this,
[21:26] but instead of it being focused around creating proposals, it's focused around, uh, you know,
[21:32] you might have some input boxes that let you select which part of the path
[21:32] you want to look at, which
[21:39] address you want to get for a specific path in the HD path, for example,
[21:39] is that what you're saying?
[21:45] Or can you, can you share my screen? Uh, yes. All right. Go ahead and
[21:45] share my screen. All right. So
[21:55] this is what I, what I'm still working on with the coin join stuff. And
[21:55] so like, you know, the, the cash
[22:04] drawer, uh, there's some other stuff we talked about before, but here's how I'm representing
[22:04] the, the
[22:10] addresses right now. Right. So I need to be able to see these because I
[22:10] need to be able to debug them and
[22:15] stuff. And this is not the optimal way to do it, but this kind of
[22:15] gives me a sense of,
[22:20] okay, let me check which, you know, this one was probably the one that had
[22:20] a transaction most
[22:25] recently. Let me go check that and see, did that match up what I was
[22:25] expecting? It allows me to
[22:29] debug a little bit. I've got this table that shows some balances and stuff. Uh,
[22:29] and this is really,
[22:36] it's built around the idea of how do I test the coin join process. And
[22:36] as you know, over the next week,
[22:43] this will get cleaned up and, and this will be released as a, as a
[22:43] product, but it's not going
[22:48] to be everything I want in an address inspection tool. It's going to be the
[22:48] pieces that I need for
[22:53] coin join, but you can see here, I have a wallet. Here's where the 12
[22:53] word phrases are. I can click
[23:01] reveal to reveal those. I can adjust the accounts. So I could say, let's actually
[23:01] work on account five.
[23:07] You can see it updated there. It actually went and fetched the balances of the
[23:07] first several
[23:12] addresses of that. If I go into pools here. Oh, interesting. Hmm. I have to
[23:12] not do that.
[23:21] That's a, that's just a bug with the browser password manager that I'll have to
[23:21] find a way
[23:28] to work around in the future. Um, it's the password managers are getting quite aggressive
[23:28] and I've tried
[23:33] to label things as not a password and it isn't respecting it anyway. Um, and
[23:33] then here, this is
[23:39] showing how the, the coin join nodes, what they're connected to, and they'll actually show
[23:39] multiple
[23:44] nodes and it's going to show the pool denominations. But yeah. So I think that
[23:44] the wallet explorer is going
[23:49] to not be just one single page. It's probably going to be multiple pages, one
[23:49] where there's wallets and
[23:55] you can select a wallet or I don't exactly know what it's going to look
[23:55] like, but it's going to have
[24:00] the ability to go through and change things like, you know, the phrase, the salt,
[24:00] which account you're on.
[24:08] And if we do the Evo wallets as well, then we'll also support the Evo
[24:08] path rather than the standard
[24:17] path. So this is the standard path. Evo has its own bespoke protocol. Yeah. I
[24:17] mean, there's still,
[24:25] it's still, it's still following the spec, just not the bit 44 step spec. It's
[24:25] following the more
[24:30] generalized spec of having a, a, a path that has different sections of the path
[24:30] that each one,
[24:37] each section of the path has, uh, different, uh, creates different addresses. So yeah, I
[24:37] believe
[24:45] it's 43 versus 44 or something like that. 39. Yeah. It's based on BIP 39,
[24:45] but it doesn't follow any of
[24:54] the existing standards, uh, that have been implemented. So I think the BIP 39 is,
[24:54] is, is something different,
[25:02] but anyway, it doesn't matter. Uh, I think that was regarding the, the past phrase,
[25:02] the seed phrases and
[25:09] stuff. Oh, maybe it is. But anyway, um, basically what you're saying is there are
[25:09] things that are
[25:17] related to just a wallet specifically and HD paths that you want to create a
[25:17] separate application just
[25:24] for that. So you've, you know, you've basically been, uh, creating this, uh, digital. It's
[25:24] 32.
[25:31] BIP 32. That's right. Yeah, exactly. That's the, that's the generalized, um, specification for
[25:38] hierarchical deterministic paths. Um, so anyway, um, yeah, I want to be able to,
[25:45] I want people to understand that general concept. I know that it's going to be
[25:45] hard for a lot of people
[25:52] to, to see the value proposition, to see exactly what you are about. I would
[25:52] just throw a trust me,
[26:00] bro out there on this one. I mean, I, unfortunately most people have not seen
[26:00] what I've done in the past
[26:05] because most of what I've done in the past was with anticipation that we were
[26:05] going to have these
[26:11] front end developers join dash incubator. And then they were going to be building these
[26:11] front ends
[26:16] on top of the tools. And now I'm doing the front ends myself, but I
[26:16] just throw out a trust me, bro.
[26:21] I mean, I don't know. It's, it's hard for me because I don't know, you
[26:21] know, people that vote,
[26:26] I don't know if they follow dash incubator and the, you know, I don't know.
[26:26] I don't know anything
[26:29] about the people that vote, but this is, this, this is a tool that we
[26:29] need. We need to be every,
[26:37] every part of the SDK needs to be independently demoable and testable. And that the
[26:37] address part
[26:44] is, is kind of big. Cause you've got the, the, the key generation, you've got
[26:44] the hierarchical paths,
[26:50] you've got the QR codes, each one of those. Well, the HD pads are not
[26:50] simple or at least the, the,
[26:56] the algorithm, the algorithm is not super simple. The keys are pretty simple, but, but
[26:56] you know,
[27:01] each one of those have some components to them, but kind of put them together.
[27:01] And this is what the
[27:05] addressing scheme of the wallet is. We need that. We need, we need to, it
[27:05] is surprising to me how many
[27:11] people that have worked in dash for years do not understand primitives about dash. And
[27:11] I think that
[27:17] as people understand the primitives better, it enables them, empowers them to better understand
[27:23] what they're building and what, what the wiggle room they have is. So they don't
[27:23] feel pigeonholed.
[27:28] Uh, because if you just go off of what has been, you're going to create
[27:28] poor user experiences because
[27:34] you, you're going to, when, when you open it up so that you can see
[27:34] what the possibilities are and have
[27:40] a mental model of this is how a connects to B and how B connects
[27:40] to C, then that, that frees you up to
[27:46] be able to create better user experiences in general. Okay. So in some ways, in
[27:46] some ways, what I'm hearing
[27:52] and what I'm seeing, um, from the applications that you have built and the applications
[27:52] that you want to
[28:00] build and the tools, the applications and tools that you want to build in some
[28:00] ways, it's moving more in the
[28:07] direction of let's give developers the ability to see more under the hood. Whereas something
[28:07] like, um,
[28:15] dash evolution and the, the mobile wallets that the DCG is building is actually trying
[28:15] to go in a little
[28:23] bit of the opposite direction of saying, let's hide all that under the hood and
[28:23] let's give people a
[28:28] username. And they don't have to know anything about what's going on underneath the hood.
[28:32] I think that the compliment between these two is, is, is good. Like you want
[28:32] developers to have low
[28:38] level tools that they can know and know what's going on under the hood. Uh,
[28:38] but then allow then
[28:46] designers to create different user experiences on top of that. But without being able to
[28:46] have the debugging
[28:52] tools in the web browser, um, that makes it difficult, I think so. Yeah. And
[28:52] this is,
[29:01] this is something where I don't know. It seems like historically when like people do
[29:01] stuff for free
[29:10] and they ask for money, they ask for pennies on the dollar. And so this
[29:10] is one of those weird situations
[29:16] where I could just build it and then hope to get reimbursed. But I'm very
[29:16] fearful of that because
[29:23] what I see from the proposal history, what I see, and I could, you know,
[29:23] correct me, but what I see is
[29:29] the more vague with fewer details about what's being built and when it will be
[29:29] delivered,
[29:34] the higher likelihood something will pass. And the more concrete, the less likely something will
[29:34] be to
[29:41] pass. And I think that's just human nature. When we can hope for something, we
[29:41] can aspire towards
[29:45] something. We can't give a tangible value to it, but when we know exactly what
[29:45] something is,
[29:51] it's really, really hard for us to swallow that pill. And so I don't know
[29:51] if this is actually
[29:55] a good approach. I think logically everybody will agree. Yeah. We wish that we could
[29:55] vote on things
[30:00] that are smaller, but I think that the reality of it may be that, that
[30:00] that's not, you know, it's the
[30:06] sip test type of thing, or, you know, you know, this, this has been studied
[30:06] psychologically a lot of
[30:11] times. So I don't know if this is actually going to work out, but you
[30:11] know, I need to be
[30:15] able to get funded in order to do stuff. I would love to be able
[30:15] to say, Hey, here are the things
[30:19] I'm working on and this, you know, let me deliver this at this price. This
[30:19] is the thing I'm going to
[30:26] deliver. Um, but I don't know what the, I don't know what the future holds,
[30:26] but there's, there's a
[30:31] lot of stuff. I, I know, I know everybody knows this. You, you, why did
[30:31] Stripe become popular?
[30:37] Why did Stripe become popular when it's the same thing as the other 12 payment
[30:37] processing APIs?
[30:43] Because they gave developers better tools to debug with and better documentation.
[30:49] Mm-hmm . Yeah, that's definitely true. I, I hear that a lot, um, from just
[30:49] my, my research and, and, and
[30:56] going, watching videos about traditional web to development. And I do hear that a lot,
[30:56] that that's
[31:04] why people choose Stripe is because the API documentation is, is the best. And so
[31:04] that is.
[31:11] But it's, but it's the same API. Like, to be clear, you go look at
[31:11] fluid pay or bank quest or NMI.
[31:17] It's all exactly the same thing. They don't have any unique advantage other than that.
[31:17] They just have
[31:24] better. They, they just, they put a little, they were the first ones to put
[31:24] a style sheet on the
[31:32] documentation page. Hmm. Yeah. And I, I don't know. There, there could be lots of
[31:32] different reasons,
[31:37] but one, one reason is that they, they probably paid a bunch of develop, like
[31:37] had a bunch of VC funding
[31:42] that, that paid a bunch. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's definitely, there's
[31:42] definitely
[31:47] that, but, but you know, NMI only just like this year or maybe last year,
[31:47] very recently within the last
[31:53] year or two NMI finally added a style sheet to their documentation and it's a
[31:53] night and day difference.
[31:59] Now they look just like Stripe. All right. Well, you know, one thing that I,
[31:59] that I didn't mention,
[32:05] but I wanted to circle back to that you were talking about with the, the
[32:05] tool that you want to build
[32:11] with this proposal, the, the, the wallet QR Explorer is the being able to, to
[32:11] see and derive evolution
[32:23] wallet paths. I think that that I have heard in the community, several people wondering
[32:23] like how they
[32:31] can get that information. So definitely could help people at least understand the difference between
[32:41] a traditional, uh, uh, or yeah, 32, 44, 44, uh, path versus the new path
[32:41] that evolution uses. So, uh, being able
[32:55] to kind of understand that difference would be helpful. Uh, yeah. And we've done some
[32:55] work
[33:04] on the, uh, a web SDK for Evo and that part has been accomplished. You
[33:04] know, so, so that this would be
[33:14] taking, you know, we'd be taking some of that work and then bringing it to
[33:14] the web so that it's more
[33:21] direct. I think the smaller we can get, the more focused we can get on
[33:21] smaller tools because we need
[33:26] to build products, but we also need to build tools and tools help us build
[33:26] products. We can build
[33:34] products much faster when we have, you know, when we're not bogged down in, um,
[33:40] you know, some ginormous set of dozens or hundreds of things that need to get
[33:40] done. We could just focus
[33:48] on, okay, here's, you know, two to five things that need to get done in
[33:48] that realm and be able to see,
[33:53] okay, this is what it looks like. This is how, this is how you explore
[33:53] that part. It helps you,
[34:00] it helps you to be able to put together. And then when you reskin it,
[34:00] yeah. I mean, for end users,
[34:04] uh, now me as an end user, yes, I, I actually want to be able
[34:04] to get in the nitty gritty. I'd still like
[34:10] to be able to, to, um, to be able to view my addresses and stuff
[34:10] like that. That's really frustrating
[34:15] on the mobile wallet that I don't have the ability to market addresses pending, but,
[34:15] but that's not,
[34:21] that's not like we don't need to have all the options and shouldn't have all
[34:21] the options
[34:25] up front and center for the user. I think that for users, we should still
[34:25] have an advanced setting,
[34:29] you know, advanced tab. I don't think that we should say, well, users are so
[34:29] dumb that we should
[34:33] never give them the ability to interact to their wallet in any way other than
[34:33] clicking this button
[34:39] or that button. But I do think that that is like, okay, what's the primary
[34:39] way I'm going to use the
[34:43] wallet? It should just open up straight to the scan. You know, the primary way
[34:43] that I'm going to use it
[34:48] is I'm going to be scanning something or I'm going to be sending a message
[34:48] to someone for, for a request,
[34:55] you know? So yeah, focus on the happy path for sure. But as developers, we
[34:55] need to be able to get
[35:03] in the nitty gritty so that we can develop the best happy paths, right? Because
[35:03] you cannot have a genetic
[35:08] evolution of user experience if nobody can figure out how to do anything except for
[35:08] one narrow way.
[35:18] Yeah. If nobody knows the fundamentals, the, the primitives of how you're actually,
[35:26] how you actually do this stuff, that is something that you're trying to expose to
[35:26] a general web developer
[35:31] audience where, you know, maybe, yeah, sure. Maybe DCG has very, uh, detailed inner, uh,
[35:31] knowledge of how
[35:39] evolution works and everything, but we want to be able to give that kind of,
[35:39] uh, that knowledge and
[35:46] that understanding through these tools to all sorts of, uh, web developers so that they
[35:46] can feel
[35:52] well, and, and even they've pigeonholed themselves, even they've pigeonholed themselves. Like they,
[36:00] they, they, they are not capable without significant rewriting of creating a better
[36:05] UX experience on the mobile wallet or dash core with dash core, particularly because they
[36:05] will not
[36:09] cut ties with Bitcoin. They will not do something that, that, you know, impacts their
[36:09] ability to do
[36:15] merges back and forth. I think that's sad because we could have such a better
[36:15] experience. Um, but you
[36:20] know, they're, they have designed their code, not as building blocks, but as like a
[36:20] house where there's a door
[36:28] here and there's a door there and everything that goes on inside is just a
[36:28] black box.
[36:31] And so even they, if they wanted to build a better user experience, they would
[36:31] struggle to do it
[36:38] because they, they, they did not, they themselves have not designed with that in mind.
[36:38] And, and we've
[36:46] seen that over the years, like, you know, why does the mobile wallet not, you
[36:46] know, there's things that
[36:52] come up over and over and over again, why aren't they being solved? Well, because
[36:52] it kind of would
[36:56] require fundamental rewrite. And that's, and that's essentially what we've done is we've rewritten,
[37:01] you know, with the dash SDK, we've rewritten the majority of everything that you can
[37:01] do with a wallet,
[37:06] but now we got to get that into UIs and stuff so that people can
[37:06] see it, not just as code.
[37:12] Okay. So we've talked to, we've talked quite a bit about the existing, the existing
[37:12] proposal that
[37:17] you have up for this wallet explorer QR thing. Let's, let's talk a little bit
[37:17] about other options
[37:28] or just your general, your general strategy going forward with, you know, I know you
[37:28] have worked a lot
[37:36] with dash in the past and I personally see the value in your work. Um,
[37:36] I want you to continue
[37:43] working for dash maybe this, uh, QR wallet explorer thing, isn't something that people want
[37:43] to fund
[37:50] necessarily. So it certainly looks like that so far, but what other ideas, it's, it's
[37:50] bifurcating,
[37:58] right? Because it seems to be reactionary because it seems like it goes positive for
[37:58] a couple of hours.
[38:05] It's a very small amount of the votes so far. So let's not read too
[38:05] much.
[38:08] Okay. Sure.
[38:09] But, uh, cause we still got, you know, the majority of the voting period left
[38:09] and the majority of the
[38:15] votes left. So I don't want to get too high on that, but I do
[38:15] want to highlight that, that your overall
[38:22] strategy is to give people what I think people have been asking for, for a
[38:22] long time, which is we want more
[38:28] granular decision-making ability and, you know, having a proposal that's specifically for this
[38:37] thing or this thing or that thing that's should be ideally exactly what people want.
[38:37] So what other
[38:43] proposals do you have in mind? Um, or just more generally, what process do you
[38:43] want to follow as you,
[38:51] as a digital cash dev are continuing to, to develop for dash?
[38:57] The truth is I don't know, right? Like the, the ideal would be
[39:01] some sort of way to communicate, to get feedback, right? Because what I, what I'd
[39:01] like to do is put
[39:08] up 10 proposals and say, okay, here's all the things I have on the docket.
[39:08] Y'all decide the priority
[39:13] because at like there, this is where the, the organization funding wins out over individual
[39:21] item funding. I will not be able to work for dash unless I get funding,
[39:21] right? And like, I got to
[39:30] leave dash entirely, right? Like I don't think that you care necessarily what you're doing.
[39:30] You want,
[39:36] you genuinely want to develop the things that the community wants. Um, but you don't
[39:36] know what that,
[39:41] that is. And so maybe the, the strategy of putting five proposals up and saying,
[39:45] which one do you like best? Um, maybe that's what you should do. I don't
[39:45] know.
[39:51] Well, there's a paradox of choice too, right? So I can't, I can't put up
[39:51] too many proposals
[39:57] because people aren't going to take the time to read them or understand them. And
[39:57] I can't expect that
[40:01] of people. So I need to, you know, there's, there's gotta be a bridge, obviously
[40:01] the something
[40:07] about the, the, you know, the proposal I had up, which I thought it would
[40:07] be an easier one
[40:11] because it's such a small amount. And, you know, even though I can't articulate super
[40:16] clearly what it, what it's going like, I can't, I can't give you a vision
[40:16] of what it's going to look
[40:22] like. Cause I don't know yet. I know that it's going to be a tool
[40:22] that's going to help anybody
[40:25] be able to understand addresses and work with them and have code snippets that they
[40:25] can translate into
[40:31] any application that they're building. I know that that will be the result, but what
[40:31] exactly
[40:37] the bullet points of that are, I'm not quite sure yet. I know what some
[40:37] of them are because of the
[40:41] work that I've been doing with dash proposal and coin join and my CLI wallet
[40:41] and stuff like that. But
[40:47] anyway, um, but I, I don't know. So I might try a few more of
[40:47] these specific proposals and see if
[40:55] we can get some things to go through. Cause I need, I need something to,
[40:55] you know, to go through
[41:01] basically, you know, yeah, I've got, I've got some minimums that if I don't meet,
[41:01] then I just,
[41:06] I just won't be able to work for dash and you know, that's, that's just
[41:06] that whatever, but I'd like to.
[41:12] And there, yeah. So there, one of the things that it seems timely that I'm
[41:12] going to submit a proposal
[41:21] on and people might understand it might get downvoted, whatever. I don't know, but you
[41:21] know,
[41:24] the zero SSL thing has come up again and we know what the solution for
[41:24] that is. That's perfectly
[41:30] clear. Uh, I think the big issue with fixing it is that I don't think
[41:30] that the DCG people want it fixed
[41:38] because, well, I mean, we know that they don't because we've had these conversations in
[41:38] the past
[41:43] and they have, you know, kind of done this, you know, wiggle, woggle thing with,
[41:43] oh, we want your
[41:49] help with this. Oh, well, you know, like, this is going to break. We need
[41:49] to do this. No, no,
[41:53] no, no, no, we're not going to fix it. As you just do that. Like,
[41:53] I like, I, I can't help you there.
[42:00] You know, like you're, you're going down anyway. And now it's, and now it's come
[42:00] up several times.
[42:04] People are seeing, okay, this zero SSL thing, like relying on a single authority for
[42:04] a bespoke
[42:09] protocol. That is not an industry standard is not a viable solution, right? We need
[42:09] something that works
[42:17] on the web zero, the zero cell can work on the web, but the way
[42:17] that they've implemented is not,
[42:22] doesn't work on the web. So we need something that works on the web and
[42:22] we need, we need to enable
[42:28] people to use both dashes. We have now as RPC and P2P, as well as
[42:28] Evo, they need to be able to use it on
[42:36] the web, right? If they can't use it on the web, what is the purpose
[42:36] of all this?
[42:41] We did talk about that a little bit in the beginning. We said we'd go
[42:41] into more details. So
[42:44] I think some people that are viewing might not know the difference in the distinction
[42:44] that you're
[42:50] making between the web and the internet. So like something might be available on the
[42:50] internet, but
[42:55] you're not saying that it's available on the web. So what do you mean?
[42:58] Okay. Internet is TCP, IP and UDP. Those are the protocols of the internet. So
[42:58] internet is just
[43:04] a super, super broad term. Like, you know, flour is an ingredient and you can
[43:04] make a lot of stuff
[43:10] with it. You can make pizza with it. And there's a lot of different types
[43:10] of pizza, right? So the web
[43:14] is built on TCP, IP. That is, that is the foundational protocol of the, of
[43:14] the web is one of the protocols of
[43:22] the internet. Well, and DNS. So the web dictates DNS, meaning names that you can
[43:22] type in a web browser
[43:31] and that those names resolve the TCP, IP. That is the web. And in modern
[43:31] days, you can kind of throw
[43:38] TLS in there as well. I think that it's kind of fair to say that
[43:38] the web has evolved to, it's not that
[43:45] you would say that something isn't the web, if it doesn't have TLS, but rather
[43:45] that TLS is a fundamental
[43:50] part of the web, that security layer. So that, that is the web. So if
[43:50] you're, if you're requiring people
[43:56] to deal with IP addresses, if you need to use, you know, types of specialized
[43:56] certificates that aren't
[44:03] going to work in a web browser, like basically if it doesn't work in a
[44:03] web browser or people have to type
[44:07] in numbers, that's not the web. So something now that you've said that generally, what
[44:07] specifically,
[44:16] and I, I don't want to go down this rabbit hole too, too much because
[44:16] it is a side tangent,
[44:21] but what specifically, just to wrap that thought up, would you be suggesting as maybe
[44:21] an example of
[44:28] something that you could propose alternatively? Well, it's not alternatively, it's in addition to,
[44:35] right? Because I'm not going to change DCG's mind. Like they've, they're, they're setting their
[44:35] ways.
[44:39] It's a, it's a matter of the voters. If the voters want it, the voters
[44:39] don't want it.
[44:42] I meant alternatively to the proposal that may not pass that you, you have for
[44:42] the 75 dash for the
[44:49] Explorer. If you wanted to propose something else. Well, it's not an alternative. It's in
[44:49] addition to,
[44:55] it's in addition to, cause I've got, you know, I've got bandwidth to do both,
[44:55] but I, but I won't be able to
[45:01] put the proposal up to get it done in a month simply because the budget's
[45:01] not there because I
[45:05] mean, we have, we have so much dash, but the free dash, you know, what's
[45:05] left over after the, you know,
[45:13] the one, the one giant request and its supplement is like peanuts. Right. But, but,
[45:13] uh, yeah. So what I,
[45:23] the solution is very simple. It's, it's easy to understand. Technically it's well-known there's
[45:28] libraries and standards and everything. We just take, uh, it's called S and I routing.
[45:35] So you, we need to give, we need to give people, and this is something
[45:35] people ask for in discord.
[45:40] I've seen this at least, you know, people want to be able to put it,
[45:40] have a domain
[45:43] for their Evo node or their master nodes. They want to be able to have
[45:43] a domain, either one that they get
[45:47] automatically or one that they choose. They want to be able to get certificates automatically
[45:51] or have the option to choose the certificate. So, you know, we just need some
[45:51] software that they can
[45:57] run that just sets that up for them. And then we'll take incoming web requests
[45:57] and then route it to
[46:04] their, their node. So, I mean, it's just essentially it's adding the names and the
[46:04] TLS is the core thing.
[46:12] Then what I've already done, you know, we need to be able to expose the
[46:12] RPCs on the web.
[46:18] The P2P is an internet protocol. It's a public internet protocol.
[46:22] It's just not compatible with the web. And to get it compatible with the web
[46:22] is a very thin layer.
[46:26] I think I've got like two or 300 lines of code or something that make
[46:26] it compatible with the web.
[46:31] So we can get P2P on the web. And then some of the other protocols
[46:31] like,
[46:34] And by that, you mean that the dash peer, peer protocol, um, people can access
[46:34] that,
[46:41] that messaging protocol through the web, through, uh, the library that you have made.
[46:48] Yeah. Yeah. And then, and then there's the GRPC stuff, you know, we, we want
[46:48] to get that on the web.
[46:55] So that, that's kind of ironic because it's actually, if I remember correctly, it's, it's,
[46:55] you know,
[47:01] it's, it's basically it's Jason under the hood anyway, but then they added a layer
[47:01] on top of it to
[47:06] make it not compatible with the web, which I just, you know, I, I just
[47:06] get really frustrated about this.
[47:12] I mean, if you paid me $10 million to do something I said I was
[47:12] going to do, and then I made sure
[47:17] that I did lots of things, but that I specifically disabled the thing you asked
[47:17] me to do.
[47:22] You know, I, I, again, I, I'm sorry. I can't talk about it unbiased. I'm
[47:22] just pissed about it.
[47:29] But you're just saying, you're just saying GRPC, let's, let's get that protocol so that
[47:29] people can
[47:34] use it on the web instead of just, um, yeah, we, no, I'm, I'm, I'm
[47:34] talking about what they have done.
[47:42] They like that is dishonest. It's who's they what DCG has done with this. I'm,
[47:42] I'm frustrated
[47:51] about it because it's dishonest. It's dishonest to take so like to take all that
[47:51] money and, and to work
[47:56] on some pet project and, and to never actually release what was promised, which is
[47:56] we're going
[48:04] to have usernames for dash on the web. I mean, I could be wrong. I
[48:04] thought that's what was promised.
[48:09] Okay. So there's a lot wrapped up there. I can tell you've got disagreements with
[48:09] DCG. Obviously
[48:16] I have no problem with having disagreements with DCG. I think that's a healthy part
[48:16] of,
[48:21] uh, of, of dash that people have different ideas and they bring those to the
[48:21] table and they see
[48:28] which ideas are better. Um, I would like, uh, I wish I could help people
[48:28] understand what's more,
[48:35] more what's, what's in your mind, because I know that it is a little bit
[48:35] difficult to, uh, express,
[48:42] but it's just, I I've looked at the code. I've dealt with the protocols. I
[48:42] mean, like we've had this back
[48:48] and forth over the last couple of years where, you know, and, and no, I'm,
[48:48] I'm not friendly. I'm not
[48:53] going to say, Hey, you know, kind, sir, you're magnificent. Uh, you, you write such
[48:53] wonderful code,
[48:58] but I noticed this problem though. I'm the kind of guy that's going to come
[48:58] in and say,
[49:01] this sucks. This is irresponsible. Who's in charge of this? Please fix it.
[49:05] Like, yeah, I think we could have, we could have episodes on all these things,
[49:09] but I don't want to, I don't want to do that. The core thing, the
[49:09] core thing I'm saying is
[49:14] there, there's an easy path forward where we can, we can work with what DCG
[49:14] has provided and we can
[49:23] enable it on the web. That's what I'm saying. And so that I'm, I don't
[49:23] know what I should call it so
[49:29] that people can understand it because it's a very technical thing, but essentially it is,
[49:34] it is something that allows them to have domains or they can still have IP
[49:34] addresses to have custom
[49:39] certificates or automated certificates that works with web standards. So zero SSL is its own
[49:39] bespoke
[49:45] protocol. It's only provided by one provider. They are not like, whereas let's encrypt the
[49:45] alternative
[49:52] protocol that most, most people are using is there's several providers that offer it. It's,
[49:57] it's you know, you're, you're not going to have, you're not going to have the
[49:57] problems that,
[50:01] that were predictable with zero SSL, which is because they're the only provider of their
[50:01] protocol.
[50:07] Once they got enough users, they switch it to a paid only protocol like that.
[50:07] That was, you know,
[50:13] that was obviously that's what every company does. Yeah. Yeah. So, but with, with let's
[50:13] encrypt is more
[50:21] like email, right? Like Gmail can't flip a switch and say, okay, you can't use
[50:21] email anymore unless
[50:27] you pay us because you could just switch to somebody else's competition and that's what
[50:27] keeps Gmail free.
[50:31] Right. Um, so let's encrypt is, is an open protocol that I've actually implemented myself
[50:31] for some projects,
[50:39] not the server side, but the client side. And there's, there's libraries in Golang to
[50:39] do this.
[50:45] Uh, and it, and like, we can get around every problem by doing some custom
[50:45] coding.
[50:52] I understand why they, they, I don't understand why they went with Envoy. Cause that
[50:52] one's kind
[50:57] of like a weird one that came, came out of nowhere, but, but I understand
[50:57] in general that the idea of
[51:02] wanting to use off the shelf software, but what we're doing is so highly specific
[51:02] and what our needs
[51:07] are so highly specific. And it's so easy to write the software and go because
[51:07] go has all the primitives,
[51:13] like everything's packages, the library, TLS is a library. Let's encrypt his life. Everything's
[51:17] a library and it's Lego blocks. It's not something that I'm going to put together
[51:17] in a weekend,
[51:21] but it is something that, you know, I'll be able to put together and it,
[51:21] and it's not going to be like,
[51:29] oh, you got to trust AJ's implementation of everything, because what I'm going to be
[51:29] writing
[51:32] is a lot of glue code and business logic. I'm not going to be implementing,
[51:32] or I'm not going to be
[51:37] inventing cryptography algorithms or anything. This is all standard stuff. And so we can take
[51:37] that and we
[51:42] can make it something that can be deployed super easy. That runs on top of
[51:42] the master nodes and the
[51:46] evo nodes that gives, that gives whatever, and you know, have a checkbox interface. It'll
[51:46] be ugly.
[51:51] It'll be like the other interfaces that I've created, but I have a checkbox interface
[51:51] where they can put in
[51:56] like, yes, I want to allow, um, RPC access. I want to allow P2P access.
[51:56] I want to, you know, I, I want to,
[52:05] this is the domain name I want to use, whatever. And then one other component
[52:05] to that is that we do
[52:10] need registry services. And so what I'm imagining that this looks like in the best
[52:10] case is that we
[52:16] piggyback on the registry service we already have. So we have the MN list, uh,
[52:16] RPC. So, uh, let me share
[52:24] my screen and I'll, we'll bring this back over. Uh, let's see. Can I, let's
[52:24] share my screen again.
[52:31] There we go. We'll share my screen. So I'm going to go to RPC explorer
[52:31] real quick and we can go to, what is it?
[52:38] Okay. There it is. Master node list. So I don't think I got to do
[52:38] anything there. So we'll go ahead and fetch this.
[52:46] All right. So this is the registry that we have now. Actually the address there,
[52:50] you should be able to put a domain name in here. There's, there's nothing preventing
[52:50] that other than
[52:54] some arbitrary code that forces it, but it was designed. If you look at the
[52:54] source code, it's
[52:58] actually designed to handle domain names in there. Um, so one day, you know, if
[52:58] there's enough pressure
[53:04] from the voters, DCG will open it up. Cause there's nothing, there's no technical reason
[53:04] that they can't
[53:08] put the domain name in there. Uh, but anyway, so we can have, we could
[53:08] do, we just take from the
[53:13] addresses from the IP addresses from there. We can fetch a list of nodes that
[53:13] are running
[53:22] this other, this other software that operates at the web layer. Cause this is down
[53:22] at the internet
[53:28] layer and we need something like we need some sort of RPC proxy to access
[53:28] it. So it's a little bit of
[53:33] a chicken and egg problem, but I mean, same thing like DCG is already doing
[53:33] where they provide a seed
[53:38] node list. We could also do that as well. We could provide a seed node
[53:38] list and you could just piggyback
[53:42] off of the seed nodes, or we could pick some random out of here and
[53:42] try it, but we can get the list of
[53:46] the web. What, like what master nodes and even nodes support the web and then
[53:46] have them broadcast to each
[53:54] other. You know, just like they do in the P2P network. We just do it
[53:54] at the web layer and we just
[53:58] have them broadcast messages to each other saying, Hey, I'm on the web. And you
[53:58] don't have to worry,
[54:03] you know, I don't have to implement another blockchain or anything. Cause we already got
[54:03] that in
[54:06] here, right? So we, we already have, we can already look up and say, okay,
[54:06] any, any evil node or master
[54:13] node can know whether or not another one is valid at the web layer. Cause
[54:13] they could, they all have this
[54:18] list and they can just validate that the web layer resolves to this correct address
[54:18] here, you know,
[54:25] know the, so it matches. And then you can look at stuff like the public
[54:25] key operator address and the
[54:31] pro TX hash. So there, there, you don't need to do like 10 million layers
[54:31] of validation, but you could,
[54:37] if you wanted to it's at, at the web layer, it's pretty much simple enough
[54:37] to say if the, you know,
[54:42] if the nodes agree on what their names are and what their addresses are and
[54:42] multiple nodes agree,
[54:49] then, you know, you're good. And even if they don't agree, okay, so what's the
[54:49] worst that can
[54:54] happen? You, you end up connecting to a node that can see some traffic.
[54:59] Okay. Well, I think that we're, we're, we're pretty deep into a rabbit hole here
[54:59] with this.
[55:06] Okay. I do want to, I want to bring it back to, I, I know
[55:06] this has been a bit of a hard episode to
[55:14] follow, especially considering the, uh, the name that I gave this was creating a real
[55:14] dash economy.
[55:20] I will, I want to try to do my best to summarize the details that
[55:20] you shared and how that helps with
[55:27] bringing us into a dash economy. And I think what I'm, what I'm hearing is,
[55:27] um, we want to be able to
[55:36] open up dash development to the broad, the huge, broad, um, contingency of web developers.
[55:36] And in
[55:46] order to do that, we need better web tooling and that's what you want to
[55:46] help with. Um, and so, so
[55:54] bringing this blockchain world into the traditional web two world is, is something that we
[55:54] should,
[56:02] we should try to do. And you're trying to help do that. Um, and it,
[56:02] it does get detailed. There are some,
[56:09] uh, some details that we need to flesh out, but anyway, I've got, I've got
[56:09] kids coming in here. So,
[56:17] um, I think we're at about an hour anyway, so let's wrap it up. Um,
[56:17] any final thoughts, AJ?
[56:23] I don't know, man. I like, I, I worked out at the technical layer. It's
[56:23] really hard for me. I don't
[56:29] know how to do this stuff. Like I was, I was really glad when you
[56:29] were, you know, managing the funding
[56:36] issue. Cause that's, that's not where my skill lies. I'm not a politicker. Um, I
[56:36] don't know how to,
[56:41] to navigate the proposal stuff, but I know what we need to do like on
[56:41] a technical level. And if,
[56:46] and if I knew who the audience was, that's the other thing is, you know,
[56:46] if I know that, you know,
[56:51] you're, you're a mom that works in banking or you're a dad that works construction
[56:51] or you're,
[56:55] you know, somebody works in finance. Like I can speak to somebody in a level
[56:55] that they can understand,
[57:01] but when I don't know who the audience is, I like, I ramble way more
[57:01] than, than I do otherwise.
[57:06] Cause I like, how do I present this information to somebody in a way that
[57:06] they can understand?
[57:11] What is the information they want to know? How do I say it in the
[57:11] way that they best understand it?
[57:15] So I like, you know, having to go direct to the proposals, it's cool. It's
[57:15] cool to be able to do
[57:22] it, but also it's a little frustrating. Cause, um, yeah, I don't, I don't know
[57:22] how to communicate
[57:28] this stuff, especially when we're talking protocol layer stuff. And you know, are you going
[57:28] to believe
[57:31] me or are you going to believe DCG? You know, they're going to tell you,
[57:31] no, we don't need to
[57:36] do this stuff. No, we don't need it on the web. No, you know, and
[57:36] I'm saying, no, we do need it on the
[57:39] web. And we, and we, there is a path forward to put on the web
[57:39] and they're saying, no, we can't put
[57:43] it on the web. Cause there's all these reasons to say, you know what, like
[57:43] those, those, like,
[57:47] we can put it on the web and there's easy ways to get around the
[57:47] problems that have traditionally
[57:53] prohibited it from being on the web. We have to make some concessions short term,
[57:57] but it's all about stepping stones, right? You don't, you don't just erupt a skyscraper.
[58:03] You have scaffolding and you build for one and you build for two and you
[58:03] build for three.
[58:07] And in the beginning it's like, oh man, I can't put a, an office on
[58:07] the 18th floor. Cause it's not
[58:12] built yet. Well, yeah, but, but if you build the first floor, you can get
[58:12] to the second floor. Like
[58:16] there's a clear path to be able to have everything on the web and still
[58:16] meet the goals of the verification,
[58:22] the decentralization, the distribution, et cetera. Uh, we just gotta take those first steps there
[58:22] and,
[58:27] and work towards it. And, um, yeah, so that's, that's what I'm hoping for.
[58:32] All right. Well, I think that, uh, for, for you viewers, you, you may see
[58:32] some more proposals coming
[58:39] up from AJ, uh, digital cash dev. Um, and I'm going to do what I
[58:39] can to, to help present those. Um,
[58:49] and I'm also going to try to, uh, find additional developers, but like, like we've
[58:49] said today,
[58:56] it is, it is difficult to attract web developers, uh, without good web tooling. So.
[59:01] And the ramp up time is so long right now. We, we definitely can get
[59:01] it better.
[59:07] Yeah. Okay. Thanks everybody for tuning in. Uh, we'll see you next week and yeah,
[59:07] until then. Bye.
