## Chapters

### 00:00 - 06:00 | Introductions and General Updates

In this opening segment, the hosts greet one another and set the stage for the discussion by explaining the purpose of the call. They briefly summarize key developments across multiple Dash projects and confirm which ones have recently been funded. This lays a foundation for the rest of the conversation, emphasizing the importance of project progress in maintaining a robust and user-friendly Dash ecosystem. Participants also take a moment to acknowledge the latest treasury proposals, offering thanks and congratulations to those whose funding requests successfully passed.

Following these initial remarks, the focus shifts to an overview of how each contributor’s work supports the broader Dash network. The group touches on various tools and services in development, illustrating the synergy between separate projects that all feed into a common goal. Even within these preliminary minutes, they emphasize the importance of collaboration. By underscoring how each initiative interlocks with the next, the discussion sets up a clear roadmap of topics to be explored throughout the rest of the update.

### 06:00 - 12:00 | Platform Explorer Enhancements

During this portion, the conversation dives into new features and UI improvements for Dash Platform Explorer. The speaker highlights fresh changes to identity pages that make it easier for users to see the total balance, transaction history, and data contracts associated with each identity. Specific design elements—such as breadcrumb navigation and detailed credit transfers—are showcased, illustrating how the explorer now presents information more cohesively. These updates not only streamline the user experience but also present data in a developer-friendly manner.

The discussion then turns to advanced functionality like support for different document types, extended transaction details, and more comprehensive contract data. These refinements make it simpler to track, filter, and interpret on-chain activity, fostering a clearer picture of how identities interact within Dash Platform. In emphasizing ease of use, the team underlines that these enhancements are especially beneficial for developers looking to build or audit data-driven applications on Dash.

### 12:00 - 18:00 | Identity and Document Management

Here, the conversation moves on to the improvements in identity verification and document ownership. The team explains how each new interface element, including identity pictures and related metrics, provides clearer insights into user activity. A spotlight is placed on consolidated logs, which detail every instance of document creation, transfer, and revision for a given identity. This level of traceability is meant to improve trust and transparency, helping everyone see exactly how credits, documents, and data contracts evolve over time.

They also examine the user experience of registering and managing platform usernames. While discussing the differences between normalized and non-normalized names, the speakers consider how best to display them on user-facing pages. This segment highlights the intention to keep the system intuitive and accessible, even though the underlying platform mechanics can be complex. By the end of this section, listeners gain a strong sense of the dashboard-like approach guiding future enhancements to identity and document management features.

### 18:00 - 24:00 | Contested Resources and Data Contracts

In this chapter, the team explores contested resources, using username registration conflicts as the primary example. They demonstrate how the explorer’s interface will soon showcase each instance of a contested resource, complete with potential contenders, vote tallies, and status indicators. This ensures that the resolution process is transparent, letting the community see how many votes favor a particular claim and when a final decision might be reached.

The speakers also discuss how these disputed assets fit within data contracts on Dash Platform. They describe ongoing work to make the explorer capable of decoding various contract-specific values, allowing for a broader range of use cases beyond name registration. This expanded functionality points to a future in which any type of contestable digital property—supported by a valid data contract—can be scrutinized through a similar interface. It’s a crucial step in turning Dash into a versatile ecosystem that accommodates more than simple value transfers.

### 24:00 - 30:00 | Electrum Proposal Outcome

Attention shifts to the Electrum project, where the speaker explains the status of a recent proposal that narrowly missed formal funding. Despite falling short, they confirm that essential bug fixes will continue, especially for DIP3 functionalities like registering and managing masternodes. Electrum remains an important wallet option for users who prefer a lightweight approach to interacting with Dash, and its upkeep aligns with overall network objectives.

However, the speaker clarifies that new, more ambitious features—like integrating platform-based identities—will likely require fresh proposals. This ensures that resources are properly allocated for the higher complexity of advanced development tasks. The segment underlines how project teams in the Dash ecosystem often adapt to fluctuating treasury outcomes, using partial or temporary funding where possible while still pushing crucial updates. In maintaining Electrum’s core features, they uphold the reliability users have come to expect.

### 30:00 - 36:00 | Dash Network Treasury Review

Here, the conversation broadens to discuss the overall treasury process, detailing how some proposals pass initial voting yet fail to be funded due to budget constraints. The speakers reference specific proposals that ultimately expired, even though they’d met the threshold for approval. This highlights a common challenge in community-driven budget systems: the final cutoff can leave worthwhile proposals unfunded if higher-ranked projects monopolize the available block reward.

They also delve into how participants might strategize for future funding cycles. Some teams maintain flexible budgets through general-purpose grants or reapply with updated proposals. The conversation underscores the importance of presenting clear plans and leveraging partial funding when feasible. By handling the treasury’s constraints in a methodical way, developers and project managers can keep essential tasks moving forward, even under uncertain funding conditions.

### 36:00 - 42:00 | SDK Challenges and Future Plans

Focus then turns to the JavaScript SDK, which both speakers agree requires significant updates for a smoother development experience. They stress that many ongoing platform projects hinge on this SDK’s stability, from identity management to contested resource resolution. The incomplete or inefficient parts of the code lead to extended load times, complicating the process of syncing documents, headers, and transactions.

Despite these hurdles, they remain optimistic. Contributors like AJ are poised to implement key fixes, although they must navigate the formal review processes. Efforts include refining document transitions, improving proof mechanisms, and optimizing data queries. By striving for robust code and comprehensive test coverage, the team envisions a cleaner development pipeline that can empower both new and seasoned Dash builders.

### 42:00 - 48:00 | Shenmic.dev Authentication Approach

In this segment, the conversation shifts to the shenmik.dev platform, which aims to showcase Dash Platform’s real-world utility by incorporating identity and task management. The speaker presents plans for an authentication system that initially relies on Dash seed phrases, noting that it currently functions in a testnet environment. This approach demonstrates how users might log in with their on-chain identities and perform actions that are then recorded on the platform.

They clarify that while seed phrase entry might not be the long-term production model, it serves as a stepping-stone to more secure methods like wallet connect or hardware signing. The speaker’s ultimate goal is to let developers and organizations orchestrate tasks, comments, and project milestones directly on Dash Platform, offering a tangible blueprint for decentralized application development. It’s a proving ground that highlights both the practicality and flexibility of on-chain governance and data storage.

### 48:00 - 54:00 | Wallet Connect Possibilities

Now the speakers address the idea of integrating Wallet Connect for Dash, focusing on how it might enable secure transactions without exposing private keys in a browser environment. They mention collaboration with Edge Wallet’s development team as a possible route to make Dash the first UTXO chain supported in Wallet Connect. Such an endeavor would let mobile and desktop wallets seamlessly authorize actions on decentralized apps, eliminating the need for less secure methods of key management.

Despite the enthusiasm, they acknowledge that this initiative is not the highest immediate priority. Rather, it forms part of a longer-term vision to create a unified user experience across the Dash ecosystem. By coordinating with outside wallet developers and standardizing on protocols that meet the network’s security requirements, these integrations could eventually streamline everything from identity authentication to instant payments on DApps.

### 54:00 - End | Closing Thoughts and Next Steps

In the final minutes, the hosts wrap up by reiterating the significance of the ongoing developments. They touch on timelines for certain features, acknowledging that some updates depend on code reviews, while others hinge on stable funding. The conversation also revisits how these projects—Platform Explorer, Electrum, and shenmik.dev—interconnect, illustrating a future where Dash’s data and payment layers operate in tandem.

Before signing off, they offer gratitude to community members for their support and invite developers to experiment with the newly refined tools. The speakers highlight an evolving roadmap where each piece, from contested resources to wallet integration, fits into a cohesive vision for the network. By maintaining an active and transparent dialogue, they aim to keep the Dash ecosystem both innovative and responsive to real-world needs.

[00:00] good morning or evening everybody uh welcome to another incubator weekly today we've got
[00:11] uh mikhail with us today to give us uh an update last update for 2024
[00:11] uh how's it going mikhail
[00:17] hey guys it's going good we have uh really a lot of updates on the
[00:17] platform explorer and other
[00:27] projects so i'd like to share with you uh yeah and give updates on my
[00:27] on our work yeah yeah we had an
[00:36] eventful month last month for the treasury fundings i think you had three proposals that
[00:36] passed all of
[00:45] them so congratulations on that and i think we'll be talking a little bit about
[00:45] the uh platform explorer
[00:55] that's that's your main project uh but you also have a general uh shenmick.dev uh
[00:55] website
[01:05] that you have people that can log into um now using dash credentials so we'll
[01:05] talk about that uh we'll
[01:15] we'll cover uh electrum a little bit uh that proposal actually now that i'm thinking
[01:15] about it i think did
[01:22] not pass so i'd like to get your updates on what you plan to do
[01:22] going forward with that how you interpret
[01:29] that vote so yeah i'll just leave it to you at this point uh i've
[01:29] got your screen share so are you ready
[01:36] you ready to go go over that um yeah sure okay
[01:43] so yeah uh the most impactful update i think it's the christmas theme everybody likes
[01:43] it yeah um yeah
[01:55] we added uh we added uh we added uh the snowflakes and also the hats
[01:55] uh on the identity but it's not uh
[02:04] uh only the christmas theme we have already uh implemented the identities on the front
[02:04] end page we
[02:13] reworked it which uh really really well so it now shows a lot of uh
[02:13] interesting info um so we can see
[02:22] the identity it's a picture we can see the total top ups total withdrawals uh
[02:22] the gas uh which account
[02:32] spent on some on on the transactions uh we can even see the public keys
[02:32] that are attached uh to the given
[02:40] identity and there is even uh it even shows you some bindings uh some internal
[02:40] uh access control on of
[02:50] the identity public keys uh well i don't know where to find it right now
[02:50] but uh there is additionally
[02:59] a box where uh it shows you for which data contracts and which data or
[02:59] which data contracts uh and
[03:07] document types uh can be used uh with this given uh identity public key okay
[03:07] so just a little bit of a
[03:15] backing up a little bit this what we're looking at right here if you could
[03:15] scroll to the top this is an
[03:21] identity this is the identity page so we're on a specific identity what what specific
[03:21] identity is this
[03:28] um i don't know okay just a random one okay yeah but i can show
[03:28] you the identity of our front ender
[03:38] one second um there we go so i see also in the in the top
[03:38] navigation you've got a little uh what what
[03:52] we call a breadcrumb um feature so where so which will be either entities into
[03:52] a specific identities
[04:00] you can go back and forth yeah yeah so we do visa for people to
[04:00] navigate uh on the website uh especially
[04:09] on some some deep you know nesting where for example the contested resources where we
[04:09] have data
[04:16] contract the contract documents some documents have contested states so yeah so this is the
[04:16] identity of
[04:25] our front ender uh alexei.dash it's in the testnet all of the changes are right
[04:25] now in the testnet but
[04:31] i'm going to roll out uh on the mainnet uh this night because it requires
[04:31] re-indexing okay so this is
[04:39] coming we're looking at testnet right now but very soon after yeah 24 hours from
[04:39] now everybody should
[04:44] be able to see this this page um yeah so uh what we have here
[04:44] is uh um we can see um all of the
[04:58] transactions we have we can see the data contract that identity owns uh we can
[04:58] see which documents uh
[05:04] was submitted by the given identity and its credit transfers and first uh credit transfers
[05:04] uh starts
[05:13] with identity create which is very useful because uh we can see literally like the
[05:13] balance uh where
[05:22] it's coming yeah yeah yeah the whole history um and so these are all these
[05:22] are these would be data
[05:29] contracts and documents that the identity owns not just has participated in right like if
[05:29] i if i have an
[05:38] an identity that has um submitted uh well i guess um would there be anything
[05:38] where there's an interaction
[05:49] that you don't own that would not show up on this page like if you
[05:49] commented on some um board or something
[05:57] you would own that as well though would you not uh like the document yeah
[05:57] if you comment if you make a
[06:04] document on somebody else's contract that they own would that show up here uh yeah
[06:04] it will show it will
[06:10] show it to show every document that uh this identity owns so as long as
[06:10] he owns uh this document uh it will
[06:18] be shown here okay so pretty much all every at all activity that that you
[06:18] have done you should be able
[06:24] to get to from this exactly exactly uh it's actually uh the most viewed page
[06:24] uh on the platform floor i
[06:35] checked recently um so the most uh active pages are home and identity pages identities
[06:35] the list of the
[06:44] identities and the specific identity okay cool people i thought it would be the validators
[06:44] but yeah that
[06:51] surprised me interesting um yeah so uh another yet big feature that we was able
[06:51] to submit is the
[07:01] transactions details page which now has a lot of a lot of info uh it's
[07:01] where you zoom in a little bit
[07:11] so uh yeah um so it shows almost everything right now it still misses some
[07:11] specific details in the in
[07:21] the document transition actions but it's already a lot of info like uh there are
[07:21] a lot of info very
[07:28] useful for developers like uh transaction signatures um yeah so if somebody working on the
[07:28] sdk i think that
[07:38] will be very useful for them uh on the transitions we can see the data
[07:38] which was posted by the given
[07:46] identity we can see uh the inside identifier you know the data contract identifier
[07:53] um yeah uh there are some so it's uh and it's implemented for every state
[07:53] transition but it's currently
[08:04] missing some few very interesting uh details like contested resourcing for like refinding voting balance
[08:12] or maybe it's already implemented under mobile no i think it's not um something about
[08:12] voting uh so
[08:20] we will edit to uh very very shortly uh so it's basically dependent on the
[08:20] sdk's uh so there are some
[08:29] data data not available in sdk so i have to make a pull request to
[08:29] the platform
[08:33] actually we're using our own branch but anyway uh it involves uh working on sdk
[08:33] on this sdk as well
[08:49] uh yeah so uh there are a lot of uh internal uh work on some
[08:49] details uh on the identity and
[09:01] introduction details page so for example uh the identities uh names we can now see
[09:01] which i was owned which one was
[09:13] was blocked for example let's see uh google dot i will not show you uh
[09:13] yeah so uh because it was locked
[09:27] uh yeah yeah so we can see some locked uh names and even if you
[09:27] just uh acquired uh just registered uh the
[09:53] contested name uh you will see it's yellow uh and it will show a circle
[09:53] like it will show like it is
[10:00] spending okay so everything in gray is is owned and you actually successfully acquired that
[10:00] username
[10:14] um probably we should have uh probably we should have uh colored as green by
[10:14] the way i just thought about that
[10:19] but yeah so now no confusions on when you open your identity name now you
[10:19] can clearly see
[10:28] uh the whole ongoing process you know and yeah and that's very very good
[10:36] um yeah so what we're going to do next uh on the front end we
[10:36] will jump on the data contracts uh on the
[10:45] blocks and we will we are going to implement contested resources which should show every
[10:45] info about
[10:52] contested resources uh just like we have on dash dot vault um yeah we already
[10:52] have a designs uh but let me
[11:02] start from other pages first like uh the blog uh on the data contract to
[11:02] show you what it's going to be
[11:09] look like
[11:10] yeah
[11:24] so yeah uh our page is uh looking similarly uh so and that's good yes
[11:24] we have a week some kind of
[11:33] boxes and uh yeah there are a lot of info um we have identifier of
[11:33] our data contract who owns it uh
[11:42] what's the revision is it uh when it was created uh we can see the
[11:42] total transactions uh related to
[11:49] the given uh data contract we can see all of the documents related to the
[11:49] given contract uh the top
[11:56] identity which is uh like uh was interacting with this uh data contract uh the
[11:56] most you know the most
[12:05] active identity who was interacting with this data contract um is this data contract that
[12:05] we're looking
[12:12] at is this is this the dcg dpns i don't think no i don't think
[12:12] so everything on design is mocked so it's
[12:20] just all right all right yeah so and the total gas spent uh and average
[12:20] gas spent uh during transactions
[12:28] on this uh data contract uh we can also see all of the transactions that
[12:28] was uh happening uh on this data
[12:37] contract i can see the documents that was uh posted uh in it uh if
[12:37] document have different uh document types uh in the schema
[12:47] you can also see the different uh yeah different uh document types uh later all
[12:47] of the
[12:55] lists uh will receive a filter tooltip so it will be also possible to filter
[12:55] data like by owner id by transaction hash
[13:05] identifier whatever like caskis if we want to see which like the most uh the
[13:05] most expensive transactions
[13:16] happening from this data contract and stuff like that okay um i have a question
[13:16] from the last uh if you
[13:25] could go back to the testnet uh platform explorer again is there is there a
[13:25] view where you can see
[13:33] all of the registered platform usernames and aliases all in one list uh no no
[13:33] not yet okay not yet uh yeah
[13:46] we also not showing documents right now um we can think about that yeah it
[13:46] was it was in my head a couple
[13:54] times so okay yeah because it would be interesting to be able to to go
[13:54] to one page where it had
[14:04] you know obviously at some point it would have to be a paginated um page
[14:04] but you know the one of the
[14:13] nicest features of a browser is ctrl f you know if you could just go
[14:13] to that page and uh kind of look
[14:20] through and see what kind of usernames are being uh registered all in one page
[14:20] i think that would be
[14:25] that would be a nice feature at some point yeah yeah okay cool now as
[14:25] i'm looking at that the list there
[14:35] the api do you know of anybody who's using the the api because i am
[14:35] curious to see not yet not yet but i think
[14:45] it's very useful will be later uh for uh for showing people the data on
[14:45] the decentralized applications
[14:54] applications until they're logged in because in order for you to acquire documents and verify
[14:54] them
[15:01] with the proofs right you need to synchronize your wallet you need to download all
[15:01] of the lmq headers or
[15:09] the worms so if you are not logged in so you should be still be
[15:09] able to to view the data
[15:20] uh on on on your digital as app so i think it will it will
[15:20] be usable as a backing point as a fallback
[15:27] api uh for sure making this uh in that case like for example on our
[15:27] diffuse website i think we will
[15:34] we will be using that uh later okay great um all right so we looked
[15:34] at the the platform explorer
[15:45] i'm trying to think if i have any um have any questions about this uh
[15:45] this has always been
[15:51] very useful site so it's been a while since i've used it honestly because i've
[15:51] been waiting to see
[16:00] how things shake out with without how things were going to shake out with the
[16:00] sdk development things like
[16:06] that before i really got too far into developing again on dash platform but um
[16:13] yeah do you do you have anything else to say on using the platform explorer.com
[16:13] site or should we move
[16:25] on to the next thing that you had on your list um yeah i have
[16:25] i have i have some couple screens that i
[16:31] want to show you as well it's uh about the specific block and the constant
[16:31] contested resources so
[16:38] so give us an example of a contested resource i think there's one primary one
[16:38] but
[16:44] um yeah we will go we will note it like um let me just show
[16:44] you first uh this one
[16:54] um yeah uh we we also need to rework the the blog details page so
[16:54] it will show you the transactions
[17:05] that uh was included in in the blog and the very cool thing that we
[17:05] can actually see information about
[17:14] the quorum so we can see the quorum hash we can see the app hash
[17:14] up hash is like the hash of the state of
[17:23] the growth db of the drive which changes each block so we can see the
[17:23] protocol version of the blog uh
[17:32] it's block version which i believe is the tetherdash block version um yeah and uh
[17:32] what is the what is the
[17:41] apoc uh what is the quorum index uh which was uh used when when we
[17:41] when the the block was finalized
[17:51] here the total fees the validator who picked up this block uh produced i mean
[17:51] yeah so and the cool thing
[18:01] about decorum index uh about the forum yeah so we can see uh where like
[18:01] uh where on the core explorer we
[18:12] this block was accepted like uh this forum index we should uh be able to
[18:12] see which next uh forum will
[18:21] be happening and stuff like that which is total valid members if there are any
[18:21] failure failures so
[18:29] i think it will be very useful in case some potential change stalls uh even
[18:29] for like
[18:37] platform team who you know debugging all the situations in the in the highway so
[18:37] yeah this is one of the
[18:46] the pages that we are going to reward yeah i was just going to ask
[18:46] is is this one of the pages that will
[18:52] be uh on mainnet in a day or is this something that isn't even on
[18:52] testnet yet it's uh it's not in the
[19:01] testament yet yeah it's the pages that we are going to work um soon to
[19:01] the january okay so it's the block
[19:09] it's the block page and it is a specific document page i believe yeah um
[19:09] the same thing about the document
[19:21] uh so we detalized it as we could we included also the prefinding voting balance
[19:21] so if the document was
[19:31] as a content was contested resource uh submitted as contested resource so we can see
[19:31] how much credits was
[19:42] was unlocked and yeah uh this is the transactions uh of these documents so the
[19:42] document can be replaced can
[19:52] be deleted can be transferred so it's just the history of this document okay yeah
[19:52] and the most interesting
[20:01] one i think for all of you guys it's the contested resources yeah so an
[20:01] example of this would be the dash pay
[20:11] user names yeah the dash pay user names identity names uh dpns names or uh
[20:11] so how it's called so
[20:20] yeah this page will show all of the active uh contested resources uh happening right
[20:20] now uh in the network
[20:28] so we can see all of them we can see the resource value uh this
[20:28] page was designed not uh specifically for
[20:40] identity names but it works for all of the data contracts that could be potentially
[20:40] built uh on the
[20:47] platform uh chain so like uh the resource value we can decode it for dpns
[20:47] contracts but for for some
[20:57] other data contracts uh it will show the view the raw value like in base
[20:57] uh 64. um yeah we can zoom in just a little bit on that again
[21:08] yeah so dpns uh data contracts have some predefined schema of the index values uh
[21:08] on index name that uh we are
[21:22] just locking our credits on so um there is like specific format which describes uh
[21:22] which which domain name uh this
[21:34] uh this identity acquiring and which uh parent domain name is being used so there
[21:34] are like three parameters
[21:43] like uh the type the the domain name the parent domain name or i don't
[21:43] remember exactly so anyway uh we can
[21:52] only decode it for the dpns uh data contract right now but it's only ddpns
[21:52] uh data contract in mainnet right
[21:59] now uh which uses the contested resource feature uh in the testing there are three
[21:59] um okay and do you do
[22:10] you have an estimate on when people can expect this page to be live either
[22:10] on testnet or mainnet
[22:17] um i don't know it depends on the on the development on the sdks because
[22:17] uh okay but this one this one's
[22:27] still an active development then yeah yeah it's like i mean itself uh the protocol
[22:27] like the condition
[22:36] resource is implemented but yeah it's on for the developers of the decentralized applications to
[22:42] implement so okay now i know there have been a lot of questions and there's
[22:42] been some confusing confusion
[22:48] about uh usernames you know you see usernames that are presented as when you register
[22:48] a username if i
[22:58] register ryan rion um i'm also going to get r10n for example um and the
[22:58] page that uh the mno watch page
[23:14] and some other pages as well they default to showing like i would consider the
[23:14] more non-intuitive one
[23:22] like not the one that they are asking for that has uh normalized letters yeah
[23:22] yeah most people most people
[23:33] are trying to get the one that has letters and not numbers but it seems
[23:33] like most of the interfaces
[23:40] are showing the ones that have that are normalized down to uh numbers is there
[23:40] any reason that you would
[23:49] not show the one like the default page that has letters instead or can you
[23:49] talk about that well well
[23:57] yeah and i agree with you that uh people should see the resource value like
[23:57] uh um what they are
[24:05] what they are trying to pick up so yeah we will we'll think how we
[24:05] will implement it so
[24:16] we can show with normalize but resource value i think it's already unnormalized so we
[24:16] should uh
[24:21] do that in reverse like kind of normalized into into the default one yeah and
[24:21] i i can't really see
[24:31] if you could zoom in a little bit more i'm not sure which one is
[24:31] the resource value okay so this this
[24:36] looks like these are these are defaulting to uh it's just a mock yeah it's
[24:36] just a mock
[24:47] but when we will go into it we will we will have better understanding how
[24:47] we're going to implement
[24:52] because as i remember the resource value is already a normalized uh domain name so
[24:52] it's something like
[24:59] that yeah so and i don't i don't i don't know what the specific terminology
[24:59] is referring to yeah yeah but
[25:06] but the one that the defaults the one that shows letters i think is the
[25:06] is the better one to show by
[25:11] default maybe yeah i agree over it you can show that you're getting the numbers
[25:11] also but
[25:16] yeah it's just an interesting design decision uh to make that those numbers instead anyway
[25:16] um moving on
[25:26] but what do you have for us um so yeah um and we can see
[25:26] what votes was uh assigning to to the each uh
[25:37] resource like uh how many how many votes we have how many agrees we have
[25:37] how many abstains how many logs we
[25:43] have um and in case the contested resource have different contenders which uh uh wants
[25:43] to pick up this uh
[25:54] for example sky dot dash yeah uh we can see this nice interface for it
[25:54] shows us like
[26:02] and the progress the progress the progress it's very very nice yeah and we can
[26:02] see when the voting should
[26:09] end uh what's the status uh in case it's uh it was locked it will
[26:09] show you as locked and it will show you
[26:18] all of the votes count that happened to to this document
[26:25] yeah this is awesome i i'm very much looking forward to this this is something
[26:25] that we
[26:30] we really need uh before we can onboard too many users let alone developers
[26:35] yeah i agree so yeah and the list where you can uh see all the
[26:35] votes you can filter them by towards
[26:45] identity abstain locked and stuff like that okay so yeah i think there will be
[26:45] even one more page uh called
[26:54] master node votes uh which i will allow you to see the votes happening right
[26:54] now in the platform chain
[27:02] and filter them by some specific data contracts by specific identities um yeah but we
[27:02] we haven't designed it
[27:12] okay um yeah uh so um i think that's it for the platform explorer uh
[27:12] let me get to the to the electrum um
[27:27] um yeah so uh
[27:34] not this one sorry
[27:41] um um yeah uh so we um we have couple of issues uh in the
[27:41] electrum and uh we actually received some
[27:56] some feature requests from some of the investors i think uh so there was one
[27:56] guy who wanted to set up
[28:06] um um even note but he had like uh really poor internet connection he couldn't
[28:06] just he didn't want
[28:15] to synchronize the dash core but uh it seems like there is no way to
[28:15] register an eva node
[28:22] unless you are using the dash car because we have uh dash master node oh
[28:22] sorry uh dash in dmt yeah that dash
[28:33] dash master node too but it only works with the hardware was uh so
[28:38] so yeah that was uh kind of fast and we looked through the through the
[28:38] current issues so we decided to
[28:47] get into it there is actually uh uh it's actually the implementation of the master
[28:47] nodes uh it's not quite
[28:57] working uh right now in the electrum like it's not working all the way uh
[28:57] we checked what's what's going
[29:06] on there was really a lot of research because um the electrum while it was
[29:06] returning us uh a year
[29:14] when we tried to register with the existing collateral so it seems there was some
[29:14] problem with the messaging
[29:21] um like the signing uh of the transactions uh we fixed that um so we
[29:21] looked into another issue which uh i
[29:31] was thinking that is related but it turned out it's uh not related and uh
[29:31] yeah it also does not work
[29:41] because uh i don't know what's happened maybe it wasn't working at all i don't
[29:41] know so yeah the update
[29:49] service uh is broken and we wanted to go through it and fix everything actually
[29:49] we will fix uh the all
[29:57] the deep free features like uh registering faster nodes and updating the services uh to
[29:57] let users keep
[30:05] master nodes into the electric wallet yeah okay i see a bit three that that
[30:05] should be dip three right
[30:13] yeah yeah let's okay just making sure um yeah and another another thing that could
[30:13] be very interesting
[30:22] for the electron is maybe it's worth trying to implement most uh platform identities straight
[30:22] into
[30:28] the electron wallet because later we would we would like to have a feature from
[30:28] the web browser to sign
[30:37] off other transactions in the external while it's not in the browser itself so you
[30:37] don't load the private
[30:42] keys uh straight into the browser or browser extension so i think uh yeah so
[30:42] if we would like to sign
[30:55] the platform transactions uh from the electron so we would need to implement uh platform
[30:55] identities which
[31:02] is also sticked to the seed phrase uh which is just in different storage index
[31:02] so it's basically i think
[31:11] it's uh it would be very useful for the next you know for the for
[31:11] the platform network so you you could
[31:18] use the electron for signing your platform transactions in the browser yeah that's what we
[31:18] wanted to do
[31:25] um unfortunately our last proposal didn't pass sure it shorted like not really a lot
[31:25] of votes so
[31:34] it seems like the network still i think uh supports this project it just just
[31:34] didn't have uh enough
[31:41] space in the in the last uh cycle in the last proposal yeah i did
[31:41] want to talk about that so i might as
[31:50] well talk about it now while while it's on subject um i'll go ahead and
[31:50] share my screen for a little bit
[31:55] okay so so this is the this is the state of the funding and the
[31:55] voting the main treasury voting uh at
[32:08] the time at the time that it closed so you can see this is mnowash.org
[32:08] slash leaderboard slash a specific
[32:15] date um and you can see 7.9 minutes remaining that was the last snapshot before
[32:15] at the at the snapshot at
[32:24] the voting deadline and as you can see here this you know these these check
[32:24] marks um that shows what was
[32:32] both had the required votes and the required funding uh budget available um and your
[32:32] electrum proposal was
[32:44] just shy of the passing criteria at the time as well as um aj's sdk
[32:44] platform id explorer with explorer proposal
[32:59] but what's interesting is just um just before some of these proposals expired um they
[32:59] actually came
[33:11] within funding uh or within passing criteria so your electrum proposal uh is currently passing
[33:11] by voting
[33:23] criteria uh as well as you know funding but not but it's it's expired so
[33:23] this this uh wilted flower means
[33:32] that even though it's got the right it's got the amount of votes that it
[33:32] needs it's got the funding
[33:36] that it needs it doesn't have it's it's it's an expired proposal so that happens
[33:36] now with uh your proposal as
[33:44] well as um well as um well this one's passing still and that one's still
[33:44] active but aj's um web sdk
[33:52] also has is in passing criteria or at least was before it expired just recently
[33:52] so i kind of have to
[34:00] figure out how to interpret this as well and obviously the easiest way is to
[34:00] to put in another proposal for
[34:08] for next month um but with you and with with me we both have organizations
[34:08] that
[34:15] kind of have general funding available um or at least you can you can uh
[34:15] you can correct me if i'm wrong on that
[34:26] um the ideal is to have proposals that have funding specifically for a specific project
[34:26] but in the
[34:35] case of the incubator you know i have some funds that are available for any
[34:35] kind of general case use
[34:40] so i need to figure out what to do but what are you going to
[34:40] do uh with with this uh
[34:48] funding for uh the the electrum project yeah um so um yeah we will continue
[34:48] working we will continue
[34:58] we will fix the current deep free implementation which is master notes uh just master
[34:58] notes without evo
[35:04] notes but regarding the evo notes or potential platform identities into into electrum i think
[35:04] it will
[35:12] require the separate proposal so we just need more funds uh so you're going to
[35:12] continue to do but would
[35:23] it be safe to say you're going to continue to do bug fixes regardless of
[35:23] what happens
[35:28] okay new features will require a funded proposal um which you may or may not
[35:28] submit this coming cycle
[35:41] okay um anything else to say about electrum or do you want to move on
[35:41] to uh shenmik.dev website
[35:49] not much um only one thing i checked uh the traffic on the electron website
[35:49] and uh it shows pretty pretty
[36:00] much amount of traffic so like uh 1000 requests each day or stuff like that
[36:00] so i think it's pretty pretty much
[36:07] i'm going to go ahead and check it out so people are visiting the website
[36:07] you can see that there is some
[36:13] traffic yep so i'll go ahead and um i want to show that real quick
[36:13] because i have something else to say
[36:21] about that uh let's see let's go back to my screen and we have uh
[36:21] we went over these this is the dash hyphen
[36:34] and you have a little call out here that says there's a fake electrum dash
[36:34] website uh with unknown
[36:47] binaries uh this wrong make sure that you're on one of the correct websites and
[36:47] url matches one of these
[36:55] legit domains so these are the three these three domains are all uh controlled by
[36:55] you these are all good domains
[37:03] electrum hyphen dash dot com dash electrum dot com and dash electrum dot org so
[37:03] you have these two both
[37:11] the com and the org but there's one that's electrum hyphen dash dot org electrum
[37:11] hyphen dash dot org not dash
[37:21] hyphen electrum dot org which is the one that we're on right now that is
[37:21] a scam and they were referring back to
[37:29] the code base a code base from uh my the incubator code base on github
[37:29] we've since uh archived that
[37:39] site so everybody just know that these are the three legit domains and anything else
[37:39] is could be a scam
[37:48] i just wanted to call that out because that's something that happened since our last
[37:48] update
[37:53] uh yeah yeah yeah i forgot anything else about that well yeah it's kind of
[37:53] upset that such thing happens
[38:02] but yeah we have some kind of people who cloning electron dash so just be
[38:02] aware and but it's actually
[38:11] very noticeable yeah okay the wrong but the uh the site that you were talking
[38:11] about that's getting like a
[38:17] thousand um hits yeah yeah this this website yeah like one thousand requests yeah each
[38:17] day what was
[38:26] that per day or month or what per day per day per day okay one
[38:26] thousand requests per day that seems like
[38:33] people are still looking into this it's good that they're going to the right website
[38:33] uh for those uh
[38:38] one thousand requests it's the number from the birth cell i don't know what it
[38:38] means but i think it's
[38:42] it's request all of the resources yeah and some of those could be just bots
[38:42] just images later on yeah
[38:49] okay um and then you've got this uh shenmik.dev website yeah do you want to
[38:49] say anything about this
[38:59] because one of the one of the features i've i'm following your github activity and
[38:59] i've seen uh
[39:06] a feature where you're you're you're doing logging in with um seed phrases or what
[39:06] exactly how are you
[39:15] going to do your authentication tell us tell us about this website in general and
[39:15] give us some background
[39:22] and then what features you're working on yeah so um can you turn up my
[39:22] share screen yes i will show you
[39:31] some of the some of this so the dto website uh the chairman.dev um is
[39:31] a project that should show all of
[39:38] the current capabilities uh of the dish platform in the web so what we are
[39:38] going to do is is we are going
[39:48] to put every data that being shown on our website uh in the chain we
[39:48] will have some kind of flow for
[39:58] paying out the developer it will work through nfts uh features on the dash platform
[39:58] so it should show
[40:06] everything what should be possible in the in the platform chain yeah the first thing
[40:06] that uh we was
[40:14] that we done uh is the basically an authentication through the dash seed phrase um
[40:14] let me just get
[40:25] quickly uh the seed phrase that was used um in the development
[40:31] yeah this is it so people are could be putting their attention to the bottom
[40:31] left corner
[40:42] imports to your dad yeah yeah so if we compare uh the production website so
[40:42] there is no box like that
[40:53] this is a new feature so you can see it on every on every page
[40:53] and when you click on that uh you will see
[41:01] some kind of uh window which allows you to use your seed phrase or private
[41:01] key uh to authenticate on the
[41:11] website so we will put our seed phrase and uh we are starting loading uh
[41:11] the transactions that was
[41:22] like the current balance uh your information about your identities and stuff like that okay
[41:22] so always
[41:31] goes without saying but i always want to say it anyway um that was the
[41:31] seed phrase that you don't really care
[41:36] about nobody should be displaying seed phrases but what do you say in general to
[41:36] people who say you should
[41:43] never enter a seed phrase to any website um um i will say that this
[41:43] project will will be in the testnet for
[41:54] quite a while until dash sdk will receive uh production ready until dash sdk will
[41:54] be production ready for
[42:01] the bandnet so all of the data that we are going to put here will
[42:01] be in the testnet for a while
[42:07] until we get uh proofs in the sdk so yeah
[42:13] uh so is this intended to be then um a feature that is permanent or
[42:13] are you saying that this will
[42:23] eventually uh entering seed phrases or private keys into the website uh no i think
[42:23] i think i think later
[42:31] it will work through the extension which will be able to connect with your mobile
[42:31] wallet or connect with
[42:37] the electron just like while it connect you know so it's also i think that
[42:37] i'm researching uh unfortunately
[42:46] we had an error um uh during the scene and it happens in production bundle
[42:46] it works locally i just remember
[42:56] about it um yeah okay so let me let me check yeah i don't know
[42:56] some there's some error in the bundle
[43:09] which i don't know what is happening
[43:11] um one second i just wanted to show sure so what you're talking about is
[43:26] um you've got this website working locally but when you build the site for a
[43:26] production
[43:32] uh for production deployment that you're uh hosting on this versell.app site
[43:39] yeah that's things yeah don't always
[43:42] yeah so it doesn't work for the reason i don't know something in the awesome
[43:42] so
[43:51] some parameter gets passed uh incorrectly or stuff like that but it only happens
[43:56] on the very cell in a way um so we decided to just go ahead
[43:56] for now but we will fix it
[44:03] okay so now we're looking at localhost this is your development server that we're looking
[44:03] at now
[44:10] but same same application mm-hmm yes what's taking what we're taking so long for the
[44:10] loading
[44:19] so unfortunately uh dash is the key is an stv wallet so it has to
[44:19] load everything from the network it
[44:28] should uh search every like every block for transactions that happen congee wallet so it
[44:28] happens
[44:35] through the dapi endpoints yeah um it's pretty much uh takes time um and it's
[44:35] not very efficient but it is what it is right now
[44:47] uh yeah so you are using the js sdk right now that's beta alpha whatever
[44:47] we want to call it yeah
[44:56] then it uses an spv wallet for syncing
[45:02] yeah something is happening uh is not happening
[45:05] yeah we've talked about it before the the sdk is a big issue right now
[45:05] and we're not sure exactly how
[45:17] that's going to be resolved but as far as we know uh dcg is aware
[45:17] of the issues um and they are redesigning
[45:25] uh javascript sdk right now like i talked about earlier we i may i may
[45:25] go ahead and have aj
[45:34] do some of the scope of work that he was planning on doing with his
[45:34] proposal um and funding that through
[45:44] my budget while also having a proposal for his own proposal i would like that
[45:44] to be network approved
[45:53] um so we'll we'll see what's gonna happen there but i will probably update people
[46:01] and while you're still working with this i'll just also say that uh next year
[46:01] uh starting in next week
[46:09] or potentially the week after i'm going to try to i'm probably going to be
[46:09] moving incubator weekly we're
[46:17] doing it on friday right now just because of the holidays but uh i'll probably
[46:17] be moving it to
[46:22] wednesday at 17 o'clock utc so five o'clock utc pm um i think that might
[46:22] be a better time for
[46:32] for doing that in the future just as a announcement there
[46:36] okay so i think it worked i think it worked uh let's wait okay yeah
[46:36] we're up to 97 now that's better
[46:46] better than seven or eight or nine or whatever it was
[46:48] and it's going um
[46:58] yeah it's right it currently loads uh the transactions and block headers as well but
[46:58] uh i can make a
[47:07] modification in just uh sdk wallet which will disable the block headers uh retrieving which
[47:07] takes really a lot
[47:15] of time much more than the transactions and it should be better but anyway we
[47:15] have some kind of checkpoints
[47:23] that we have to uh that we have to set like from which point will
[47:23] this the sync will will be happening
[47:33] um okay so we we we got it uh you got logged in that's the
[47:33] bottom line here so some things to work
[47:41] out but tell us now what people would do after they're logged in so we're
[47:41] going to be logging into
[47:50] this like give us a little high level overview of what's going on here who's
[47:50] this site so right now i'm
[47:55] logged in as an admin uh so i will be able to make a new
[47:55] project or make a new tasks or review the claims on the
[48:03] projects uh the regular user will be able to comment uh to comment the projects
[48:03] the tasks they will be able to
[48:15] make make make some kind of voting up voting you know like uh make some
[48:15] pluses and minuses
[48:21] um let me show you i think there's some designs uh comments are voting yeah
[48:21] so for example
[48:32] we will have the projects for example electron dash we will see a list of
[48:32] tasks uh assigned for somebody uh we can
[48:44] see the replies you will be able uh to make a comment uh so to
[48:44] do that you will be you will need to
[48:52] authenticate with your dash wallet uh to do that okay yeah and just uh in
[48:52] case people didn't really
[48:59] catch the context here this is essentially you're going to be doing on platform what
[48:59] we've been doing in
[49:07] in the incubator on trello yeah something seems the concepts are similar i just took
[49:07] some ideas like uh
[49:15] uh on some recurrent uh projects you know stuff like that so yeah i i
[49:15] got a lot of ideas from
[49:23] ideas from from the way inco better works in the trello yeah and this this
[49:23] is great because this this was
[49:31] kind of uh you know our hopes and plans for a long time and i'm
[49:31] glad that you're doing it because you
[49:37] got a lot of experience with working with platform obviously and you know when you
[49:37] when you get this
[49:42] working i think that it would be great to have um to be able to
[49:42] use this as a template for other
[49:50] organizations that may want to do something similar including my own but that's right that's
[49:50] right
[49:57] yep okay um and then did you have anything to say about wallet connect as
[49:57] well or um i would like to
[50:04] say uh to i would like to make some words about the sdk so i
[50:04] mentioned that uh i will be able to cut out
[50:12] some inefficient part in the js sdk so it's uh actually one of the things
[50:12] that i'm working on
[50:19] uh is a res uh just uh dash sdk and um there are some things
[50:19] that's still missing like uh there are
[50:28] some document transitions are not implemented in the bus and dpp um so what i
[50:28] did is i finished the
[50:38] transfer document uh transition uh let me show you so platform pull requests uh yeah
[50:38] i just submitted it
[50:49] um yeah so previously it wasn't possible to make document transfers uh with the js
[50:49] sdk and now we have
[51:03] first successful transactions in such transactions in the testnet um yeah we can see uh
[51:03] document identifier
[51:12] who received uh this document yeah there is still two things two transitions uh missing
[51:12] uh i'm going to
[51:22] do them as soon as i finish the first one the document transfer i need
[51:22] to lay out all of
[51:29] uh i need i need to receive a code review you know and okay so
[51:29] yeah this is this is work that you're
[51:39] you're doing uh on platform itself on the sdk itself so once you've got this
[51:39] code reviewed by dcg
[51:48] and merged in it will be available for anybody using the alpha js sdk hopefully
[51:48] in the 1.8
[51:58] okay um yeah so yeah the most uh like i need to finish this one
[51:58] um uh so uh make changes to all of the
[52:14] pull request but the others will be much quicker like there is missing update price
[52:14] and the purchase
[52:19] document i think it will be much quicker and yeah there is some other missing
[52:19] uh parts like
[52:28] in the vasem itself like in the in the vasem method uh getters from the
[52:28] front end so while we are working
[52:35] on the transaction details there are some fields that we need to get through the
[52:35] transactions uh where
[52:43] was it uh extra methods uh that's for me that's thank you oriented um yeah
[52:43] it's like uh some
[52:56] informations about action types um fee information like user fee increase signatures public eids
[53:03] providing voting balance some nonsense uh information and identity contract notes so yeah there will
[53:03] be
[53:12] also the entropy that was used uh during creation of the document that some kind
[53:12] of uh random data
[53:22] yeah so yeah so yeah i still work on it um my plan is to
[53:22] finish with the bindings for document transitions
[53:33] that we will be able to use in our framework.devdfo website okay all right anything
[53:33] else um
[53:44] yeah uh so we wanted to talk about wallet connect a little bit so um
[53:44] i still researching it so the
[53:54] progress uh is still still at the point that i was describing in my in
[53:54] my last proposal so
[54:05] uh uh which proposal was that under uh sorry which proposal you said you were
[54:05] just you described it um i
[54:13] think uh uh it was in my defio proposal this year reserve funding yeah so
[54:13] um this one here yeah
[54:23] i'll do a find for um yeah so basically um connect yeah
[54:34] basically joel asked me to look into it and um the wallet wallet connect itself
[54:34] uh the wallet connect
[54:44] uh protocol itself added some changes in their specifications to allow uh utx utxo chains
[54:44] uh to
[54:52] implement in wallet connect but there is still missing sdk's and there is still a
[54:52] missing implementation in the
[54:59] wallets so um so we picked up um picked up um picked up the wallet
[54:59] the edge wallet uh which is open source
[55:11] that we can build ourselves and joel connected with the developers and uh we like
[55:11] in touch uh
[55:18] to to make it as uh first implementation of uh utxo chain will be and
[55:18] it will be the dash so there is no
[55:27] no support of any bitcoins litecoins in the wallet connect so as as soon as
[55:27] uh we will we will finish
[55:34] the dash uh in the wallet connect in the in the edge wallet yeah it
[55:34] will be the first utx chain to
[55:43] appear in the wallet connect hopefully hopefully yeah but we will do it anyway um
[55:43] it's kind of not in the
[55:50] first priority priorities um but we will do it anyway because we need that for
[55:50] our platform extension uh to
[55:59] work with with our decentralized applications okay because because we don't want to put private
[55:59] keys into
[56:06] the web browser environment um yeah stuff like that uh i think uh that that's
[56:06] it okay oh yeah yeah uh
[56:18] thanks for the thanks for the updates there was a lot of good stuff there
[56:18] um
[56:26] and if anybody has any questions throw them in right now but i i don't
[56:26] see any questions right now um
