## Episode Description

A comprehensive discussion about retaining a key developer for Dash, exploring budget considerations, technical trade-offs, and the broader goal of making Dash more accessible to web developers.

## Episode Summary

This transcript centers on a proposed plan to retain developer AJ for Dash, examining how his work could streamline development tools and enhance accessibility for various programming communities. The speaker addresses ongoing budget constraints, highlights how AJ’s projects fit alongside multiple Dash Core Group proposals, and compares different ways to utilize the treasury effectively. There is a focus on bridging Rust- and TypeScript-based approaches, referencing examples from the JavaScript world to illustrate the importance of contributor-friendly tooling. The discussion underscores the complexity of Dash’s evolution (“Evo”) features, clarifies how strategic proposals aim to simplify developer interaction, and emphasizes the need for a balanced approach that weighs financial reserves against robust ecosystem growth. Overall, the conversation encourages community members to consider the technical merits of AJ’s proposals, the broader development landscape, and practical outcomes for Dash’s future.

## Chapters

### 00:00 - 07:00 | Opening Remarks and Proposal Background

In the first segment, the host greets viewers and notes the slightly irregular schedule for “Incubator Weekly,” acknowledging recent breaks. He explains the purpose of this solo episode: to review the “Retain AJ” governance proposal designed to keep a seasoned developer engaged in Dash projects. By briefly recounting the background, he reminds listeners that AJ’s previous proposals failed to secure funding, largely due to personal disputes rather than the technical merits of his work. The speaker sets the stage for a renewed request to consider AJ’s value to Dash.

Moving on, he clarifies that AJ’s proposed scope of work, initially spread over two-month projects, could now be completed within a single month due to Dash’s price increase. He underscores how personal conflicts overshadowed AJ’s technical contributions, urging masternode owners to separate personality issues from the code itself. Emphasizing the overarching goal of making Dash more developer-friendly, the host suggests that AJ’s skill set holds unique value, especially for those aiming to build streamlined applications and tools.

### 07:00 - 14:00 | Highlighting the Tech Stack Debate

Here, the speaker references an example from the JavaScript community, focusing on the broader debate between using Rust or TypeScript for core tooling. He provides a real-world scenario in which Prisma, a popular ORM, recently decided to move away from Rust in favor of TypeScript. The rationale is that TypeScript fosters greater community contributions and easier debugging, rather than restricting participation to a specialized group of Rust developers.

Reflecting on this development, the speaker ties it back to Dash’s own challenges. Although Rust can yield performance gains, it may also deter broader engagement if developers lack Rust expertise. The speaker emphasizes that AJ’s proposals could bridge this gap, offering more accessible, maintainable code. By drawing parallels with Prisma’s journey, he illustrates how Dash, too, can benefit from prioritizing accessibility and open collaboration.

### 14:00 - 21:00 | Reassessing the Dash Platform Approach

During these minutes, the host explores how Dash Platform might cater more effectively to web developers. He notes that Dash Platform was originally pitched as a web-friendly solution, yet has become increasingly reliant on Rust-based systems like protocol buffers and other low-level integrations. This complexity creates friction for outside developers hoping to experiment with or extend Dash in languages they already know.

He showcases a real inquiry from a Flutter developer struggling to create client software due to limited documentation and bindings. The speaker contends that AJ’s approach—documenting serialization formats, providing clarity for multiple languages, and eventually creating a more approachable JavaScript SDK—could reduce such barriers. By appealing to a broader pool of developers, Dash can sustain a healthier ecosystem where outside contributors more easily build and maintain compatible tools.

### 21:00 - 28:00 | Understanding AJ’s Specific Proposals

Here, the host outlines the three separate proposals AJ submitted: two that focus on underlying Dash network layers and one that initiates a new web SDK for Dash Platform. He clarifies that only the third proposal directly involves the JavaScript SDK, while the first two address P2P enhancements and other infrastructure needs. Each is designed to improve developer experiences but tackles distinct areas in the Dash ecosystem.

By breaking down these separate goals, the speaker encourages masternode owners to weigh the proposals independently. Even those wary of investing in a web SDK might find value in AJ’s improvements to network protocol handling. The host emphasizes that AJ’s sometimes challenging personality shouldn’t overshadow his consistent track record of building popular, effective tools in other communities—tools that have attracted notable followings and multiple GitHub stars.

### 28:00 - 37:00 | Comparing GitHub Metrics and Developer Engagement

During this section, the host introduces GitHub star metrics to illustrate AJ’s track record in delivering widely used projects. For instance, AJ’s “Web Install” tool has garnered over 2,000 stars, surpassing the star count on Dash’s own repositories, which suggests he knows how to build and promote tools developers actually adopt. This underscores the potential advantage of bringing AJ’s proven talent into the Dash environment.

He then contrasts these metrics with the relatively low star counts on Dash Platform, highlighting a gap between the project’s promise and real-world developer uptake. Although GitHub stars are just one measure of popularity, they offer a glimpse into how easy or appealing a technology is for broader audiences. By aligning with a contributor who understands developer pain points and outreach, Dash can capitalize on the chance to drive higher community engagement.

### 37:00 - 45:00 | Budget Scenarios and Treasury Allocations

In this chapter, the speaker shifts focus to the practicalities of treasury management. A spreadsheet is used to illustrate various scenarios, showing how votes could be distributed among proposals from AJ, Dash Core Group, and others like Joel and Mikhail. He highlights that Dash’s price increase makes certain supplementary proposals more flexible, enabling potential room for multiple projects if masternode owners choose wisely.

He explains how the treasury can accommodate AJ’s proposals without necessarily pushing out important Dash Core Group funding. By outlining specific vote combinations, he shows how each approach impacts the remaining budget, signposting a path for masternode owners to fund AJ’s work while still supporting DCG’s baseline and some supplemental proposals. This multi-angle breakdown serves to demonstrate that backing AJ doesn’t automatically come at the expense of Dash’s core operations.

### 45:00 - 54:00 | Weighing the Technical Merits Over Personal Clashes

Here, the conversation reiterates that many prior objections to AJ’s proposals stemmed from personal disagreements rather than critiques of his code. The host acknowledges AJ’s interpersonal challenges but implores masternode owners to focus on the technical scope and outcome of each proposal. He reassures listeners that AJ’s day-to-day interactions can be managed, and that the community can still benefit from his expertise without needing direct, constant collaboration.

Furthermore, the host underscores how important it is for Dash to keep a steady pipeline of skilled developers who understand both the codebase and broader developer ecosystems. By reframing the discussion around impact and potential product appeal, the speaker hopes masternode owners will evaluate the proposals with an eye toward Dash’s long-term growth, rather than letting personality conflicts overshadow tangible progress.

### 54:00 - End | Conclusion and Call for Informed Voting

In the final minutes, the speaker summarizes key points: AJ’s three proposals carry distinct benefits, budget constraints are not as tight this month, and there are concrete ways to support both Dash Core Group and AJ’s initiatives. The host emphasizes the importance of an active developer community, suggesting that bridging Rust and JavaScript worlds could attract a wider base of contributors.

He wraps up by inviting listeners to review the proposals carefully on Dash Central or related forums, focusing on how each initiative supports web developers, boosts user-friendliness, and fosters an environment where Dash can flourish. By framing this vote as a decision about Dash’s future accessibility and appeal, he hopes voters will prioritize the ecosystem’s broader health, setting aside personal disputes in favor of solid technical gains and meaningful progress.

[00:00] all right hello everybody uh this is ryan i'm doing a solo show today uh
[00:00] for incubator weekly
[00:09] and uh also i know that uh we haven't been weekly every week uh the
[00:09] past little bit i've taken uh
[00:18] yeah taking a little break i guess uh for various reasons uh with the weekliness
[00:18] of incubator
[00:24] weekly but i am back today and i i want to go over today the
[00:24] proposal that i submitted
[00:31] um a little while ago called retain digital cash developer aj and i'll go ahead
[00:31] and share my screen
[00:39] uh right now so it's just going to be just going to be me today
[00:39] um
[00:51] and let's see zoom in on this until that sidebar goes away so this is
[00:51] the um
[00:58] this is the proposal that that i'm going to be covering today and i will
[00:58] try to i'm sharing my
[01:06] my desktop i'm sharing this window um and i'll mostly be looking at this window
[01:06] today but i will try to
[01:15] flip back and forth to see if there are any comments or questions in the
[01:15] live stream as well
[01:21] but it may take me a while to to look at those so um yeah
[01:21] hopefully uh hopefully i can get get to any
[01:30] questions that anybody has about this proposal uh so just going over the basics uh
[01:30] this is a just a one dash
[01:40] governance proposal essentially uh going over whether we should um retain aj as a uh
[01:40] active developer
[01:50] on in dash and specifically on a few projects that are already proposed they were
[01:50] proposed last month
[01:58] and they didn't uh get funding last month uh there's been a lot of discussion
[01:58] about that and i won't go
[02:04] over all the details uh but essentially there were some some personal issues that were
[02:04] got in the way of
[02:13] some of the technical merits of the proposals and i'm with this proposal i'm asking
[02:13] people to
[02:19] reconsider uh voting for those proposals uh because i see high value in them and
[02:19] um with the uh the price
[02:32] increase in dash it's possible now that um that we can accomplish or we meaning
[02:32] aj mostly for the for the
[02:41] most part here uh can accomplish what he proposed originally as two month proposals uh
[02:41] but within
[02:48] what within just one payout so prices roughly more than doubled um and they were
[02:48] two they were three
[02:57] two month proposals uh so each of those three two two month proposals can be
[02:57] accomplished with just one
[03:03] month even though the last month didn't pass if the pa if they pass this
[03:03] month he'll he'll be able to
[03:08] accomplish that scope of work um with just the one payment so that's that's the
[03:08] that's the the premise of
[03:16] this proposal um and
[03:20] here's the background i won't read the background uh this is this is basically it
[03:20] um i want to skip ahead to
[03:32] the purpose of the proposal and um and then i'm going to also share a
[03:32] quick video of a video a separate
[03:46] video that i came across um just a couple days ago uh from uh a
[03:46] youtuber named theo who's one of the the more
[03:57] prominent uh uh influencers in the javascript scene and uh as far as i know
[03:57] like probably in the top five
[04:05] um in terms of popularity if not top three in terms of popularity uh javascript
[04:05] programmers so very
[04:14] influential guy and he had a video that was um kind of relevant to this
[04:14] topic that i wanted to share
[04:24] and i think what i'll do is i'll go ahead and share that right now
[04:24] um this is uh unfortunately i i can't
[04:33] just play it from my browser so i'm gonna have to to share a separate
[04:33] i had some technical issues um and
[04:40] i'm going to share a separate screen of this that i'm adding to the stage
[04:40] right now the piece you're all
[04:45] here for the rust part point four enabling community extensions and collaboration prisma's architecture
[04:51] has historically limited community contributions as well as the places you can deploy it as
[04:51] well
[04:56] as the performance you can expect from it as well as the reliability there's a
[04:56] lot of things the
[05:00] architecture was causing problems with and they are very willing to re-architect i've seen this
[05:00] from
[05:06] them before but this is a bold move poor functionality such as query parsing validation
[05:06] execution has been
[05:13] managed by a rust engine which has been opaque to our typescript focus community expanding
[05:13] capabilities
[05:18] or fixing core issues has often fell solely onto their team we've addressed this by
[05:18] migrating prisma's
[05:25] core logic from rust to typescript and redesigning the orm to make customization and extension
[05:25] easier
[05:31] they finally did it they rewrote prisma at its core and threw out the rust
[05:31] engine whose days started back
[05:40] in graph cool finally they don't have performance numbers here yet they don't have the
[05:40] things you
[05:48] probably want to see and i'm sorry i can't tell you how much faster or
[05:48] slower the typescript engine is
[05:54] yet i'm sure this will come up in future videos once they are further along
[05:54] with this work but considering
[06:00] how much faster drizzle is in my experience than prisma i would not be surprised
[06:00] if this comes
[06:06] to the performance win this is something that ryan carniato says a lot ryan's the
[06:06] creator of solid js
[06:11] which is the fastest js framework and he says that benchmarks comparing a rewrite are
[06:11] often meaningless
[06:17] because the second time you do something you know so much more about it and
[06:17] you make many fewer
[06:23] mistakes even if you work in a slower language the result is going to be
[06:23] faster just because you
[06:30] are better at doing it and you know more so my suspicion is even though
[06:30] the language they picked
[06:35] is slower the thing that is slow in your database connection isn't the language you
[06:35] wrote it in it's
[06:43] the io and the management of these complex queries none of that is going to
[06:43] be bound on the power of a
[06:50] single cpu thread there's a lot of opportunity here for better architecture to result in
[06:50] huge performance
[06:57] the performance wins so i would be surprised if this ends up being slower i
[06:57] wouldn't be surprised
[07:01] at all if it ends up being meaningfully faster it'd be pretty cool if it
[07:01] ends up being comparable
[07:06] to drizzle and other faster orms i think they have a good chance of getting
[07:06] there so what does this
[07:12] mean for prisma it means the core will now be in typescript which is more
[07:12] accessible and open for
[07:18] typescript developers it means that extensibility will now be in the design where previously that
[07:23] weird way of exposing the api and the rust part was super opaque and they
[07:23] even had to work around it
[07:30] now everything is built with a focus on extensibility and plugin design which is huge
[07:30] and collaborative
[07:35] growth an approachable code base empowers the community to address issues and add capabilities
[07:39] directly yes i have looked at the prisma code base and immediately walked out because
[07:39] it was terrifying
[07:46] and i'm very excited to see how much more approachable this could be it's important
[07:46] to make sure the
[07:50] solutions you're building that are open source are accessible to the people who are using
[07:50] them in a way
[07:57] that they can understand the code make changes and push forward i'm concerned that this
[07:57] might end up
[08:02] being the same thing that happens with stuff like turbo pack rs pack etc because
[08:02] we as web devs
[08:10] want these tools because they're really fast for our web dev work but we as
[08:10] web devs won't contribute to
[08:15] them because they're in languages we don't understand there are very few devs that understand
[08:15] rust deeply
[08:20] enough and compilers deeply enough but also care about typescript and web dev enough to
[08:20] build something
[08:27] for web devs in rust most of the people who know compilers and rust really
[08:27] well spend more of their
[08:32] time shitting on typescript than they do compiling it i'm scared there will be a
[08:32] similar problem there
[08:38] where devs don't have interest in contributing to those tools because they're in the language
[08:38] that
[08:43] they're not using that's what happened with prisma it's really really key that they caught
[08:43] on to this and
[08:49] they're making this change and as awesome and exciting as it is i'm scared it
[08:49] might be the
[08:54] writing on the wall this is going to happen to the other rust rewrites of
[08:54] tools that we're so hyped
[08:59] about right now i this is one of those takes where i hope i am
[08:59] super wrong to be clear i'm not saying
[09:06] this because i want to say rust i'm saying this because i'm scared and i
[09:06] hope this isn't the case
[09:11] that said prisma is absolutely doing the right thing here and i am genuinely really
[09:11] excited about it
[09:17] one click aside on that point by the way namon who's the creator of style
[09:17] x one of the like
[09:21] industry experts in compiling your typescript because he found a way to get styles out
[09:21] of it
[09:26] as a css file lunatic called out that this point is so much more important
[09:26] than people realize
[09:31] that being the contribution aspect being able to contribute to these things is super super
[09:31] important
[09:36] in these rust rewrites are not considered enough of the risk there i have a
[09:36] video coming out soon
[09:42] probably not out yet keep an eye out for it the premise is why js
[09:42] rewrites in a faster languages
[09:48] might not make a lot of sense it's focused on the same core theme javascript
[09:48] is in my opinion a
[09:53] working class language is very forgiving of types also they're not a typescript fan which
[09:53] i know makes
[09:58] it hard to trust them it's easy to pick up instead supported by browsers there's
[09:58] a huge pool of people
[10:03] who are conversant with it for years we've had both library authors and consumers in
[10:03] the js ecosystem
[10:08] largely using js i think we take for granted what this enables mateo from the
[10:08] node teams quoted saying
[10:13] that most devs ignore the fact they have the skills to debug fix and modify
[10:13] their depths they are not
[10:17] maintained by unknown demigods but by fellow developers yes and that includes awesome things like
[10:17] patch
[10:23] package which to be clear i'm not saying you should use patch package a whole
[10:23] bunch but the fact that you
[10:28] can write a patch to one of your dependencies in your node modules and not
[10:28] have to get it merged or fork the
[10:35] depth you just make a few changes and now you're good to go that's huge
[10:35] it is such a useful thing
[10:43] you shouldn't use it a whole lot but at the very least they make it
[10:43] easy to go file an issue or a
[10:48] pull request making the change that you made here there aren't many languages and many
[10:48] ecosystems that
[10:54] make it this easy to change how your depths work and these are the things
[10:54] we throw away if we're just
[10:58] compiling binaries from rust anyways back to prisma i'm excited to move off of rust
[10:58] because for the first
[11:04] time it'll be possible to meaningfully contribute very exciting stuff
[11:28] Thank you.
[11:58] Now I'm back. Sorry about that. Thanks. Thanks, Michael Cluster, for telling me that my
[11:58] mic was muted. I was just saying, oh, I hope that wasn't the video that
[11:58] was muted. But just to make sure, I hope that video came through.
[12:14] And also, if anybody has a strong opinion about this proposal, my proposal here, including
[12:14] the three proposals that AJ has submitted, I would ask you to first please watch
[12:14] this video.
[12:32] Again, the background that I didn't give before sharing the video is basically Prisma is
[12:32] an ORM, which is Object Relational Mapper. You can think of it kind of like
[12:32] an SDK for databases.
[12:51] They had their engine, their core engine was written in Rust, and they've decided to
[12:51] go back from Rust to TypeScript. And the main thing, as my screen is sharing
[12:51] here, the main reason is to enable this community extension and collaboration part.
[13:10] So if you need to go back up the video later on or rewatch it,
[13:10] that's kind of what it's all about. It's this idea that JavaScript developers are JavaScript
[13:10] developers, they're not Rust developers.
[13:23] And if you want to have a project that enables contributions from other JavaScript developers,
[13:23] TypeScript developers, and the ability to like debug their code on their own and not
[13:23] feel like they have to just kind of bow down to the demigods of the
[13:23] Rust developers that have given this package, this binary that is kind of a black
[13:23] box to them, and they have to throw their hands up and say, I don't
[13:23] really understand this part of it.
[13:52] So I can't really help fix this problem myself or add to it, contribute to
[13:52] the project. That's kind of what this is about. So anyway, I'm moving on to
[13:52] back to back to the purpose of this proposal.
[14:12] Again, there's actually several parts of this proposal. It's asking people to vote on not
[14:12] only this proposal itself, but also to go back and reevaluate these proposals by AJ.
[14:35] And, you know, change votes if necessary, add your votes. This is this is the
[14:35] idea of the this is what we're committing to do. I wrote this a while
[14:35] ago, hoping that we would have some votes, we would have passing proposals earlier on,
[14:35] so that AJ could just start right away.
[15:01] It looks like it's going to go down to the wire as it always does.
[15:01] That's fine. So that was this first bullet point is that he'd start working on
[15:01] these proposals when they were in passing criteria.
[15:11] That's kind of a moot point at this point. But this I already talked about
[15:11] that he'll basically complete these proposals within one payment instead of two.
[15:21] And then this was just related to the background of the proposal that, you know,
[15:21] we need to move forward, focusing on technical aspects rather than personal disagreements.
[15:33] And then here for this vote interpretation, it looks like some of this text is
[15:33] getting cut off. So I'm going to zoom out and see if that fixes it.
[15:40] And yeah, the conclusions cut off as well.
[15:47] Hopefully that's big enough. I think it probably is. So for this particular proposal, if
[15:47] if I see people voting.
[15:57] Yes, for this proposal.
[16:01] Well, let me let me just do it in the order that it's written here.
[16:01] So the first thing I want people to do is, like I said, reconsider voting
[16:01] yes on these three proposals.
[16:11] If if if if if that happens, then that means if you want to vote
[16:11] yes, you like the technical merits of those proposals, regardless of AJ's personality.
[16:23] I know he's hard to work with. I know more than anybody that he's hard
[16:23] to work with because it's hard for me to work with him.
[16:29] Even being on his team, it doesn't matter to me. I look over those things.
[16:29] I look past those things.
[16:35] I look at the the technical merits. So that's what I'm asking you guys to
[16:35] do as well as look at the technical merits of this, these proposals and vote
[16:35] yes on his proposals.
[16:49] If you agree with those, I'm you won't have to work as closely with AJ
[16:49] as you may have in the past.
[16:57] I think we're we're going to probably keep a little bit further distance just because
[16:57] I know people have personality issues with him.
[17:04] Votes for this proposal, this meaning this digital cash retain, you know, this proposal that
[17:04] we're looking at.
[17:13] You vote yes on this, even if you don't if even if you don't support
[17:13] any of AJ's existing proposals, I'm still asking for you to vote yes on this
[17:13] proposal.
[17:24] If you want him to keep submitting other proposals, maybe maybe you like you want
[17:24] him to continue doing other things,
[17:33] but not necessarily these three things that which for which he has proposals up right
[17:33] now.
[17:41] That's fine. So vote yes on this proposal and vote, you know, however you voted,
[17:41] whether that's abstaining or no or whatever.
[17:49] So, and then if if I see people that are voting, if all the proposals
[17:49] end with a no vote.
[17:58] So yeah, like this is kind of it's going to be hard to for AJ
[17:58] to want to continue to work for Dash if if all of these proposals end
[17:58] with no votes.
[18:11] That kind of means that no, it's not it's not just those three proposals I
[18:11] don't like.
[18:15] I just don't like AJ and I don't want him working on the project anymore.
[18:18] I think that would be very sad.
[18:20] But I want to know that like if that if that's how people feel, please
[18:20] vote no for this proposal as well so that I can know I need to
[18:20] move on.
[18:30] Find other developers find a different path forward because I'm I'm committed to to serving
[18:30] dash.
[18:39] which I think that AJ contributes a ton of value and could in the in
[18:39] the future as well.
[18:45] But if that's what if that's not what the network wants, then please let me
[18:45] know.
[18:49] Yeah, I think I I think I covered this.
[19:01] Yeah, just comment comment on what what you'd like us to propose again.
[19:10] So backing up again, and zooming back out again, AJ and I both see huge
[19:10] potential in dash.
[19:18] And my target focus is web developers.
[19:24] I think that's what that's what dash platform was pitched as like the whole.
[19:31] The whole premise of dash platform was that instead of having developers need to learn
[19:31] solidity or rust learn solidity.
[19:44] One of these low level languages, they can they can just say is there any
[19:44] way to I guess I'll just be me here instead of having developers need to
[19:44] learn a very low level language to to take to make a decentralized application.
[20:01] You can store your data and build decentralized application using decentralized infrastructure using your own
[20:01] language.
[20:14] So that's kind of how it started.
[20:15] And right now it's I feel like the the focus has moved a little bit
[20:15] from from that target market of of traditional web developers to just rust developers.
[20:36] And I know that's a little bit of an extreme interpretation of it.
[20:40] I don't I'm not saying that's it exactly.
[20:42] But I'm saying we may have lost focus on the web developer use case and
[20:42] target market.
[20:49] So I'm going to take some time now to look at some of the comments,
[20:49] see if there's any questions that I missed.
[21:06] Let's see.
[21:07] And one time says you guys seem undaunted by the complexity of Evo and critical
[21:07] of DC and critical of DCG for bringing for for evil being complex complicated.
[21:19] Let's hope this can be done as easily as you're expecting.
[21:22] I don't expect this to be easy because I do know that that evolution evo
[21:22] dash platform has been architected and created in a way that is not not conducive
[21:22] for web developers in their native tools.
[21:46] So instead of like a Jason RPC, for example, it's it's using protocol buffers and
[21:46] things like this.
[21:56] So it's it's not using web technologies that that web developers developers would be able
[21:56] to easily interact with.
[22:05] And I know that the purpose of the SDK is to abstract away that those
[22:05] complications and to make it easier so that web developers can use the just an
[22:05] import of JavaScript SDK and then they'll be on their way.
[22:21] And we have one of those already.
[22:25] We have a JavaScript SDK.
[22:27] We tried it.
[22:28] We used it.
[22:29] And I think everybody agrees, including Dash Core Group, that that existing JavaScript SDK is
[22:29] not adequate.
[22:39] And so instead of fixing that, even DCG has decided, I think, to rearchitect that
[22:39] as well.
[22:49] So they're back to the design stages for building a JavaScript SDK, but it will
[22:49] be created in a similar way where you have wasm bindings, JavaScript bindings to a
[22:49] wasm core.
[23:05] And this is yeah, this this has pros and cons.
[23:11] One thing that I I haven't really scheduled for for this call today to talk
[23:11] about, but maybe I'll just mention it in passing today or right now, since it's
[23:11] on my mind.
[23:21] And there was somebody that was asking about I'm bringing up Discord right now so
[23:21] that I can I can refresh my memory on what.
[23:37] What we were what this guy was talking about, Joseph Marshall, see if I can
[23:37] copy a link to this copy message link.
[23:46] I can probably get this shared with with the window that I've already shared.
[23:55] This is Discord.
[23:58] I'm bringing I use the the normal native app for Discord.
[24:04] I continue in browser.
[24:06] It's making me it's making me register and log in.
[24:10] I think this I think this is probably worth it.
[24:12] So I'm going to go through this.
[24:14] I'm scanning a QR code to log in on my desktop here.
[24:18] Hopefully this will work.
[24:23] OK.
[24:24] Oops.
[24:25] Yes.
[24:26] Log in.
[24:27] OK.
[24:28] All right.
[24:30] All right.
[24:43] Now I got to share my screen again.
[24:47] There we go.
[24:48] And let me zoom in.
[25:00] That's not doing the zoom that I wanted it to, but that's OK.
[25:04] This developer.
[25:05] Can people read this?
[25:06] Is it?
[25:07] Let me zoom in a little bit more.
[25:09] This developer says, hi, all I'm working on a Flutter implementation of DAPI client.
[25:25] I had success with DAPI GRPC endpoints.
[25:28] Corn platform as well as stream now working with state transition.
[25:31] Does anyone have an example or some hints of how to create a state and
[25:31] sign a state transition?
[25:36] There's some info in the docs, but I haven't been able to get it working.
[25:39] Uh, hash engineering from dash core group says state transitions are quite challenging due to
[25:39] the serialization for signatures.
[25:45] Are you working on identity creation?
[25:47] And he goes on to say, you know, some things, uh, post some, some messages
[25:47] that he's getting.
[25:54] Uh, our good friend, uh, Mikael Shenmik says it's not simply adjacent.
[25:58] It's Jason.
[25:59] It's, uh, it's been code and coded rust serialization library.
[26:02] He says, I, okay.
[26:04] I missed that in the docs and clarifying that it's actually not in the docs.
[26:08] Um, but basically, um, uh, and I say here, I don't think it's DCG's intention
[26:08] to have people implementing clients in their own languages.
[26:18] Rather, the intent is to use bindings to their rust slash wasm SDK.
[26:23] Uh, and he says, okay.
[26:25] Are there flutter bindings?
[26:26] Uh, and I said, no.
[26:28] Um, is it on the roadmap?
[26:30] Um, I don't think it is.
[26:32] Uh, and I saw him typing after I saw this message,
[26:37] this message after I wrote this message and I was a bit, you know, short
[26:37] with him.
[26:42] And I just think that it's important to be honest about the trade-offs.
[26:47] So the trade-offs when, when we have one SDK, uh, is that people that want
[26:47] to interact with, um, dash platform, uh, in other languages, uh, they are not able
[26:47] to.
[27:03] So what we have currently is we have a rust SDK.
[27:08] And then we're the, the, the path forward is to create bindings, uh, in different
[27:08] languages.
[27:13] So, uh, if you have a flutter app, then you would need a flutter SDK
[27:13] to interact with dash platform.
[27:21] And similarly, if you have an iOS app, then you would need an SDK for
[27:21] iOS, uh, apps.
[27:30] And, uh, Kotlin for job, uh, Kotlin for, for Android and so forth.
[27:36] Uh, JavaScript for, for, for the browser and no JS.
[27:40] And, uh, if something, if one of these is not on the roadmap, um, somebody
[27:40] else has to make those bindings, which, you know, is possible, but it's very, uh,
[27:40] it's going to be difficult or we wait for DCG to, to make them.
[27:54] So this is just one more example.
[27:56] I, I, you know, I don't know who this is.
[27:58] Um, but it's just one example of, uh, the trade-offs that are involved with, uh,
[27:58] this approach.
[28:04] Um, now if, um, let's see, I'm going to go back to, uh, just me,
[28:04] I guess for now.
[28:15] Uh, let's see.
[28:17] Sorry.
[28:18] I'm a sole operator today.
[28:19] So it's a bit tricky for me to navigate everything here.
[28:22] Um, so let me go back to the comments.
[28:25] Um, I think if Evo had been built in a less complicated way, then it
[28:25] wouldn't be as good, but criticizing Evo for its complexity now just doesn't make sense,
[28:25] much sense to me.
[28:43] No, no.
[28:44] So, so I'm not, uh, I'm, you can say it's criticizing.
[28:48] I'm just saying there are trade-offs.
[28:50] Um, and trade-offs that, uh, don't necessarily have to be trade-offs.
[28:56] Um, so that's the whole idea with, uh, SDKs is, you know, you could have
[28:56] different, you can have different SDKs, uh, for different, uh, value scales and different use
[28:56] cases.
[29:07] Um, okay.
[29:12] So screen ship the discord and then open that image.
[29:16] Okay.
[29:17] Yeah.
[29:18] Oh, I know.
[29:19] Uh, I know.
[29:20] Uh, Michael.
[29:21] Uh, so I, I, I think I'm caught up on comments.
[29:25] So I'm back to, I'll go back to my, um, back to my screen share
[29:25] here and, uh, go back to, these are the three proposals, uh, that AJ has.
[29:40] Um, I think we've talked enough about these that I, I'm not going to go
[29:40] into each of these per se, but I do want to share them on the
[29:40] screen, uh, briefly.
[29:52] Um, the main idea with these pre three proposals is to make things easier for
[29:52] web developers, like I've said before.
[30:08] And the other thing that I wanted to note is that, uh, a very, very
[30:08] small part of, of these proposals is dealing with this JavaScript SDK part.
[30:26] So these, these two proposals have nothing to do with that.
[30:30] They, they do have, they, they are trying to help web developers, uh, by bringing.
[30:37] The different protocols that we use in dash to web, uh, environments.
[30:43] Um, and so in that respect there, you know, it's, it's all the same theme
[30:43] about helping web developers, but in terms of the JavaScript SDK, that's only this third
[30:43] proposal.
[30:53] So, uh, here's this first proposal.
[30:56] And then the second proposal is, uh, you know, has, is not related to the
[30:56] JavaScript SDK at all.
[31:06] Um, so I just want to make sure that people know that, that, you know,
[31:06] you can vote on these proposals separately.
[31:15] You, you don't have to vote on them as a block.
[31:17] Uh, it's only this third proposal that has anything to do with the web SDK.
[31:22] And, uh, once again, this is not, uh, proposing to make an entire web SDK
[31:22] at this point.
[31:30] It's the first step for that.
[31:32] So this hyphen is important.
[31:34] Develop web SDK hyphen platform ID with Explorer.
[31:39] So, um, this is not a whole web SDK.
[31:45] It's, it's the literally just the first part as somewhat of a discovery phase of
[31:45] how difficult it would be to, to do, to do a full SDK.
[31:56] We need to do the first few steps to, uh, to know how difficult the
[31:56] next steps will be.
[32:02] Um, and part of this will be documenting these serialization issues.
[32:09] Like the, what is actually, uh, what data is actually in these messages.
[32:17] So when, when we're talking about, uh, this guy back here, this Joseph Marshall guy,
[32:17] if, uh, he knew what actually was being serialized.
[32:27] It's not just a, it's not just a hex encoding of a Jason object, uh,
[32:27] which he assumed it was, it's actually been code.
[32:36] Uh, but that's not documented very well.
[32:39] And so if nothing else, um, AJ's work could help to document those messages.
[32:48] Um, so that other people in other languages could actually, um, make clients in their
[32:48] own language.
[32:56] that would have, that would be a benefit.
[32:59] Um, so AJ's work, uh, just to summarize AJ's work would actually help this guy
[32:59] in what he's trying to do.
[33:08] Um, so it's not actually just exclusively for web developers.
[33:13] Uh, I don't personally, uh, have any particular interest in Flutter.
[33:20] I don't like Flutter really, but you know, everybody's got their own preferences.
[33:25] And that's what this is all about.
[33:27] If this is an open protocol, then, then we should be giving, uh, enabling people
[33:27] to work with that in the way that they want to.
[33:34] And in the languages that they're comfortable with.
[33:36] Um, let me just, uh, go ahead and share this for, uh, documentation's sake.
[33:46] Um, the three proposals that we're talking about here are right here.
[33:51] Here you can see, uh, the, the P2P and ZMQ Explorer is relatively more popular,
[33:51] uh, up here.
[33:59] And then these two are about the same.
[34:01] Um, so I'd like all three of these proposals to pass.
[34:06] And I don't think that that's too high of a cost personally.
[34:11] Um, uh, as I was talking about before, um, AJ does have a lot of
[34:11] other ideas.
[34:17] Um, so this isn't, uh, this, this web SDK thing, which, you know, we've, we've
[34:17] talked a lot about and it's become kind of like a big thing, but this
[34:17] isn't, uh, this isn't really AJ's thing.
[34:33] Like he, he isn't personally driving this.
[34:36] It's actually me.
[34:37] That's personally driving the need for this.
[34:39] Um, he's just helping me out.
[34:43] Um, and, and, and by, by, uh, proposing this work.
[34:47] So, uh, like I said earlier, if, if you don't like, if this is too
[34:47] controversial for you, then, you know, you can vote to, uh, vote yes on this.
[34:59] Retain, uh, DCD AJ proposal.
[35:03] And that will give me a, me and him a signal that, Hey, it's like,
[35:03] it's just this issue.
[35:10] We just, we're going with DCG on this.
[35:12] And that's, you know, that's fine.
[35:14] Um, MNOs make the choice, right?
[35:17] That's what this DAO is all about.
[35:18] I'm trying to give people, uh, information to make an informed decision, but it's up
[35:18] to you guys.
[35:24] Uh, um, but like I, like I was saying, like, he's got a lot of
[35:24] other ideas, uh, to help dash.
[35:33] And so, uh, this is just a very small part of his ideas.
[35:38] Actually, most of the things that I have in mind are things that we've just
[35:38] discussed personally.
[35:42] Uh, but aren't, uh, he doesn't have, uh, draft proposals for, I just wanted to
[35:42] show that, that, you know, he's got some draft proposals for other things as well.
[35:51] Uh, let's see, I think we already looked at this.
[35:56] Uh, this is, this is just the art, uh, the article that, um, that Theo
[35:56] went over.
[36:03] This was part of his video that he was discussing.
[36:06] So I figured I'd just, uh, kind of look at this real quick.
[36:10] Um, he talks about how, you know, people are starting to become skeptical, skeptical of,
[36:10] of all these rewriting.
[36:20] Of all these rewrites in rust.
[36:22] And, uh, this is totally different guy.
[36:24] Like, I don't really know this Nolan, Nolan Lawson guy, but he's probably pretty popular
[36:24] if, if Theo's talking about him.
[36:31] Um, and he, he basically is talking about the, the, the idea that, you know,
[36:31] everybody's writing everything in rust and zig and go, uh, to, to gain performance wins.
[36:43] And there's no doubt about that, that sometimes you do gain performance wins.
[36:47] But the issue is sometimes there are trade-offs and unintended consequences of doing this.
[36:53] And one of those, one of the big ones that he emphasizes here is this
[36:53] idea of, of, of having developers be able to contribute and debug, uh, their, their
[36:53] applications in a way that they're comfortable with.
[37:08] Um, so I, I won't really go over this word for word, uh, but I'm
[37:08] just going to skim through this just to see if there's anything I wanted to
[37:08] highlight.
[37:18] Um, yeah, this, this breaks down if JavaScript library authors are using languages that are
[37:18] different.
[37:34] Um, and he talks about how it's easy to modify your, your dependencies.
[37:40] If you run into an issue.
[37:41] Um, yeah, I don't think, I don't think JavaScript is inherently slow.
[37:55] That's, that's probably true.
[37:56] Um, yeah, I, I also think as a community, we have not grappled with what
[37:56] the world would look like if we relegate JavaScript tooling to an elite priesthood of
[37:56] rug and zig developers.
[38:15] Uh, I can imagine the average JavaScript developer feeling completely hopeless every time there's, there's
[38:15] a bug in one of their build tools rather than empowering the next generation of
[38:15] web developers to achieve more.
[38:25] We might be training them for a career of learned helplessness.
[38:29] So that's more of like the JavaScript ecosystem issue, not necessarily a specific, uh, specific
[38:29] to, to what we're talking about here.
[38:38] But, um, I think this last paragraph is, is, is pretty relevant.
[38:47] Uh, I can't help, but feel like we're embarking down an unknown path with unintended
[38:47] consequences when there's another pass that's less fraught and could, could get us nearly the
[38:47] same results.
[38:56] And that's, that's, that's kind of relevant.
[38:59] That's, I would say that's, that's very relevant to the SDK issue here.
[39:02] Um, there are different ways to go about security and, um, getting what you need
[39:02] done and there are trade-offs.
[39:18] That's what engineering is all about is just, is dealing with trade-offs.
[39:21] It's not necessarily that one is better than the other.
[39:24] Um, so anyway, that's enough about that article.
[39:29] Uh, one other thing that I wanted to highlight is, um, this I've, I've opened
[39:29] up this plot.
[39:39] Uh, this is star history.com.
[39:42] I just wanted to give people an idea of like, you know, AJ, he has
[39:42] a different approach to things.
[39:52] AJ is very focused on building tools that, that make, that have utility and that
[39:52] help people get their job done.
[40:00] So what we're, what we're looking at here is, um, uh, one of the packages
[40:00] that, that, that AJ has out right now.
[40:11] So he has a package called web install.
[40:15] Some of you may have used it to download dash, uh, itself.
[40:20] Um, let's see.
[40:21] Uh, let's just go there real quick.
[40:24] Web install.
[40:26] Dev, I believe.
[40:29] Uh, so this is, this is the simple tool that he, he built and it,
[40:29] it, it, it's for developer tooling.
[40:34] It helps you install, um, packages from, you know, on a virtual machine, but package,
[40:34] uh, let's see.
[40:53] Yeah.
[40:54] Install developers tools with easy to remember URLs.
[40:57] So this is just an example of something that, that AJ has done.
[41:01] That is objectively valuable, right?
[41:05] So he's pretty, um, not only is he, uh, influential in the JavaScript circles and
[41:05] community.
[41:12] You know, he has a hosts, a podcast, a JavaScript podcast, but objectively his, his,
[41:12] the things that he builds are useful.
[41:20] And so that's what he's trying to bring into dash.
[41:23] This is the, uh, the, the tool that he's built has, uh, over 2000 stars.
[41:30] And just for comparison, this is all of dash.
[41:36] This is the dash pay dash, uh, the stars that the dash has received.
[41:41] And this is probably mostly people who have a vested interest in, um, in dash
[41:41] as investors.
[41:51] Uh, so 1500 stars on, on dashes, uh, core, uh, software, the, the dash D.
[42:02] Um, and you know, AJ's project.
[42:05] I know they're different.
[42:06] They're totally different projects.
[42:07] So it's tough to compare.
[42:08] Uh, I'm just bringing this up because, uh, you know, like him or hate him.
[42:13] AJ knows how to build tools that speak to people and that people find useful.
[42:19] This, this is like a meme stock here, uh, going up to the, up to
[42:19] the sky.
[42:24] Uh, and this by comparison is dash platform.
[42:28] Um, and you know, obviously, you know, we don't expect dash platform to, to have
[42:28] the
[42:34] kind of stars that something like, um, you know, uh, Webby might have because it's
[42:34] a different,
[42:44] uh, it's a different, uh, it's a different class of users.
[42:48] I'll just say, and you know, a lot of people that are in, uh, interested
[42:48] in, um, interested
[42:54] in cryptocurrencies, aren't necessarily going to get hub to star, uh, the, the packages that
[43:00] they, that they like.
[43:01] Right.
[43:02] But that is the whole purpose, uh, behind dash platform is to appeal to web
[43:02] developers, uh,
[43:08] or developers in general.
[43:09] So get hub is, is used by, um, all kinds of developers, not just web
[43:09] developers.
[43:15] And if platform is to be popular, then we would, we are trying to make
[43:15] it popular among developers.
[43:23] And you would expect to have some kind of, uh, popularity reflected in the GitHub
[43:23] star count.
[43:29] So as a side note, if you haven't already go star both, uh, both of
[43:29] the repositories for dash
[43:36] so that we can get these numbers up a bit.
[43:38] My point with this is just, just to say, AJ does know how to build
[43:38] tools that attract developers.
[43:44] And that the developers find extremely useful.
[43:47] This is proof of that.
[43:48] Um, now the last thing that I wanted to cover in this show, it's getting
[43:48] a little long already.
[43:53] Um, but, um, the last thing I wanted to cover is some scenarios about how
[43:53] you might, uh, vote this cycle.
[44:06] So this is just a spreadsheet that I have all the current proposals that we
[44:06] have up right now.
[44:15] And these are three columns showing the different, different scenarios that we could, that people
[44:15] can vote on to, uh, use the treasury, uh, in the, in the most maximal
[44:15] way.
[44:31] I'll say so like, it's no secret that MNOs do typically try to fit as
[44:31] many proposals in as, as they can.
[44:41] And I think that that's actually a good sign that shows that, uh, MNOs do
[44:41] value the work of developers, but there are always, you know, there are always trade-offs
[44:41] in, in what we fund as well.
[44:52] And so this month is no, no different in that respect.
[44:57] Um, so let's just go over these scenarios real quick.
[45:03] Actually, let me, let me check the comments real quick to, to see if, if
[45:03] anybody has, uh, questions.
[45:10] Let's see.
[45:14] Real quick here.
[45:15] Um, your comment I'm responding to is the more complex the system is to use,
[45:15] the more poorly that reflects on creators, I think.
[45:22] Uh, okay.
[45:23] So yeah, that that's, um, yeah, I do.
[45:28] Uh, this, this is a comment that doesn't really, people don't really have a lot
[45:28] of context to.
[45:34] So I guess I'll just, uh, since I covered this, I'll just bring up the
[45:34] context.
[45:39] Um, this is, so when people have, when people, well, let me back up here.
[45:51] Traditionally, develop, uh, software is often divided into a split system where you have a
[45:51] server and a, you have servers and clients.
[46:03] And, or, or in other words, you have services and clients consuming those services.
[46:10] Now it's one thing to have something that's a complex service to build, but that
[46:10] is very easy to use.
[46:17] Um, and it's another thing to have something that's, um, a complex system to use.
[46:24] And, uh, so the more complex the system is to use, the more poorly that
[46:24] works.
[46:32] The more poorly that reflects on the creators.
[46:34] Yes.
[46:35] I do stand by this.
[46:36] Um, this is, this is what I would, this is what I said, I think
[46:36] personally.
[46:41] Um, so yes, if, if it is, uh, in the end after, let's say after
[46:41] all is said and done, uh, and we have a JavaScript SDK.
[46:57] Um, if that is complex to use, if it's complicated to use that, then yes,
[46:57] it has, that, that has been a failure of the creators.
[47:07] So I, I guess, I don't know.
[47:09] I don't know.
[47:10] All I can say is I, I still believe I still, uh, stand by this
[47:10] statement.
[47:14] Uh, whether that's a criticism of DCG.
[47:16] Uh, I don't know that you, you make the call on that one.
[47:19] Um, I don't think Evo's complex design reflects poorly on.
[47:23] Let's see.
[47:24] I don't, I don't think Evo's, uh, complex design reflects poorly on its creators.
[47:29] Complexity and design is probably necessary for Evo to be good.
[47:32] Uh, yeah.
[47:33] Yeah.
[47:34] So some things are complex to create.
[47:36] There's no doubt about that.
[47:37] Nobody, nobody is, uh, disputing that.
[47:40] But all things that are complex to create, uh, should at least be simple to
[47:40] use.
[47:45] I think the best example of this is like Apple with an iPhone, for example,
[47:45] like nobody would
[47:50] know how to create an iPhone, obviously, but they go through, um, they go through
[47:50] a lot of
[47:55] pain to, to make it easy to use so that you don't even need an
[47:55] instruction manual.
[47:59] You know, back in the day when you'd have something that was complex, you, it
[47:59] would come with this
[48:04] huge construct, uh, instruction manual.
[48:06] Uh, that's not the case anymore.
[48:08] Like nobody's reading instruction manuals anymore.
[48:11] You have to have a product that is just simple to use without any instructions.
[48:16] Um, so anyway, I think I've covered that enough.
[48:21] Let's go back to this, uh, the spreadsheet here.
[48:24] So, uh, for anybody who doesn't already know, uh, the way that this, uh, this
[48:24] spreadsheet is
[48:34] organized, by the way, um, let me just, I don't know why that went unbolded,
[48:34] but, uh, for
[48:40] on the top here, we have the current proposals that are, uh, already up and
[48:40] that were, I guess
[48:49] this technically goes down here because I submitted this proposal this month.
[48:54] Um, let me just fix that real quick.
[48:59] Um, so these are submitted proposals that were submitted this month.
[49:06] So I, I submitted my, uh, retained DCG AJ proposal this month.
[49:11] Um, and, uh, we've got some, uh, three different proposals from Mikael or two different
[49:11] proposals
[49:21] from Joel.
[49:22] And then DCG has two supplemental proposals, uh, this quarter, this month.
[49:28] Uh, their, their other proposal, their main proposal is, is right here.
[49:33] And this is, I think the third month of a three month proposal.
[49:39] Um, so, um, so that's already there, but there are different ways to, uh, to
[49:39] vote these proposals.
[49:49] So for example, if, if you wanted to go with the, um, um, I want
[49:49] DCG to have as much funding
[49:56] as they can have potent, like as much potential funding as they can have, then
[49:56] you would obviously
[50:01] vote for their main proposal and you would vote for their two supplemental proposals.
[50:07] Now that would result in DCG, uh, having 72.5% of all of the funding this
[50:07] month.
[50:17] And, you know, if your goal is to maximize DCG's funding, that's a good way
[50:17] to do it.
[50:22] 74.5%.
[50:23] Uh, if on the other hand, uh, you don't necessarily want that.
[50:28] And let's just say that you, you want to support there.
[50:32] Oh, and by the way, this, this, this is the, the amount of dash that
[50:32] is left in each of these
[50:38] scenarios, uh, if each of these proposals passes.
[50:42] So the check mark means these are proposals that are assumed in the scenario to
[50:42] be passing.
[50:50] Um, and so if we uncheck this proposal, for example,
[50:57] this second supplementary proposal proposal from DCG asking for 175 dash, uncheck that.
[51:05] And now there are 175.2 dash remaining.
[51:09] And, uh, then there might be room for example, for, um, let's say, uh, AJ's
[51:09] digital cash dev is AJ.
[51:21] Uh, that would leave room for 175 here.
[51:25] So you could check these two, and then you would be back down to leaving
[51:25] 0.2 dash in the budget.
[51:31] So that's like scenario, uh, a, and I guess a, uh, a second version of
[51:31] a, uh, where, you know, in that first version, you, you vote for both of
[51:31] the supplemental proposals.
[51:49] And that would then knock out, um, these two proposals by AJ.
[51:57] And that that's, that's one way to go about that.
[51:59] Um, and I'll just, uh, yeah, I, I guess I'll, I'll back that up.
[52:03] So that that's one option.
[52:05] That's like the DCG maximalist, uh, option.
[52:07] Then there's this scenario B where let's say, uh, let's just fund DCG for their
[52:07] first supplemental, uh, which by the way is like more than they've had their supplementals
[52:07] in the past.
[52:27] Uh, even without considering, um, the increased price of dash.
[52:33] Um, but regardless, let's say, say you wanted to, to, to approve that.
[52:39] Um, to, to approve that and, um, that would then leave room for, um, this
[52:39] proposal, this proposal, um, and these two proposals, but, um, VJ's back ports assistance proposal
[52:39] would not fit for example.
[53:01] Um, and let's see, neither would, um, evolution marketing war chest number two, for example.
[53:11] Um, there is another option that I would just wanted to make people aware of
[53:11] if they do want to try to, um, give some supplemental funding to DCG.
[53:30] Uh, again, even though there's, uh, extra supplemental already built into their current proposal, which
[53:30] used to be 65, 60%, which is now 65%.
[53:42] You know, this, this proposal, this main proposal used to be 60%.
[53:46] Uh, last, uh, two months ago, they increased it to 65%.
[53:51] That I, I didn't hear much talk about it, but they did it.
[53:54] I thought it might've been a mistake at first, but it turns out it was
[53:54] intentional because funding was not, that's back when the price was still at like, uh,
[53:54] 20 something low twenties.
[54:05] So they decided it was necessary to do that.
[54:08] Um, that's their decision.
[54:11] Uh, and then, uh, also, um, uh, Kitty Whiskers Van Gogh has, uh, his other
[54:11] proposal.
[54:20] He's, he's working for dashboard group, but these proposals go to the same address.
[54:23] Um, so anyway, there, there's some supplemental built into this already.
[54:28] Uh, if you use 60% as your baseline.
[54:31] Uh, but even, even beyond that, if, if you did want to, um, to give
[54:31] DCG an extra supplemental with this, you can, you could have this scenario where you
[54:31] have DCG, uh, funding their second supplementary proposal, but not the first one.
[54:51] So this one's, this one's not checked.
[54:53] This one is checked.
[54:54] Uh, so they get 175, uh, supplemental.
[54:58] Um, and that would allow room for both of, uh, Joel's proposals, all of, uh,
[54:58] Mikhail Shenmik's proposals and all of AJ's proposals.
[55:12] Um, and, uh, Vijay's, uh, BCC backboard assistance proposal.
[55:19] So there is this scenario.
[55:22] This is, this is my ideal scenario.
[55:24] This, uh, scenario C where, um, DCG gets a supplemental and everything else can fit
[55:24] in the proposal.
[55:34] Uh, the budget, uh, that is basically asking like, this is, oh, the only thing
[55:34] that, that you would have to do is you would have to, uh, defund this,
[55:34] uh,
[55:47] uh, four dash proposal from AJ, which is currently not passing anyway.
[55:52] So that's what I wanted to highlight with this.
[55:55] I don't know if people have seen this option in their head because I don't
[55:55] think people have spreadsheets that they're using with stuff like this is something I had
[55:55] to create, uh, a while, a long time ago, uh, to try to, uh, orchestrate
[55:55] incubator proposals and things and make sure that we weren't stepping on too many toes,
[55:55] things like that.
[56:14] Uh, so anyway, um, yeah, this cycle week, you can have, if you're in support
[56:14] of AJ's work, uh, you want to show that you support, uh, Vijay's backporting assistance,
[56:14] which he's continued to do, even though he hasn't been funded for a long time
[56:14] for doing it.
[56:32] Um, you want to support, uh, McHale and Joel, all of those proposals.
[56:38] The only thing you have to do is, uh, vote for the second supplementary proposal
[56:38] by DCG.
[56:44] Um, and that lets everything fit.
[56:47] So I think that's enough about that.
[56:50] Um, let me go back and see if there are any other questions.
[56:53] Um, Michael Cluster says DCG have two supplemental, two supplemental proposals, WTF.
[57:05] Uh, yes.
[57:06] Uh, yes.
[57:07] And the description for those proposals, uh, you know, the reasoning behind that, that is
[57:07] the description in the proposals from, from DCG.
[57:17] So you can see what Sam's, uh, um, reasoning was for that.
[57:22] Uh, but like I said, uh, you can choose which one, which one or both
[57:22] or neither, uh, you want to fund.
[57:31] I think it's highly unlikely that neither supplemental proposal would pass, uh, even though there's
[57:31] supplement, supplemental, um, built into, uh, their existing, uh, main proposal here as well.
[57:46] And the price has over doubled.
[57:49] Uh, so there's definitely like, yeah, DCG is, uh, in surplus at the moment, assuming
[57:49] that the prices stay, uh, stay where they are right now.
[58:03] Now I understand the need to build a buffer.
[58:06] I, I, I really do personally.
[58:08] Um, so I don't, um, I don't, uh, fault DCG for wanting to build a
[58:08] buffer and, and require it.
[58:15] And, and requesting more than their, than their burn rate, uh, because incubator has had
[58:15] to do that in the past as well.
[58:22] And that's the only reason that, that we've survived as an organization, uh, is that
[58:22] we had buffers to, to help survive some of this downturn.
[58:32] And that's been way longer than I think anybody has was expecting.
[58:37] Um, yeah.
[58:38] Um, yeah.
[58:40] Um, yeah.
[58:41] And then, so, uh, one time says DCG's supplementals are usually supposed to be leftovers
[58:41] after whatever they expect will pass.
[58:48] But this month there's more uncertainty, I guess.
[58:51] And now this, this, that's what, that's what last month was.
[58:53] So last month, uh, DCG had some really tough decisions to make last month.
[58:59] Last month they had some tough decisions to make because they were in, uh, it's
[58:59] hard to believe, but just a month ago, less than a month ago.
[59:09] I'm just checking right now, less than a month ago, the price was $25 per
[59:09] dash.
[59:19] Um, about let's just say about half of what it is now.
[59:23] And when the proposals were submitting, it was submitted.
[59:26] It was about half.
[59:27] So yes, last month, um, they did have to break their general rule of, uh,
[59:27] not requesting funds that were already requested.
[59:38] That's what they used to do.
[59:40] They used to not even request supplementals that were competing with other proposals.
[59:45] They've gone against that.
[59:47] Uh, they went against that last month, um, because of fun, like legitimate funding constraints.
[59:53] So they would have to fire people if they didn't do that.
[59:56] And that's also why, uh, Kitty Whiskers, Van Gogh, KWVG, uh, submitted his own proposal.
[60:02] Um, but that is not the case this month.
[60:04] Uh, this month they could definitely have not submitted.
[60:07] Any supplemental proposals.
[60:10] Um, and they would have had more dash than their current outflow, their current burn
[60:10] rate, uh, this month, because the price is more than doubled.
[60:20] So this month is not a, a, um, is not a, a funding squeeze.
[60:26] This month is like, we want to, I'm assuming it's just, it's DCG saying, um,
[60:26] we want to build our reserves.
[60:35] Uh, so, uh, let's see.
[60:36] Uh, let's see.
[60:37] Uh, let's see.
[60:38] Uh, let's see.
[60:39] I will, I'll leave it there.
[60:41] I think.
[60:42] Let's see.
[60:43] I think I've, uh, yeah, I'm caught up on all the comments.
[60:46] Uh, remove this.
[60:47] I'll go back here.
[60:48] Um, so yeah, um, I'm asking for your support.
[60:57] Um, I'm asking for you to support AJ.
[61:00] I think he's valuable to the community.
[61:02] I don't see any reason, uh, that we should not fund him this month in
[61:02] terms of, um, funding budget constraints for DCG.
[61:16] That's not an issue this month.
[61:18] Um, so I appreciate the, uh, the support.
[61:22] I appreciate everybody who's made it this far into the video.
[61:25] I know it's been a long one.
[61:27] Uh, it's been over an hour.
[61:29] Um, I appreciate, uh, you guys for watching this and let me know if you
[61:29] have any questions.
[61:36] Uh, write them in the, uh, in the video description or on dash central.
[61:45] Uh, dash central, whatever discord, whatever you want.
[61:48] I'll be, uh, paying close attention for the next couple of days, especially as the
[61:48] vote's coming to a close in two days.
[61:56] Thanks everybody.
[61:57] Bye.
