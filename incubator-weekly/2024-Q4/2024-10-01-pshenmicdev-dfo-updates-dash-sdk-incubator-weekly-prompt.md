## Chapters

### 00:00 - 05:00 Introduction and Weekly Focus

In this opening segment, the hosts greet viewers and set the stage for the week’s main topics. They introduce Mikhail from the pshenmic.dev DFO, explaining that he’s there to provide updates on ongoing improvements and fixes within the Dash ecosystem. Immediately, they highlight the significance of ensuring smooth operations for masternodes and how that underpins a successful Dash platform.

They also note the importance of community feedback and voting for proposals, which has allowed certain projects to move forward. This brief overview underlines how collaboration between various teams keeps the Dash ecosystem robust. By laying out the priorities, from bug fixes in explorers to more in-depth code refinements, the conversation frames how each update can benefit everyday users and node operators alike.

### 05:00 - 10:00 Addressing Special Transactions

Here, the speakers explain the technicalities of special transactions, such as quorum-signing or masternode hard fork transactions, and how these were handled incorrectly—or not at all—by existing explorers. They discuss new functionality that now properly displays special transactions, shedding light on how these data structures differ from regular transactions.

They also touch on the complexity of integrating these features, including the need to handle the absence of standard inputs and outputs. This section illustrates how supporting special transactions, with all their unique fields, is necessary for an accurate and stable Dash explorer. The conversation underscores how this progress resolves a longstanding gap, ultimately making the Dash network more transparent.

### 10:00 - 15:00 Design Improvements and UI Fixes

Moving on, the discussion shifts to the platform explorer’s visual and functional upgrades. The team describes new UI features intended to present updated masternode and validator data more effectively, such as improved epoch details and user-friendly ways to view balances. They emphasize that intuitive design elements help users spot errors faster and maintain healthy node operations.

Moreover, they speak about the redesigned interface for special transaction details, ensuring it conveys all relevant metrics for quick troubleshooting. These improvements are not merely cosmetic; they simplify how complex data is displayed, especially for those unfamiliar with the granular workings of Dash’s consensus and governance layers. By focusing on usability, the project aspires to attract a broader range of participants into the Dash ecosystem.

### 15:00 - 20:00 Validator Page Overhaul

In this portion, the team reveals a new design concept for the validator page, aiming to centralize essential info about a node’s collateral, status, and potential earnings. They show how reworked UI components, including charts and status indicators, can help masternode owners assess their performance at a glance. The focus is on clarity: showing the latest proposed block, any past withdrawals, and overall health.

They also mention integrating additional data sources to capture metrics like real-time exchange rates. By presenting fees and reward data in monetary terms, the site appeals to stakeholders interested in precise financial tracking. This evolution in design highlights a desire to extend beyond technical data into more practical, easy-to-digest dashboards that reveal how each node contributes to the platform.

### 20:00 - 25:00 Node Health Checks and Future Features

During this segment, node status monitoring takes center stage. The idea is floated about checking ports and verifying node responsiveness through custom-built health checks. The speakers describe how these checks could provide near-instant feedback if a node experiences downtime or networking issues, giving operators better control over their infrastructure.

They also reference third-party tools that do similar monitoring but note the importance of building independent solutions within the Dash ecosystem. The conversation underscores a broader goal: to create dependable, standardized practices that anyone running a node can rely on. These improvements promise to free operators from guesswork and encourage a more professional, hands-on approach to node management.

### 25:00 - 30:00 Handling Complexities in Transaction Details

Here, the conversation dives deeper into transaction detail pages, outlining plans to expand the displayed information for different transaction types. The speakers note that certain special transaction data, like quorum references, can be crucial to advanced users, and the platform explorer must reflect all these nuances.

They also discuss a more granular breakdown of identity creation or document updates. By enriching these views with details like funding addresses and public key types, the explorer allows users to confirm transaction integrity more effectively. This expanded transaction data coverage broadens the tool’s appeal, empowering both experienced developers and curious newcomers to engage with Dash in a more informed way.

### 30:00 - 35:00 Document-Based Operations and Missing SDK Support

The team delves into how document-based operations—creating, updating, transferring, or purchasing documents—are crucial to building more complex use cases on Dash Platform. They emphasize that certain transaction types, notably document purchase or transfer, aren’t fully supported by the JavaScript SDK.

The absence of these essential methods creates bottlenecks for anyone hoping to implement business logic around document ownership. This gap fuels a call for more robust library features, either by upgrading the current JS SDK or by creating alternative solutions. It highlights the growth potential of Dash once these missing pieces are in place, allowing for a broader ecosystem of decentralized applications.

### 35:00 - 40:00 Challenges with the JavaScript SDK

In this timeframe, attention shifts to the hurdles developers face when using the JS SDK. They mention synchronization issues involving an SPV client that must download significant network data, leading to timeouts and incomplete transactions. Developers also struggle with incomplete documentation, leaving them to guess how certain operations should be executed.

Acknowledging these frustrations, the speakers stress that filling these SDK gaps is critical for Dash Platform adoption. They point to the necessity of a well-maintained and comprehensive codebase, one that’s welcoming not just to core contributors but to a global pool of developers. The goal is to reduce friction and ensure that new dapps can be created with minimal overhead or confusion.

### 40:00 - 45:00 Future SDK Direction and Platform Team Collaboration

The conversation turns to prospective improvements, including modular builds and curated libraries that could simplify the process of writing data to the platform. While they note some promising pull requests in progress, they also highlight that finalizing these enhancements might require both community-driven code and direct involvement from the core Dash team.

Much of the development is on hold due to missing documentation or unimplemented functionalities, underlining the shared responsibility to push these features across the finish line. Ultimately, they believe well-orchestrated collaboration will lead to a stable, reliable SDK that serves as the backbone for a thriving developer ecosystem.

### 45:00 - 50:00 Building Out Real Use Cases

In this part, they showcase real progress in designing data contracts to manage tasks and payments for distributed teams. By using Dash credits as the currency, they demonstrate how a developer can create a deliverable, request payment, and receive credits upon completion—all tracked on the blockchain via document-based transactions.

They show how these concepts mirror standard project-management workflows, but with an added layer of transparency. This example underscores how everyday administrative processes can shift onto Dash Platform, offering immediate, verified settlements and robust version control. It’s a tangible demonstration of the potential for wide-scale adoption once the technical barriers are cleared.

### 50:00 - 55:00 Tying Data Contracts to Developer Compensation

The discussion continues around the specific fields in these new data contracts. From project identification to task details, the aim is to ensure each step in a task’s lifecycle is verifiable and easily referenced on-chain. The presenters underscore how using Dash credits for payouts aligns well with the platform’s decentralized ethos.

They also talk about best practices, like focusing on native Dash amounts rather than pegging to fiat, to simplify calculations. This highlights that new contract-based workflows can be adapted to suit various organizational structures, whether large or small. By streamlining development tasks into a trustless environment, the platform fosters a more unified and efficient collaboration model.

### 55:00 - 58:41 Final Thoughts and Next Steps

Wrapping up, the speakers revisit their main achievements and remaining tasks. They stress the importance of thorough documentation, workable SDKs, and continuous feedback from masternode owners, developers, and the wider community. Though challenges remain—such as limited testnet availability and missing transaction types—they maintain an optimistic outlook.

The conversation concludes with a reminder that these incremental improvements pave the way for a vibrant, developer-friendly ecosystem. The emphasis is on moving forward collectively, whether through new proposals, open-source contributions, or direct collaboration with the Dash core team. Their closing words encourage everyone to stay involved and keep exploring what’s possible on Dash Platform.

[00:00] welcome everybody uh to another week of incubator weekly uh this time we are not
[00:00] uh we've got
[00:09] mikhail on but not as uh representative of an incubator uh dao but uh or
[00:09] dfo but rather
[00:17] hang on i forgot to pause the other side there all right so uh mikhail
[00:17] welcome to the show again
[00:26] uh this time as um shen mc.dev dfo uh so you've got some updates for
[00:26] us today and uh we're going to
[00:36] talk a little bit about the the javascript sdk as well and some issues that
[00:36] that you know you've been
[00:42] seeing with that um as you've been been using it so uh yeah welcome um
[00:42] yeah hey guys so i have quite
[00:52] updates really like uh we've done really a lot of stuff though uh there was
[00:52] some budget shorts and we
[01:01] finally got our uh proposal approved and yeah i think thank you everybody who uh
[01:01] who was
[01:09] like who was supporting it and voting so uh yeah so basically there were a
[01:09] lot of updates uh inside the
[01:21] platform explorer uh we fixed uh the dash inside uh there was some stuff with
[01:21] the masternote hard fork uh
[01:31] implementation it was just missing um so we had to make some few more changes
[01:31] uh and release
[01:40] all of the versions so yeah it's now should work as expected and we also
[01:40] added let me quickly show you
[01:49] uh can you um please turn on the screen share oh just yep uh so
[01:49] yeah um
[02:00] uh we added a little uh a little ui fix so basically um there are
[02:00] special transactions in the inside that um
[02:16] that's just not implemented in the dash core ui uh in the inside ui sorry
[02:16] and we did so previously
[02:25] it was if we open it from the from the production yeah we will see
[02:25] that it is uh usually just blank and
[02:37] showing uh no transactions let me let me quickly search so this is you're looking
[02:37] at testnet right now
[02:45] yeah yeah yeah yeah you see unbrass addresses and stuff like that uh so those
[02:45] are special transactions
[02:53] uh there are few of them like uh the first one is most known is
[02:53] quorum sign uh is quorum signing uh
[03:00] transactions that happens uh uh i don't know some regularly uh in the blockchain and
[03:00] um during the last b22 or 21 update
[03:12] uh there was uh there was uh like they introduced uh a new special transaction
[03:12] that called uh masternode hard fork
[03:21] and it wasn't even created inside ui and it was basically breaking the the dashboard
[03:21] node uh not the
[03:28] dashboard that uh the main team is working on but uh the thing inside the
[03:28] inside
[03:35] well inside is breaking so anyway version of node yeah yeah so yeah the new
[03:35] special transaction was
[03:42] introduced uh and on the explorer it's shown like just like like a blank yeah
[03:42] so we fixed uh the things
[03:51] and we made this little small change so it will show which which exactly uh
[03:51] the special project the
[03:58] transaction was just like initiated and we actually think thing would like we actually thought
[03:58] that we
[04:07] can actually expand it with some additional information like for example if it's a quorum
[04:07] uh transaction
[04:13] then we can show which quorum uh signated and you know which index and stuff
[04:13] like that uh maybe later we can
[04:21] extend it but we just made it like it's as simple as possible for right
[04:21] now okay can you tell us a little
[04:28] bit more about these types of transactions i i know it says masternode hard fork
[04:28] um are these all dip
[04:35] two type transactions a special type of the dinner i think i think that's something
[04:35] i think that's something
[04:43] that was uh introduced together with the platform stuff i don't know i'm not sure
[04:43] how exactly it's uh
[04:49] it's working but i guess that there are some sort of uh some person percentage
[04:49] of the masternode should
[04:58] be like should accept the fork uh before it happens you know like you know
[04:58] okay uh i don't know uh like
[05:05] the the details but can you uh click see i guess that that's just a
[05:05] screenshot that you're showing
[05:12] right there but um can you go back into so do you know what block
[05:12] this is from or can you copy
[05:21] and paste that into uh i'm not sure that this is the screenshot from the
[05:21] developer so one thing i was
[05:26] curious about if you could go to your last tab if you could go to
[05:26] the last tab on your page there
[05:32] uh the the very yeah that one on the all the way to the right
[05:32] uh you mean like this transaction yeah that
[05:41] that that works right there so can you expand click on the plus button and
[05:41] expand that uh to see no
[05:50] it's not expanding it doesn't expand okay it's actually it's actually returning uh an empty
[05:50] array
[05:55] of addresses and that makes sense because there are no no really like there are
[05:55] no inputs and no outputs to
[06:02] this yeah yeah yeah the data the data is is it in an op return
[06:02] field or
[06:08] that there are no data to show like there are there are there are different
[06:08] there are special
[06:14] data that we can show they can we can show which quorum signed this transaction
[06:14] stuff like that there
[06:19] are some hashes and there are some additional data but it's not just regular transactions
[06:19] there are no
[06:26] inputs and outputs so we gotta work on this okay just make or just make
[06:26] a new explorer yeah yeah so the the
[06:34] the the important thing though is that the the browser the ui the api are
[06:34] not crashing anymore
[06:40] so we can we can always yeah yeah yeah we managed we managed to to
[06:40] create a workflow like uh our developer
[06:49] like he just got into this all all of this stuff like how it's working
[06:49] so he can make changes uh so we can
[06:57] sort out problems or make even some additional things if we have to so yeah
[06:57] it's pretty great
[07:05] okay um now one just last thing before we leave this topic if you could
[07:05] copy the the transaction um
[07:13] different from the url or that that works too and then open a new tab
[07:13] in block chair
[07:21] block chair dot com and then go to that transaction and i just i'm just
[07:21] curious to see because i know
[07:28] that they have dip two transactions implemented oh oh this is test net right so
[07:28] they might not have test net
[07:35] um i'm just curious if if there's anything that that is working on block chair
[07:35] as well because they are
[07:45] a partner of ours that has explicitly tried to support dip two transactions
[07:59] right now you're you're just looking for one of those special transactions that were yeah
[07:59] going empty data
[08:10] and if if we don't find one that's okay okay we can okay we will
[08:10] we will check it later yeah but uh but
[08:16] i guess they they're not showing it yes okay you could just copy that transaction
[08:16] id from the url and
[08:22] put it in the block chairs um oh no this is testing this is testing
[08:22] okay so uh moving on then what what
[08:30] other things have you been working on and yeah actually the most the most of
[08:30] the work was uh around
[08:37] platform explorer but it's not just like making the platform store requires you uh searching
[08:37] like uh
[08:46] get like deep into the platform protocol and there are a lot of things missing
[08:46] always and there are like
[08:54] so we we stopped we were sampling in a lot of issues and we actually
[08:54] helped the main team uh we made
[09:03] serial platform pull requests so there was uh a missing parameter in the epoch uh
[09:03] so let me start uh with
[09:14] the backend part i'll just show you quickly uh what we have on platform explorer
[09:14] now and what we plan to do
[09:22] uh i will show uh i will show the back and front end and and
[09:22] and designs yeah so uh
[09:31] one second um yeah so
[09:38] when the platform release happened uh we rushed to do some very important things like
[09:38] uh previously we had the
[09:51] balances uh not really matching uh what network has because it was uh calculating it
[09:51] from the its own
[09:57] database so we we moved strictly like we we moved uh straight to the to
[09:57] the dap interface to the grpc
[10:06] interface to to read the data about things like uh identities balances and uh other
[10:06] things so it's very important
[10:17] that's going to change because now we have uh accurate data for mainnet and people
[10:17] actually can
[10:23] look uh the platform balances um like when we when we go into the validators
[10:23] all right we can we can
[10:32] see an identity and we can see the credits so it's actually what the network
[10:32] uh actually the latest state
[10:39] of the balance uh previously it was like not kind of accurate uh yeah we
[10:39] also removed case sensitivity
[10:48] for hash uh someone from the community notized that when you're searching hash in the
[10:48] uppercase or
[10:55] lowercase so sometimes it's not working no not working right uh yeah the epoch uh
[10:55] we really
[11:07] worked on this on this one particularly this one um so the first one the
[11:07] third thing that we
[11:15] was running into is uh the epoch index in the js dash sdk in the
[11:15] dapi client it was missing the
[11:23] parameter uh so we couldn't just get the the latest the latest epic however it
[11:23] was in the dapi but there
[11:30] were issues so uh when the platform was released uh there there were no like
[11:30] info about the epoch and uh
[11:39] we couldn't get it uh like as fast as possible because there were missing uh
[11:39] supporting the js sdk
[11:46] uh support from platform but just the js sdk itself was not able to get
[11:46] yeah can you back a little bit for for
[11:55] folks and explain what an epoch is and uh why it's important on on the
[11:55] platform chain yeah so the epoch
[12:06] is like the um uh how to explain like the epoch is where transactions are
[12:06] happening and the validators uh
[12:16] like uh signing all of the transactions all of the blocks i mean sorry uh
[12:16] when they when the fees are
[12:25] collected into some pool and then after epoch changes uh all all the rewards gets
[12:25] distributed between between
[12:32] between master nodes and yeah um it's a time frame that um exactly you're seeing
[12:32] right here on on your
[12:42] explorer that there are two days left in this time frame and it looks like
[12:42] uh are they from my understanding
[12:48] from my uh memory i think it's is it nine days long or what how
[12:48] is it yes or is it 40 epochs per year
[12:58] uh it's 9.125 uh so it's yeah it's 365 days per year divided by 40
[12:58] 9.125 and my understanding is
[13:10] instead of being defined by blocks it's actually defined literally by clock time and um
[13:10] the clock time
[13:20] is a little bit like in proof of work systems we don't go by clock
[13:20] time and there's some subtle reasons
[13:29] why but my understanding of how platform nodes work is that um each platform node
[13:29] will will um uh broadcast
[13:40] the time stamp that its server is using and if somebody tries to say you
[13:40] know monkey with the actual
[13:47] time stamp and say yeah it's actually a week before now or it's a week
[13:47] later than now then the other
[13:52] nodes on the network who we're assuming the majority of those are honest they'll say
[13:52] no that's not actually
[13:59] the real time and then they'll just discard that data is that is that how
[13:59] you're is that your
[14:04] understanding uh so that that's how we can define these literally by clock time um
[14:04] yeah it's kind of
[14:12] complicated how the apex works but yeah it's like just in details it's kind of
[14:12] uh i think it's it's
[14:21] based on the it's based on the block that is starting then then we have
[14:21] like some time frame and yeah so
[14:29] basically this this uh this this field is like approximate and uh when when the
[14:29] epoch change should
[14:38] happen it's not exactly the time but it's just approximate i don't know if anyone
[14:38] just have the
[14:45] exact time of epoch change so yeah uh anyway yeah we work through this uh
[14:45] we work through this
[15:00] um we also so there was a lot of things ah we also did uh
[15:00] total collected fees uh i think we can see
[15:15] that we can see that here yeah so there is a new front and front
[15:15] end improvements on this page actually
[15:23] uh uh as well so where did the fees collected uh now it shows uh
[15:23] the information collected
[15:30] fees by the epoch so okay that's the fees in epoch 3. yeah yeah should
[15:30] be so that that number will
[15:40] presumably restart when in two days that will be down to back down to zero
[15:40] yeah yeah yeah
[15:47] um yeah what about design uh we really really worked through through design really a
[15:47] lot we we worked
[15:57] really great um so we managed to really improve the specific validator page this is
[15:57] basically the best
[16:08] page that we have i think right now um let me show you a figment
[16:08] so uh it's not yet live or is it uh
[16:21] isn't it i i don't know but if it is then it would probably be
[16:21] better to look at the actual website
[16:26] um it's not coded yet it's a mock-up uh it's still a mock-up this is
[16:26] just the design so far then yeah yeah
[16:35] let me just close it i can't okay so anyway uh yeah uh yeah we
[16:35] worked through this page because it's uh
[16:44] very very useful page on the platforms right now uh and a lot of people
[16:44] using it right now we have
[16:52] pretty simple just just like the tables uh for things like validators and identities so
[16:52] it's not
[17:02] not really informative uh very simple and and it's actually the same for for the
[17:02] each uh uh on the
[17:10] platform entities for the identity for data contracts we have pretty simple pages that doesn't
[17:10] show really
[17:17] much data so we started from the validators then we want to hop on the
[17:17] identities and then finish with the data
[17:24] contents uh since this is the most used page right now we started with it
[17:24] and yeah this is what we have
[17:33] so far uh when we open it uh we can see the protex hash we
[17:33] can see that the balance right right away
[17:39] where it's uh when it was created and the identity address uh you can click
[17:39] on it and you will be redirected
[17:47] uh to this identity so now is that a balance is that a balance that
[17:47] is due to them or that's the balance
[17:55] that actually they have in credits in other words um it's current balance it's current
[17:55] balance uh which
[18:03] identity has current balance which identity has um so that would not include um let's
[18:03] say this validator
[18:11] uh it's actually a good question i think we can we can also at the
[18:11] balance uh like ah we have uh reverts
[18:20] with this epic uh which shows uh which should show uh the amount of uh
[18:20] credits you will earn uh from
[18:27] from the proposed blocks during this epic so yeah we can we can move it
[18:27] uh into this into this part
[18:35] also like as well yeah and i noticed that you also have uh what presumably
[18:35] a us dollar amount uh
[18:42] um yeah that's yeah we already we already we already implemented uh the rate api
[18:42] so the front-end uh
[18:54] guy the alexei already working on it so we should see it very very soon
[18:54] everywhere on on the website
[19:01] will be accredited there will be a dash equivalent and also the usd one okay
[19:01] we also acquired from the two
[19:10] sources uh from the uh i don't remember first but second is kucoin so in
[19:10] case uh one of the of the host is
[19:21] is down or is returning some here we will get the information from the second
[19:21] one so just fall back
[19:28] yeah so uh what's also important here i wanted to show the ports uh that
[19:28] master node has
[19:37] and an indicator which will show the status so in case you just set up
[19:37] your node or uh for example if
[19:46] you have some issues with your dip it will be shown on the website so
[19:46] i plan to add we plan to add a special
[19:55] api which will call the tcp uh request to this node and it will check
[19:55] uh like if the node is doing well and
[20:04] all responses are as expected so it will be some kind of health check uh
[20:04] for your node now i i i know that
[20:14] mnowatch.org has implemented uh certain such a feature on their site are you using are
[20:14] you depending
[20:23] on their site or are you doing it dependently are you doing it the same
[20:23] way that they do it how does it
[20:29] compare uh yeah we will implement it on it on our site uh and we
[20:29] will have support of ipv6 okay
[20:38] um so yeah uh the status yeah this is like uh some more extended info
[20:38] about the validator we can see
[20:52] the status right now it can be either waiting for quorum or active you know
[20:52] uh so it will previously we had
[21:00] some you know we had some some issues with it with showing this information not
[21:00] issues like it was uh
[21:08] not showing correctly active non-active so we we managed to get away from it and
[21:08] make like active
[21:15] and waiting for forum we will see an epic right now and that that is
[21:15] happening uh when the next step should
[21:22] start should start should start in uh the rewards that validator earn this uh this
[21:22] epic and also all
[21:31] the time like uh the total collected fees uh from from from the first from
[21:31] the you know from the creating
[21:40] of creation of the node we can also see the last proposed block and uh
[21:40] withdrawals counts and last
[21:48] withdrawal i think this is very very cool information very very useful information because i
[21:48] think if you
[21:55] open the validator you want to see if your last proposal when you propose the
[21:55] last block like you want
[22:02] to see uh if it happened recently or not and you can also you should
[22:02] also like you want to also see the
[22:11] withdrawals if for example someone hack you and withdraw all of your posts uh you
[22:11] will see it on this page
[22:19] you know um yeah uh we also added some core stuff so you can always
[22:19] check what the collateral of this
[22:28] address uh who is the owner voting address uh you can uh copy a public
[22:28] key in case you wanna do some
[22:37] checks i don't know more for for developers i think this maybe might be useful
[22:37] yeah it's all buttons which
[22:47] is uh in the these boxes means it is a button so you can just
[22:47] uh so you will be redirected to
[22:57] it will act as links uh what about the chart uh we rethink or if
[22:57] we thought about that and
[23:07] we made a custom calendar that you can always uh switch because we had like
[23:07] uh prefix it uh we had
[23:15] prefix it right now we we still have uh time frames and you you cannot
[23:15] cannot like choose some custom
[23:27] you know periods and the this one is also is also not informative as we
[23:27] as it could be uh so we decided
[23:36] to to make a calendar yeah there are no design for design for this calendar
[23:36] yet but we will do it soon
[23:42] so we expect it so when you click uh the chart will be replaced with
[23:42] the calendar so you can just
[23:49] click uh on the time frame that you want and then it will will be
[23:49] replaced with the with the chart again
[23:57] so yeah i think that it will be like uh very easy to use so
[23:57] i think it will be a cool thing to have
[24:06] uh so yeah we we can add some several charts we don't know what what's
[24:06] exactly useful to put here
[24:16] but the thought that we can also show the people of reverend certain chart i
[24:16] don't know if it's much in
[24:22] the proposed blocks i think this shouldn't uh but we we can then see how
[24:22] much you know rivers they they
[24:31] earn over the time and you know so also the cool thing and here's the
[24:31] the tabs with some maybe some
[24:41] some info that might be also useful like transactions with the rails proposed blocks we
[24:41] can also add something
[24:48] here as well yeah uh that's all about the validator uh do you have something
[24:48] to add ryan
[24:58] here okay so that's the that's the validator page one question that comes to mind
[24:58] right now is so i know
[25:05] that the one of the major use cases for the site right now is is
[25:05] the actual validator node operators
[25:11] they're they're looking at it to make sure that these things are that their node
[25:11] is properly working
[25:17] and and things like that and that's a that's a good uh thing to start
[25:17] with but for anybody else or
[25:22] even those node operators who want a feature that you don't have currently on your
[25:22] roadmap
[25:29] how can they request a feature so i'll give you an example of one if
[25:29] you go to the the live site one
[25:37] thing that i've wanted to see uh on the main page i think is instead
[25:37] of a bunch of uh hexadecimal uh
[25:46] numbers for the contracts i'd rather see the name of the contract um so that's
[25:46] that's just a simple
[25:54] example of a feature that i as a community member might want how do we
[25:54] go about telling you about
[26:00] that i'm assuming you'd want people to put in some kind of a github issue
[26:00] or something can you show us
[26:07] briefly how the best well yeah obviously the best the best place would be the
[26:07] issues but but you can also
[26:17] just uh post a message in discord or telegram i will read it and we
[26:17] will think about that so any way that
[26:25] that you can like any any way that you want like uh yeah we have
[26:25] issues here we can you can anybody can
[26:33] put uh a new issue and tell us uh what we what what needs to
[26:33] be what needs to be implemented or some
[26:43] feature request so i will i will review it yeah we're just in the discord
[26:43] uh like in the general
[26:49] or i don't know and then they'll make an issue for it yeah so if
[26:49] people don't have a github account
[26:56] but that's not just for developers uh it is for anybody who wants to uh
[26:56] you know give feedback to
[27:03] any kind of software probably a good idea to get a github account just so
[27:03] you can say uh join a
[27:08] discussion or say i'd like this feature um okay so whatever um also yeah there
[27:08] is there is one more
[27:16] thing that uh that we are working right now it's uh the next thing that
[27:16] we that we change in the design
[27:25] will be a transactions a specific transactions page so we worked on this a little
[27:25] bit so i think we made
[27:33] like a half of it or or so um uh yeah um the page is
[27:33] very important because because when you're answered
[27:48] ad section huh interesting so yeah this is very important page because uh when you
[27:48] open up uh the
[27:56] specific transaction uh you should be able to see all all of the data that
[27:56] that that you that that is
[28:04] there and uh let's see for example a document special transaction right now we don't
[28:04] really have
[28:11] a lot of data we have just some links we have like hash height and
[28:11] stuff like that gas used uh it's good
[28:19] that we the that they even have the status because yeah so it's it's not
[28:19] really descriptive uh yeah so
[28:27] we plan to change it and detail it as much as we can uh we
[28:27] worked a lot through this we had like
[28:36] several calls uh with our designer he's doing really really great job for us like
[28:44] and he really will to do more so uh yeah uh so basically we divided
[28:44] it into two into two main parts
[28:57] the first one is like the header of the transaction which is uh some kind
[28:57] uh similar i think it's the
[29:05] same between all of the transaction types there are like six transaction types and one
[29:05] of the transaction
[29:11] types also have six transitions which is documents batch uh so we have like 12
[29:11] different interfaces that
[29:18] we should draw uh so this one is header and this this this one is
[29:18] just the details uh in the identity
[29:29] create we can see uh the asset log proof uh we can see the funding
[29:29] address of this identity so when you're
[29:39] creating your uh creating your identity from the l1 wallet right uh there is a
[29:39] asset asset unlock i think
[29:45] it's it's called asset unlock someone uh said about this recently um yeah so yeah
[29:45] you can see the
[29:55] funding address you can always just click on it and you will be redirected to
[29:55] the explorer and you can check
[30:03] stuff about it about about about that too uh we can see a public bytes
[30:03] oh sorry it's uh i think it's
[30:11] it's not the right it's not the the latest i think it's not the latest
[30:11] thing about uh document creation
[30:19] so it looks like your designer is hard at work yeah yeah he he he
[30:19] do a lot of things so it looks like
[30:45] it looks like your designer hard at work yeah yeah he he he do a
[30:45] lot really a lot and he asked what
[30:52] very what is very small i mean you know what i mean so uh no
[30:52] i can't find it um
[31:08] should be there
[31:15] i am a little curious while you're looking um i am a little curious about
[31:15] the the advertisement
[31:20] section do you have plans for that is that going to be some kind of
[31:25] yeah yeah yeah yeah we just uh we just thought what to put into this
[31:25] like uh there was a lot of empty
[31:34] space in this page and uh and yeah we didn't know what to put so
[31:34] we just put in the advertisement
[31:43] uh probably good idea so some maybe some external developers some third party uh dap
[31:43] applications there's
[31:53] dap applications uh can can make some advertisement on the platform explorer so it's a
[31:53] good thing to have
[31:59] uh i can't find it so yeah anyway anyway that's okay uh so there will
[31:59] be everything so there will be
[32:08] details of the public keys uh it will show you the public keys the type
[32:08] of the public keys it will show
[32:13] you also the contract bounds uh ah here it is here it is i think
[32:13] this one is is the most up to date so
[32:23] yeah i wanted to show that uh it also show you the keys in the
[32:23] contract bounds of the keys because it's
[32:29] a very important feature uh so basically we can have some public keys only locked
[32:29] to the certain data
[32:37] contracts and even the certain uh data contract document types what the what means is
[32:37] that we can
[32:45] have a public key that uh have only access to to one specific data contract
[32:45] or one specific data
[32:51] contract and document type for example uh we can have a data contract of three
[32:51] different storages but
[32:58] it only can have like it can do any other transactions too you can make
[32:58] withdrawals and transfers you know
[33:06] so it will i'll be shown on the platform explorer um yeah uh we also
[33:06] started the documents batch
[33:16] uh this one uh oh this one uh i think is identified yeah we also
[33:16] added the fee multiplier uh which show you
[33:27] like uh amount of fee that you pay uh over the standard yeah so let's
[33:27] get uh let's get
[33:44] uh uh uh yeah let's get to the documents batch uh documents batch yeah it
[33:44] shows you the owner of the
[33:55] documents batch of this particular and owner of the transactions i don't know why there
[33:55] is multiple
[34:01] owners so uh in the like in the protocol you you can i can see
[34:01] the owner of the state transitions i can
[34:11] owner of the documents batch i don't know why it's duplicated but things like this
[34:11] so we just duplicated
[34:17] it uh here too um in code in case of document create we can see
[34:17] a document type uh a link to the data
[34:27] contract and identifier which was just created the revision uh identity notes uh i don't
[34:27] know how this will be
[34:36] used but i think this is uh some kind of info that developer will be
[34:36] using will be will be checking
[34:43] uh on document replace which is updated of the document we can see the timestamps
[34:43] uh of when the
[34:53] document was last updated transferred stuff like that and we obviously can see the data
[34:53] of this json like
[35:03] which will be replaced or put insert into the platform we can see a delete
[35:03] and delete
[35:09] document transition
[35:13] uh and the most the most interesting i think it's the document transfer
[35:19] uh which is not yet implemented to the was in dpp uh which is turned
[35:19] out we didn't know about that but
[35:27] we will talk about this uh a little bit later and the document purchase and
[35:27] document update price
[35:33] so document percentage means that you can buy a document uh from the from the
[35:33] identity and
[35:42] this identity will receive the money that was set uh via the document update price
[35:42] method and transition and
[35:51] and yeah that's basically a buy sell like operation you know and this is a
[35:51] very interesting one and i
[36:00] think this it will be very very very used in the network um so we
[36:00] basically will be i think the first one
[36:08] one who will be using it for our dfo yeah it shows you um the
[36:08] buyer identify uh identity the seller identity
[36:17] um yeah and the price that that was document was sold for
[36:26] yeah um so i know there are you have some ideas and i have some
[36:26] ideas about this document purchase idea
[36:34] but can you give us and the viewers just a little bit of an idea
[36:34] of what does it mean to buy a document
[36:41] and why could that be useful because um at a very base level buying a
[36:41] document as far as i understand
[36:51] basically just means you're buying the rights to ownership of that data so that you
[36:51] can
[36:58] you can be the one that changes the data for example but there are other
[36:58] um there are other use cases
[37:04] such as the one that you mentioned last time you were on which is about
[37:04] a month ago i think um where
[37:11] you would be buying the deliverable of a developer organization as a way to compensate
[37:11] them for the
[37:20] work that they've done do you want to talk about that a little bit more
[37:20] uh yeah let's uh have a quick
[37:25] chat about that so yeah the the operation allow you to to sell a document
[37:25] which means that uh the balance
[37:35] will be transferred uh to the seller and the buyer will receive a document i
[37:35] think it was uh come in
[37:43] first place with the nft support as snft support so that basically for people who
[37:43] who can like they can
[37:51] know some sort of nfts that was uh is meant to be like in the
[37:51] first place but i think people will use
[37:59] it for the different things for example we have we plan to use it to
[37:59] to pay developers for tasks uh they
[38:08] will be able to submit a claim document uh which uh which uh contains a
[38:08] link uh to their done work
[38:18] and also the amount of credits that they they want for and me as a
[38:18] as a uh a different identity i will
[38:29] buy out uh their documents uh for the amount that they they put so and
[38:29] all of that yeah that that means
[38:38] that they will receive yeah that that means that they will receive the credits and
[38:38] me uh i will receive
[38:44] a claims uh from them as uh as a return in return yeah so yeah
[38:44] it's pretty cool feature i think
[38:56] uh uh yeah now you mentioned that this is not a feature that is supported
[38:56] by the dash
[39:03] sdk yeah uh let me get a quick through the front end parts i would
[39:03] also show you what we was working on
[39:11] the on the on the front end so uh yeah there are there were not
[39:11] too much like pull requests but there were
[39:24] like uh pretty big itself uh first first we we reworked uh a little bit
[39:24] uh the status we introduced the
[39:37] epoch uh there was some data missing uh it was shown previously as not available
[39:37] on the validators i think
[39:46] would all right here we also reworked on the validators uh page so uh there
[39:46] were a lot of internal work
[39:55] basically uh basically so to to make to to make it so uh it also
[39:55] reflected also reflected on the other pages
[40:05] um yeah we updated the network selector i believe yeah there were work uh when
[40:05] we the platform was
[40:15] released and we also had to update it uh
[40:21] what else we also improved the mobile menu uh the mobile menu wasn't uh wasn't
[40:21] great at all so when
[40:30] you're looking at the mobile section or when you're viewing it on the mobile sorry
[40:30] uh you can see now
[40:40] a menu which works works good and yeah we didn't have it uh
[40:47] yeah right now we are working on the specific validator page which uh was already
[40:47] done uh
[40:53] in the design so alexei already working on it so we should see some working
[40:53] example i think
[41:01] um i think next week do you have plans um on that previous page do
[41:01] you have plans on the fees
[41:10] collected i think that would be nice to show a dollar amount there as well
[41:10] yeah yeah yeah we will update
[41:17] it uh i think that's that's pretty good idea um yeah or not maybe not
[41:17] just dollars but any uh if you
[41:27] are australian dollars or canadian dollars or euros is there going to be a way
[41:27] to select
[41:32] your base currency your fiat currency of choice uh we can add we can add
[41:32] it um yeah
[41:40] okay feel free to create an issue yeah we will we will have everything question
[41:40] what you need like
[41:48] i mean i'm fine with dollars personally but i know this is not yeah i
[41:48] mean i mean yeah yeah it's more
[41:53] like for people international uh yeah so so you wanted to also talk about the
[41:53] dash js sdk a little
[42:05] bit yeah we're yeah so we had uh we had quite hard work on it
[42:05] like uh working with it and like it's hard
[42:17] it's hard to use and it's not convenient to use it's uh it's missing features
[42:17] for example we found
[42:25] out that uh the document transfer document purchase document set price is missing from the
[42:25] wasn't dbp
[42:31] implementation can you uh before you jump into that can you open a page uh
[42:31] to show people what we're
[42:38] talking about uh like maybe either the npm site or uh the source code or
[42:38] what exactly are you talking
[42:46] about because i know there there are at least two uh sdk talking about the
[42:46] javascript sdk uh yeah
[42:56] i'm talking about all these the keys basically uh except the rest uh because only
[42:56] rest will work
[43:04] through the top for itself yeah and yeah basically i can show you uh it's
[43:04] missing it's not there we can
[43:13] have a document batch transaction but we can all we can see only only three
[43:13] only three transitions
[43:18] and we miss transitions uh we miss transitions for for document update price we miss
[43:18] transitions from
[43:28] for document purchase and document transfer uh so that means that nobody can execute the
[43:28] transactions uh
[43:37] in the network uh at least from the js sdk and i believe from the
[43:37] mobile too um in case they also
[43:45] use awesome dbp to make platform transactions so that's the thing that uh we need
[43:45] to have because
[43:53] it's really missing um maybe maybe i will be able to add those missing by
[43:53] things but it will take time
[44:01] uh we'll have to look at it uh on the next uh on the on
[44:01] this week or next week yeah we also thought about
[44:10] how to how to make those transactions without js sdkbs it also has different issues
[44:10] for example one of
[44:17] one of the things that bothering uh everybody is that it is a spv client
[44:17] implementation and it requires you to
[44:26] download a lot of data from the network before you can actually use it uh
[44:26] even if you want to just uh
[44:32] getting your address or get some experts some private keys you still need to sync
[44:32] it all the way up
[44:40] in default conditions so yeah you can use valid lip separately from the dash sdk
[44:40] but
[44:49] nobody really use nobody really does that so uh everybody just uses dash sdk and
[44:49] uh people retrying
[44:57] and retrying and that is not working good uh it always fail request like with
[44:57] some uh there are
[45:04] like this is pv error or stuff like that i believe that it's tapir returning
[45:04] some some bad data so that
[45:14] dash sdk cannot clearly decode it and uh yeah it's it's not like it's not
[45:14] it's not the best experience
[45:23] that developers can have with it and yeah it's really blocking and stopping yeah there
[45:23] was some chatter uh
[45:31] even just this morning about like okay how now the platform is is literally released
[45:31] uh platform is live on
[45:39] mainnet um so where are the developers and the issue is well if people most
[45:39] developers uh most of most
[45:51] people building applications are wanting to use javascript that is the language of the web
[45:55] and most of our infrastructure is written in rust and so the the binding between
[45:55] the two is supposed to be
[46:03] uh uh uh which both the browser the browser supports but there are some issues
[46:03] with that and so that's
[46:11] that's the issue that we're that you're bringing up is that we we can't really
[46:11] have javascript developers
[46:18] i don't actually i don't think that rest is any good with it right now
[46:18] in in the any much better state
[46:25] even rust yes even even rest because yeah we we thought about how can we
[46:25] solve it without the jsdk
[46:32] the first thing that came up to us we just uh get rust and get
[46:32] some examples uh but but there are no
[46:39] examples uh in the in the platform there are no documentation about how how to
[46:39] make your transactions
[46:45] uh yes there are no examples there is just single this is an example uh
[46:45] of the document query uh or data
[47:11] contract query so it this query just doesn't really involve any signing you know uh
[47:11] any yeah it's not
[47:19] a right transaction it's a reaction so the easiest type of transaction for 11 hours
[47:19] are you saying to do
[47:26] that with rust or the tui i mean i mean the both as the case
[47:26] is not in that condition that uh allows
[47:35] developers to develop root just quickly uh do uh this uh you know so even
[47:35] with rust js dash is the key
[47:43] it's not it's not it's not yet there and i hope that yeah people should
[47:43] well sorry platform should
[47:52] platform team uh should be working on it uh after just right after the drill
[47:52] so i hope it will be
[48:00] uh improved as soon as possible because it's really bothering developers uh it's blocking their
[48:00] work and
[48:07] also the testnet is always down recently there was an issue with the certificates um
[48:07] i needed to i needed
[48:16] some help from the platform team but they didn't couldn't help me because the testament
[48:16] is down you know
[48:23] and uh yeah uh yeah so so there are there are some things that are
[48:23] very crucial to end developers who
[48:36] aren't and 99.999 percent of developers aren't going to want to dig into the infrastructural
[48:36] side of
[48:45] things to try to figure it out themselves so we really do need these sdks
[48:45] the software development kits
[48:51] the the libraries that that your standard developer just put imports into their code and
[48:51] and can use
[48:59] easily that's not we're not there um but the good note here is ours yeah
[48:59] but the good note here is that
[49:07] we we actually work on this so anyway we will make all these things um
[49:07] either our site or dcg will
[49:16] implement it so i think uh over the time this is this is pretty much
[49:16] solvable so uh so yeah we just
[49:24] uh so uh yeah yeah you're you're working on it we're working on it as
[49:24] well i mean
[49:32] we we put in some time to try to do an identity create transaction using
[49:32] um using yeah the raw bin code that
[49:43] that s that um rust code uses so we we've looked into this as well
[49:43] um it is it's not easy to to do but
[49:53] somebody's got to do it and i think that um yeah taking a couple different
[49:53] approaches to this uh is is
[50:02] helpful i know we can't just completely wait on dcg to to finish it because
[50:02] they have other priorities
[50:11] um but it would be but we also do need help from dcg to give
[50:11] us the information that we need or just
[50:18] to make it easier um to build your own tooling around uh the raw uh
[50:18] grpc calls um so do you know
[50:29] what i i saw some some poll requests and some issues related to
[50:37] um something about making all transactions with serday support uh serialize deserialize uh the rust
[50:45] part of it do you know anything about like and i know that i i
[50:45] saw them uh mentioning that they have
[50:53] some changes in mind to how they're going to be building the sdks do you
[50:53] do you know anything about
[50:58] that that you can help us out with because i know you uh what what
[50:58] pull requests uh sorry from the
[51:03] platform on the repo yeah platform um i mean i would have to to look
[51:03] it up again but i just remember
[51:14] seeing some some talk about like we're changing the way that we're doing the build
[51:14] process for the for
[51:20] the uh sdks and you know stay tuned kind of thing so anything specifically about
[51:20] that no i don't know
[51:30] about about this yeah yeah so the awesome dvp bundle is too big right now
[51:30] really it's like really big yeah
[51:41] yeah well it's not even the size the size is an issue but it's also
[51:41] just knowing how what what are
[51:48] the raw bites that go across the network to that uh we need anyway we'll
[51:48] we'll talk about this off
[51:54] yeah let's go because it's probably a little bit too in the weeds for the
[51:54] audience here but um
[52:00] yeah so anything else that you wanted to say about um just your overall experience
[52:00] working with platform
[52:07] uh the the things that you're working on i know that most of your work
[52:07] is going into the platform
[52:12] explorer is there anything else beyond or outside of the platform explorer that you're working
[52:12] on
[52:17] yeah i want to show you the updates the data contract that uh that we
[52:17] made uh if you will
[52:25] yeah so i just wrote the pull request for data contract and this is
[52:33] somewhat uh somewhat uh sample data contract that we will be using in our dfo
[52:33] uh to pay out people for
[52:42] tasks okay uh yeah uh as i said in the previous shows uh we will
[52:42] have a data contract uh which will
[52:55] will be served as uh as a storage for all of the projects all of
[52:55] the tasks and all of the people's claims
[53:03] for their work uh yeah so it will be fully transparent this is essentially the
[53:03] same
[53:11] process that incubator has that we use our trello page and our google doc to
[53:11] make
[53:20] tasks and claim tasks and be paid for tasks and you're bringing this this the
[53:20] platform talked about
[53:27] this a little bit in the last time so so how it works uh so
[53:27] we have we have three uh different
[53:33] storages we have three document types and the first one is this project which will
[53:33] uh hold a set of uh
[53:41] documents uh about our projects we have a tasks which will uh have a fields
[53:41] for like title descriptions
[53:49] so real and stuff like that and uh uh and we also have the claim
[53:49] document that developer will use
[53:59] uh to to sell to sell to sell to sell their their deliver to me
[53:59] so that they can receive the credits
[54:09] yeah uh so how it works we feel we feel from our site i will
[54:09] fill the first i will submit the data
[54:18] contract then i will fill the projects i will fill uh all of the projects
[54:18] that that we are working on
[54:25] uh i will fill the first tasks uh and then people will be able to
[54:25] submit a claim document which uh which
[54:35] has a task id uh it also has amount uh of credits and about usd
[54:35] but it will be it's not exactly the
[54:45] amount that is happening on the protocol level but it's just an informative amount to
[54:45] keep track of
[54:52] and the deliverable is the link like the to the github pull request or i
[54:52] don't know any kind of
[54:59] document that is served as uh approved work so when the people when the developer
[54:59] uh creates a claim
[55:08] document it fills all of the fields and then i will be able to review
[55:08] it uh then like developer sets
[55:17] i will initiate a document person purchase uh method which will buy out the claim
[55:17] from the developer
[55:36] account identity and he will receive the amount of credits uh that that he put
[55:36] the price price for
[55:46] yeah this is obviously this is your dfo now you're uh you're the leader there
[55:52] personally my only feedback would be to completely dereference the uh usd amount and and
[55:52] have it
[56:00] completely dash native um there are issues i've run into issues with being having discrepancies
[56:00] between
[56:09] the credit the credit amount and the the price amount um so that that's how
[56:09] incubators always worked as we
[56:15] we do our accounting and all of our uh everything is is just in dash
[56:15] terms um and then there are periods
[56:24] well i just i just thought that it will be like uh a good note
[56:24] to have just in case you know uh how many
[56:33] the amount in usd yeah i mean you can always derive that information from the
[56:33] dates right so um when
[56:41] somebody puts in a claim uh they there's a date on that and you can
[56:41] look up with any resource the amount
[56:47] that we can put rate for example instead of usd yeah anyway um that's that's
[56:47] your decision to make um
[56:54] yeah yeah just we will see we will see yeah uh yeah cool is this
[56:54] uh is this live on the network
[57:02] uh yet or is it just not yet uh we we won't deploy it until
[57:02] we have a way to to claim those documents
[57:12] yeah yeah withdrawals and are needed so that's coming out also yeah yeah and the
[57:12] withdrawals
[57:18] not even withdrawals we oh right yeah missing the way to execute those transactions so
[57:18] yeah i think
[57:25] that will take like one or two weeks at least yeah yep well this is
[57:25] good though i'm glad that you're
[57:32] you're jumping ahead with this because you know like i've said in the past we
[57:32] can't have any nobody
[57:37] else is going to feel comfortable building anything useful or meaningful on platform until we
[57:37] have
[57:43] internal dependencies on it uh so that people can see that we're actually using it
[57:43] in real life so
[57:49] i'll continue to look forward look at this and and i'll be doing something similar
[57:49] i'll probably use
[57:57] your baseline uh to to start a contract for my myself for the incubator itself
[57:57] um so we'll both be kind of
[58:07] doing this same thing in parallel and doing our own little versions of it but
[58:07] i think a lot of it will
[58:14] overlap so it's good that you're you're uh leading the way on that uh anything
[58:14] else to say we we're
[58:22] almost an hour now so um if not then we will um close it out
[58:22] but any last words um i don't know
[58:31] nothing comes to my head sorry okay no worries well thank you uh thank you
[58:31] for joining us uh on
[58:41] this week's uh incubator we'll see everybody next week see you around
