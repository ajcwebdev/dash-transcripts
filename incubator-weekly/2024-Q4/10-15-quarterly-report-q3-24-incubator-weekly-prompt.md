## Chapters

### 00:00 - 05:00 Introduction and Panel Overview

In this opening segment, the host welcomes everyone to the Q3 2024 Dash Incubator report, setting the tone for a comprehensive review of ongoing and future activities. The panelists—long-time strategists and fresh faces—take turns introducing themselves and explaining their roles. Each person brings a distinct background, spanning coding, strategic oversight, and direct contributions to Dash-based tools.

They also provide a brief glimpse of what to expect in the conversation ahead. From summarizing Q3 outcomes to forecasting Q4’s strategic pivots, the group outlines their collective mission. This early look prepares listeners for the more detailed discussions on proposals, budgeting, and the rationale behind shifting the Incubator’s format toward a single overarching proposal.

### 05:00 - 10:00 Incubator’s Single-Proposal Strategy

Here, the focus shifts to the Incubator’s move to a more consolidated proposal model. The host details how the organization aims to simplify its administrative load by submitting one core proposal each quarter, rather than multiple smaller ones. This structural change is intended to foster a more dynamic environment in which contributors can step forward with independent proposals for specific projects.

The panel explains that such a transition keeps the Incubator agile while encouraging a broader group of innovators to join. By removing administrative barriers, they hope more teams and individuals will venture into the Dash ecosystem. This approach underscores their belief in diversity of thought and the value of decentralized problem-solving.

### 10:00 - 15:00 Web App Demo for Submitting Proposals

During this segment, a demonstration takes center stage as the host showcases an early prototype for a new web application designed to streamline proposal submissions. Instead of needing to run a full node or juggle wallet commands, users would simply enter details on a user-friendly interface. This tool also hints at potential crowdfunding features, allowing others to help cover proposal fees if needed.

The panel discusses how this lowers barriers for new developers and outside parties who might want to build on Dash but find the current process too technical. By automating various components—like generating essential commands and verifying addresses—the app aspires to bring a more diverse set of proposals into the Dash network.

### 15:00 - 20:00 Mikhail’s Team Expansion and Platform Explorer

Here, Mikhail outlines how his team has grown to include five developers and a UX designer, significantly boosting productivity. He highlights that the majority of their efforts center on the Dash Platform Explorer, a key component for navigating and understanding Dash Platform data. With regular backend and frontend updates, the Explorer remains cutting-edge and responsive to developer needs.

The new UX designer’s impact is immediately apparent, resulting in sleek user interfaces and better user journeys. Mikhail underscores the importance of real-time data, improved design, and comprehensive documentation so that anyone—whether an experienced coder or a complete newcomer—can effectively interact with Dash Platform. This expansion in personnel and vision sets the stage for more rapid and user-friendly development.

### 20:00 - 25:00 Validator Page Enhancements

Mikhail dives into recent upgrades aimed at giving master node operators and validators deeper insights into their node performance. The redesigned validator page not only looks modern but also tracks metrics like block proposals, reward history, and withdrawal counts. With collapsible sections and better navigation, users can pinpoint problems quickly, such as connectivity issues in the P2P layer.

In addition to performance metrics, the new design includes clearer visuals for potential earnings and last proposed blocks. By making these data points easily accessible, Mikhail’s team addresses a frequent request in the Dash community for more transparent analytics. These enhancements reflect a broader push to simplify complex data, empowering both new and veteran operators.

### 25:00 - 30:00 Additional Platform Explorer Features

Moving on, the conversation explores new functionalities under development for the Platform Explorer. These include expanded transaction details such as asset lock, asset unlock, and token transfer processes. Mikhail’s team plans on a holistic approach, linking each transaction to relevant contract data so users can understand how it all intertwines.

Moreover, they discuss how non-fungible tokens could be displayed, with data like purchase price and current ownership status. By systematically incorporating these features, the Explorer aims to be the ultimate reference point for everything happening on Dash Platform. Ultimately, this granularity paves the way for new applications and integrations that rely on clear, accessible on-chain information.

### 30:00 - 35:00 Faucet Project and Infrastructure

In this section, Mikhail shares details about an experimental faucet project designed to distribute testnet Dash in a more engaging manner. By linking social media accounts or performing small tasks, participants can claim coins in ways that boost visibility for Dash. This pilot project also serves as a proving ground for new developers on Mikhail’s team.

They further mention how infrastructure changes have been made to support this and other community-driven utilities. The overarching goal is to make the developer experience smoother, whether it’s hosting a faucet, adding a new feature to the Explorer, or refining internal processes. Each initiative is framed as a piece of a larger puzzle that makes Dash more accessible.

### 35:00 - 40:00 VJ’s BTC Backports

Attention then turns to VJ, a long-time contributor focused on backporting crucial Bitcoin updates into Dash Core. He explains how these patches help keep Dash’s codebase more aligned with Bitcoin’s advancements, ensuring better performance and security. VJ also touches on the vital role that outside review, including that by Dash Core Group, plays in merging these contributions.

Although the Incubator has historically supported his work, future plans involve VJ submitting his own stand-alone proposal for funding. This move aligns with the group’s overall push for more independent, specialized proposals. By highlighting VJ’s consistent track record, the panel demonstrates that the new funding model can bolster contributors who deliver consistent, valuable results.

### 40:00 - 45:00 Crowdnode Integration and Wallet UI

Shifting gears, the host and Jojo Byte discuss the current status of ongoing efforts to enhance wallet functionality. One key project involves integrating Crowdnode, which has been on hold due to uncertain circumstances but is still a priority for improved user engagement. Jojo also explains the broader refactoring of the Wallet UI for better maintainability and extended feature sets.

Much of this segment focuses on how the wallet may evolve beyond mere transaction handling. Features like staking or micropayment services could be added, making it a central hub for various Dash-based services. The group underscores that quality and usability remain top concerns to ensure a smooth onboarding experience.

### 45:00 - 50:00 Rationale for Independent Proposals

During this interval, the conversation circles back to the overarching transition: encouraging every contributor to become their own proposal owner. The panel argues that this shift fosters a more direct relationship between project teams and masternode operators. It also gives innovators more flexibility to define their budgets and goals.

They emphasize that, while the Incubator will still provide guidance and possibly early-stage funding, its main function will become a stepping stone rather than a long-term resource. This new approach hopes to cultivate a more vibrant, decentralized ecosystem, where multiple teams pursue specialized goals that collectively advance the Dash network.

### 50:00 - 55:00 Other Q3 Projects and DIPs

Here, the panel highlights additional work undertaken during the quarter, from confidential transaction proposals to improvements around private send features. They mention experiments in DIPs (Dash Improvement Proposals) that aim to broaden what’s possible within the Dash protocol. Confidential transactions, for instance, promise greater privacy by obscuring amounts while still maintaining verifiability.

The group underscores that these advanced features, while not guaranteed to roll out, showcase the network’s willingness to explore new directions. By incorporating feedback from the community, they maintain a forward-looking approach to evolving Dash’s capabilities. It’s a testament to how the community fosters both incremental upgrades and more groundbreaking initiatives.

### 55:00 - 63:43 Wrap-Up and Future Directions

In the final segment, the participants recap their key points and look ahead to the next quarter. By reiterating the Incubator’s plan to scale down direct funding and instead empower independent proposals, they confirm a significant shift in strategy. They see this as a way to distribute responsibility more evenly while amplifying the Dash network’s innovative potential.

Each panelist leaves with a sense of optimism. From improved Explorer tools and wallet integrations to new application concepts, the group underscores a collective desire to make Dash accessible, functional, and appealing for developers worldwide. Their closing remarks highlight the broad consensus that a more decentralized and self-sustaining Dash community is well within reach.

## Transcript

[00:00] Welcome, everybody, to today's show. Today, we're doing the quarterly report for Q3 of 2024,
[00:10] with a little look ahead to quarter four, what we each plan to do. And
[00:10] you'll notice that I've
[00:19] got Mikhail with us. How's it going, Mikhail? Hi. We've got Jojo Byte with us,
[00:19] Incubator.
[00:27] Both of these guys, I guess, I wouldn't necessarily say former Incubator strategists,
[00:34] but kind of. We'll talk about that in the show. And we've also got this
[00:34] strange new guy that some
[00:40] of you may remember from our previous show, CryptoTura, aka BJ. How's it going, BJ?
[00:46] Yeah. Hi. Thank you for having the show. It's going good.
[00:49] Yeah. And we'll talk about why he's here a little bit later on as well.
[00:49] It has to do
[00:55] with my strategy going forward with the Incubator in general. And so he's kind of
[00:55] the token symbolic
[01:04] example of that, at least one example of hopefully many to come. And actually, I'll
[01:04] probably just jump
[01:12] right into that. I'm going to probably talk for a few minutes about my overall
[01:12] strategy in the Incubator,
[01:20] what I think we should be doing going forward. We've got a proposal up. There's
[01:20] only one proposal
[01:27] this quarter for Incubator. And that is what we expect in the coming future. At
[01:27] least that's the
[01:36] foreseeable future is that we'll only have one proposal from the Incubator itself. And hopefully
[01:42] others will be submitting their own proposals. So Jojo Byte is on in part to
[01:42] discuss what he did a little
[01:53] bit in the past quarter. So this is actually a report for the most part
[01:53] of what we did in the last
[01:59] quarter. But it's also look ahead. So we'll Yeah, one thing that one thing that
[01:59] I wanted to, to go over
[02:10] as I guess what I'll do is share my screen. But before I do that,
[02:10] I'll get it ready with dash central,
[02:17] well, we'll just dash central.org. I don't have my history on this browser. So got
[02:17] to type everything
[02:31] manually. And budget. And okay, share my screen.
[02:40] Let's share my screen. Okay. Can you guys see this? Okay. Yep. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:40] Okay. So here's,
[03:08] here's our proposal and my proposal requesting 450 dash. Won't read this, but I will
[03:08] just show it on
[03:17] screen pretty short right now. I'm going to probably put this video as part of
[03:17] it as well. But in a
[03:23] nutshell, what I want to do is instead of having, I want to make the
[03:23] incubator more of an incubator,
[03:31] meaning that there's a short time that you you land in the incubator for a
[03:31] very brief time, and then
[03:37] the main goal is to kind of get you off the tubes and into your
[03:37] own life as an independent proposal
[03:45] owner. And that's what Mikael you've, you have led the way on this, you have
[03:45] your own DFO and own
[03:55] successful proposal, which we'll go ahead and show as well.
[03:58] So this dash central is not easy to get fonts, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
[03:58] But I guess it's a good way to get your, your main titles very big.
[03:58] So looks like you've got a lot going on. Very, very thorough proposal.
[04:24] Didn't lose any text. Yep. Yep. So what I wanted to do is I want
[04:24] to submit, I want to do a little demo to begin with. Oops, don't need
[04:24] to show the code necessarily. But what I want to do is one thing that
[04:24] in the incubator, or in dash in general, I think it's, it seems like it's
[04:24] a lot of things that I want to do.
[04:46] I want to do is to submit your own proposal, because to do so, what
[04:46] you have to do is, you have to get the first thing you have to
[04:46] do is know where to look. So if you find yourself in the documentation, and
[04:46] you can figure it out eventually, but you'll find out that you need to submit
[04:46] full node.
[05:02] One, one way to do this is to go to proposals dot proposal dot dash
[05:02] dot org, and submit this I'll go through I've gone through this in more detail
[05:02] before. So I'll kind of breeze through this but you can, you can, you can,
[05:02] you can figure it out eventually, but you'll find out that you need to submit
[05:02] full node.
[05:16] And you'll find out that you'll find out that you'll find out that you'll find
[05:16] out that you can get your proposal set up this way.
[05:34] But what you'll find is when you actually create the proposal.
[05:38] Hey, hey, one.
[05:46] Oh, it's gonna need to, let's just just do this. Let's just do this real
[05:46] quick.
[05:53] Insight dot dash dot org.
[05:56] Oh, yep, slash insight.
[05:59] That should be redirected automatically.
[06:02] Yeah, let's get a valid dash dash address here.
[06:07] And throw it in here.
[06:11] HTTPS colon slash slash my prop dot org.
[06:22] And you'll get you'll get some wallet commands that you can copy and paste into
[06:22] the dash.
[06:31] core wallet.
[06:32] So then, then you got to figure out how to get your own dash core
[06:32] wallet going.
[06:37] So it's just a few steps.
[06:39] You got to get, you got to get funding.
[06:41] So I want to make this process a lot more simple because I'd like to
[06:41] have more, a more diverse set of people submitting proposals to get started with things.
[06:52] And there's a lot to be said about how, whether people should be relying on
[06:52] the dash budget system.
[07:00] But ideally, in an ideal world, the whole dash Dow would be somewhat of a
[07:00] mix between incubation, even in the future, potentially even a loan system, which I won't
[07:00] go into now, where people are submitting proposals for loans instead of grants.
[07:17] I won't go into that now, but that's longer term vision.
[07:20] But at the first, the first thing is to make this process easier so that
[07:20] you can do the whole proposal submission thing through a web app.
[07:30] And that's, that's my focus moving forward is I'm going to create an app that
[07:30] makes this easier and I've already got it going to some degree.
[07:45] And I just wanted to demo that real briefly just because I'm excited about it.
[07:50] And I think it's, it's fun.
[07:51] I won't go into the details about how it's working yet, but I'm hoping it
[07:51] works.
[07:57] Right now it's kind of hard coded to just one address instead of submitting a
[07:57] custom proposal and it's working on testnet right now.
[08:06] These, these right here that you're seeing, this is the web app that's hosted at
[08:06] proposals dot dash platform dot app.
[08:14] And I hope to have another separate website that gives people the ability to easily
[08:14] host their applications on this sub domain.
[08:27] So instead of proposals, you'd have like cryptoturas app dot dash platform dot app or
[08:27] anything.
[08:37] And it would be, it would be meant to be a place to easily demo,
[08:37] just pay, pay a little bit of dash and click a button that says host.
[08:46] And then you pay, you pay some dash and then you've got your, your, you
[08:46] point it towards your GitHub account with the application.
[08:53] And then the application builds it in the background and hosts it lots to be
[08:53] said there as well.
[08:58] I won't go into the details there.
[08:59] But this, this is one example of an application that could be hosted on, on
[08:59] here.
[09:04] It's proposals dot dash platform dot app.
[09:07] And right now it's just grabbing the proposals that are on testnet.
[09:14] And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to prepare a new proposal
[09:14] just to show that it's actually working on testnet.
[09:20] And again, it's hard coded to a certain private key that has just over one
[09:20] dash on it.
[09:26] Now I haven't done this for about a week.
[09:28] I got it working before I went to the, to the permissionless conference, which was
[09:28] the last three days, which was awesome.
[09:37] I might talk a little bit about that if I have time, but I'm going
[09:37] to go ahead and prepare this.
[09:42] Like I said, I don't know if this is going to work.
[09:44] It was working last week when I was working on it.
[09:49] And right now it's I think it actually worked because the transaction sent and it's
[09:49] now pulling the network to see when this transaction makes it into a block.
[10:05] And we'll, we'll go ahead and I think that that can take up to, well,
[10:05] it takes one block to recognize it on the network.
[10:15] And then it takes six blocks for the proposal to be created as a governance
[10:15] object on the network.
[10:21] So we'll just let that go in the background while, while you Mikael take the,
[10:21] take the wheel for a minute.
[10:29] And if this is successful in the end, we will see a proposal that is
[10:29] today's date, which is October 14th.
[10:37] So you'll see a proposal similar to this one, October 14th.
[10:42] Anyway, let's, let's switch over to you now, Mikael and go over the proposals that
[10:42] are the projects that you funded in the last quarter and what you have.
[10:56] Yeah.
[10:57] So what happened in the last quarter?
[10:59] Can I share your screen right now or should I share my screen?
[11:02] Yeah.
[11:03] Yeah.
[11:04] Let me share my screen.
[11:05] Okay.
[11:06] So what happened, uh, in the last quarter is, sorry, real quick, just, uh, if
[11:06] you could zoom into just to your little section there so that people can see
[11:06] a little better.
[11:20] Sorry.
[11:21] Um, command plus, there you go.
[11:26] Um, yeah.
[11:27] Yeah.
[11:28] So, um, the one, the, the, the most big change is that, uh, we scaled
[11:28] up and there are right now five developers, including me, uh, working as a team.
[11:42] And, um, and, um, and yeah, and the tip is, uh, delivering good.
[11:48] They delivered a lot of things.
[11:50] There was a lot of changes, uh, on the platform explorer, both on the backend
[11:50] and on, on the UI.
[11:57] So this project is really going, uh, really well.
[12:01] Um, it has very frequent updates right now.
[12:04] So we regularly push backend changes, uh, front end changes.
[12:09] Um, so you can literally see, uh, how it's now, how it now looks like.
[12:15] There are really a lot of updates, uh, on the homepage, uh, there is a
[12:15] new, new design.
[12:24] So we got a new UX designer, uh, which, uh, right now helps us, uh,
[12:24] with such stuff, uh, uh, like designs.
[12:34] So he, he does really, he had really, really, really good experience in building, building,
[12:34] uh, applications, uh, and designs.
[12:42] So he, very experienced, uh, yeah.
[12:47] So, uh, yeah, so that's, that's a good thing.
[12:54] Yeah.
[12:55] Uh, that's really good thing.
[12:57] Uh, right now we have much more capacity to deliver stuff and we have really
[12:57] good UX designer that, uh, allow us to build really modern applications.
[13:08] Like we see in other projects like ethereum and stuff like that.
[13:13] Um, that's, that's very, very good news.
[13:17] Uh, anyway, uh, let's start from the platform explorer.
[13:20] Uh, I wanna show you just, uh, uh, going through the pull request one by
[13:20] one.
[13:27] Uh, so, um, I think the quarter started some, somewhere just a little before, uh,
[13:27] the platform started on, on the mainnet, uh, which is, uh, the early August.
[13:40] Yeah.
[13:41] So there was a lot of backend changes.
[13:44] So our backend guy really got himself, uh, into it pretty much deep and he's
[13:44] doing good.
[13:56] Um, uh, so the most, like the theorist, uh, major change was, uh, to query
[13:56] the state.
[14:05] Uh, so for example, the balances or some other stuff in the project, um, it
[14:05] was depending on some database structures.
[14:14] Uh, now we have all actual data on the platform explorer everywhere.
[14:18] Like the balances, uh, balances everywhere is quiet.
[14:22] It's getting quiet from the state.
[14:23] Uh, we built the epoch, uh, the epoch block.
[14:29] Uh, the backend epoch info.
[14:32] It requires, uh, it required us, um, well, there was some issues, um, in the
[14:32] SDK, there was some missing things and something wasn't working.
[14:42] So, uh, yeah, we proposed changes in the main platform code and, uh, they included
[14:42] that into the release and we were able to show it correctly.
[14:53] Um, we reworked, uh, uh, what else was there?
[14:58] Uh, what's there?
[14:59] Uh, yeah.
[15:00] A lot of, uh, info in the validators that were missing, like 40X info right
[15:00] now we have in the backend, which allow us to show some core level.
[15:09] Like, so we can show L1 addresses on the platform explorer, which will be implemented
[15:09] pretty much soon.
[15:17] Average, uh, digs, uh, per second, uh, which is now getting showed, uh, on the,
[15:17] uh, I don't remember where.
[15:27] Uh, on the transactions page, I guess.
[15:29] Uh, uh, uh, uh, ah, yeah, in the blocks.
[15:36] So there should be an average.
[15:39] It's not probably, ah, it's working right because there are no transactions.
[15:44] So, uh, it shows, uh, transaction per second, uh, for the last epoch, for the
[15:44] current epoch.
[15:50] Uh, anyway, um, uh, let me get back to Google class.
[15:58] Yeah, so the most, uh, interesting thing right now, uh, is that, uh, we are
[15:58] finishing the validator page on the platform explorer that should give, uh, master node all
[15:58] the detailed, uh, information about, uh, what his node.
[16:16] Uh, let me get through, for the, let me open the preview page.
[16:21] So, yeah, uh, me and designer, uh, sat together and just deeply had a deep,
[16:21] uh, deep discussion about how, how can we, uh, so I collected all of the
[16:21] information that could be provided to the validator.
[16:43] Uh, and he put everything into design.
[16:50] It was, it was just working together pretty much, pretty much hard.
[16:54] Yeah.
[16:55] So right now we have really, really good page and we plan to, to change
[16:55] other pages like identity page, data contract page, transaction page, blog page as well.
[17:06] So it will also meet, uh, this modern design.
[17:10] This is looking really, really pretty cool.
[17:13] So, uh, you have a balance, uh, right.
[17:16] You could, as when you get to the validate, your validator, you can see your
[17:16] protects hash.
[17:21] You can see a balance.
[17:22] You can see when this was created, when the, when it was first appeared in
[17:22] the consensus.
[17:30] Um, you can see, uh, blockade.
[17:35] I don't know what blockade means here, but anyway, we will think about this.
[17:41] Uh, your identity address, uh, which, uh, which is the identity of your validator, uh,
[17:41] and your public node ID.
[17:51] And this is related to tender dash network.
[17:53] You can also see the status of your, of your node, of your, uh, if
[17:53] your node is responsive, there is a P2P, uh, core P2P, platform P2P, and your
[17:53] PC section.
[18:05] Uh, so you can always, uh, check if something is going wrong with your node.
[18:12] Yeah.
[18:13] So.
[18:14] Yeah.
[18:15] And these, uh, things about your, like for the current epoch and the total reward
[18:15] search.
[18:22] So it shows, uh, the rewards that you should collect.
[18:26] Can you zoom in a little bit more?
[18:28] Uh, yeah.
[18:29] Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
[18:30] Yeah.
[18:31] Thank you.
[18:32] So I was just about to ask that too.
[18:36] Yeah.
[18:37] So, um, yeah, so you can see the rewards that you expect to earn, uh,
[18:37] during this epoch.
[18:45] Uh, it is based on your proposed block.
[18:47] So, uh, the more blocks you propose, the more transactions, the transaction fee you earn.
[18:53] Um, so it shows the last proposed block, which people, uh, searching, uh, very often,
[18:53] like,
[18:59] this information, like, they get in the mastermind approach.
[19:02] Uh, we can also see, we can also, we also show the withdrawals count.
[19:08] Uh, which shows amount of your withdrawals and the last withdraw, which should be pretty
[19:08] much useful.
[19:14] We show also some information about, uh, L1.
[19:19] Uh, so such as collateral address, owner address, voting address.
[19:23] It will lead you to the Insight Explorer or any other book explorer.
[19:29] Yeah.
[19:30] Uh, here we have a chart, uh, which is now highly configurable.
[19:36] I don't know if it's working yet.
[19:38] No, it's not.
[19:39] Calendar.
[19:40] So once you click on the calendar, uh, you should see a calendar where you
[19:40] can set a custom timeframe.
[19:46] Uh, yeah.
[19:49] So, uh, yeah.
[19:53] Uh, I think the most noticeable change that, uh, that hourly timeframes, uh, are being
[19:53] removed
[20:01] because they're not really making, uh, much sense.
[20:05] So you can click and set any date you want and it will give you,
[20:05] uh, all the data.
[20:12] Here we can have different tabs.
[20:13] For now it's just proposed blog transactions and withdrawals.
[20:16] Uh, probably wish we can add something, uh, else here too.
[20:21] Yeah.
[20:22] So the list and all of the data are right now looks pretty neat and
[20:22] like have a nice, nice designs.
[20:30] Um, has anybody, do you have a page that shows withdrawals, uh, for the whole
[20:30] network or does, does that happen to have any?
[20:38] Um, well, well, uh, it's leading, uh, to the transaction page, but it's not, uh,
[20:38] it's not done yet.
[20:45] We have already a design for, uh, for it, uh, let me show you.
[20:51] Let me show you transactions.
[21:09] And have you seen it.
[21:10] Oh yeah.
[21:11] Or done it.
[21:12] So, so it will look some, something like, like that.
[21:15] So, uh, yeah.
[21:20] With draw, there should be with draw.
[21:22] Yeah.
[21:23] So it will look something like that.
[21:25] Uh, when you click on the draw, you will see all of the information during
[21:25] transaction.
[21:29] You can see a role transaction.
[21:30] You can see an asset lock.
[21:32] Uh, uh, I'm not sure if asset lock is, uh, is there in the withdrawal
[21:32] or yes.
[21:41] Should be asset unlock for the withdrawals.
[21:43] Right?
[21:44] Yeah.
[21:45] Yeah.
[21:46] Yeah.
[21:47] And it should be asset unlock.
[21:48] Uh, um, actually the platform team also messed up the naming in the code too.
[21:54] So, uh, we realized that like maybe two weeks ago that it's actually asset unlock.
[22:00] Yeah.
[22:01] So yeah.
[22:02] And you can see the details where are you withdrawing.
[22:05] So there should be like our withdrawal address.
[22:09] Yeah.
[22:10] We will like make the design more clean.
[22:15] Uh, so when, when we are actually developing, uh, and then do you have a,
[22:15] do you have a graph
[22:22] that will show, uh, you may have already shown this, but do you have a
[22:22] graph that shows like
[22:26] the, the balance of.
[22:28] Yeah.
[22:29] Yeah.
[22:30] I think, uh, I don't, I don't think I can show the balance at the,
[22:30] at the, at some time,
[22:36] but we can show a river earned by the investor note.
[22:40] So that, uh, depends on how much block, um, this validator proposed and how much
[22:40] transactions
[22:47] fees are there.
[22:48] So it will show you a graph, which shows you to acquire that.
[22:53] I know that, um, MNO watch.org slash.
[22:58] What's it, what's the route on that?
[23:02] MNO.org slash something, uh, platform or validator shows that what I'm, what I'm talking about.
[23:11] So cool.
[23:12] Yeah.
[23:13] Yeah.
[23:14] But this is specific to the specific, uh, validator.
[23:18] I mean, uh, even though it's, uh, on the, I'm gonna watch, watch, uh, uh,
[23:18] shows the overall
[23:24] of all of the notes.
[23:26] Yeah.
[23:27] So we also have designs for specific transactions.
[23:33] Um, so we did all of the transitions, including, uh, the master dot voting.
[23:39] You can see the choice that was made, uh, uh, like if you are, if
[23:39] you are voting for a name,
[23:49] you can see this transaction.
[23:51] Um, if you query it by hash search, search by hash, this is the credit
[23:51] transfer.
[23:58] Oh, sorry.
[23:59] Again, well, I think I should show something like that.
[24:06] Yeah.
[24:07] This is the voting.
[24:08] We did roll top up.
[24:14] Uh, they look pretty much same.
[24:18] There are just, uh, the details, uh, the, the details of the transactions just, uh,
[24:18] had such
[24:24] different format, but more rubber, they are look the same.
[24:29] Uh, yeah.
[24:32] Uh, this is an interesting one cutting, uh, which is the documents bench, uh, which
[24:32] shows
[24:41] the actual data, which being posted, uh, into, to the plot platform.
[24:45] For example, this is the document create, uh, which shows you the data that being
[24:45] posted.
[24:53] Uh, pin post, um, document type and the data contract identifier.
[24:58] You can click and, uh, you will be redirected to the data contract.
[25:03] Uh, document replace, which is, uh, document update, document delete, uh, document transfer,
[25:11] uh, implemented NFT as, as well.
[25:14] Uh, data functions for NFT, uh, document purchase, uh, who are buying document for which
[25:14] price.
[25:22] It's buying the document, uh, and document update price, which is used, uh, to set
[25:22] a price on
[25:29] your document.
[25:31] Is that a form specific feature at this point?
[25:34] Or is that using your indexed database?
[25:37] Uh, it's a platform feature.
[25:39] Okay.
[25:40] Okay.
[25:41] So we found the protocol level.
[25:42] So in the protocol level, there are, um, a method for setting, uh, document price,
[25:42] and then
[25:49] you can buy it, uh, the network from the community.
[25:52] Okay.
[25:53] Okay.
[25:54] I thought I remembered seeing, um, uh, I'm following your repositories and I, I thought
[25:59] I remembered seeing something about, um, there's not support yet, or maybe it was just
[25:59] in the
[26:04] JavaScript SDK, uh, for pricing documents.
[26:08] Can you?
[26:09] Yeah.
[26:10] Yeah.
[26:11] Yeah.
[26:12] So I have added the support in the indexer, uh, follow these same transitions, but
[26:12] we can't
[26:15] really, uh, execute those transitions from the JS SDK yet.
[26:20] I have been able to execute them through RAST SDK and I was able to
[26:20] make a document transfer
[26:27] through, uh, JS SDK, uh, via self written bindings.
[26:33] So I'm going to finish all, all of this up.
[26:36] Um, and we will be able to execute transactions, uh, eventually, uh, through the JS
[26:36] SDK everyone.
[26:44] So yeah.
[26:45] Okay.
[26:46] Uh, that's the stuff I'm missing.
[26:49] stuff missing here from the gsdk which yeah uh what else was there uh the
[26:49] strategy is uh just
[27:00] a fee for my managing my projects which going through which is is going through
[27:07] the single better rules uh xd5 integration uh was used as uh uh integrating uh
[27:07] dash in their sdk they
[27:21] are renamed to control or stuff like that yeah so is that something that you'll
[27:21] be following up with
[27:32] is there anything that you need to do on that or is that is the
[27:32] ball on their court at this point
[27:36] um yeah it didn't uh it didn't go as well as uh as we thought
[27:36] uh because um at the point uh guys was
[27:46] be very busy with the transition and then it gets forgotten and stuff like that
[27:46] i think we should
[27:53] ping them once again and maybe update the code that i submitted through the pull
[27:53] request and yeah i think
[28:02] it's uh i think we will solve that uh uh like anyway um yeah so
[28:02] that's another example of of one type of
[28:15] a project that you know i if you if you are not working on that
[28:15] or whatever or even if you are that's
[28:24] something where maybe we reach out to them and we just say hey can you
[28:24] can you submit your own proposal
[28:32] for 20 or 30 dash or whatever you need to to get this going and
[28:32] um you know we'll we'll get you paid
[28:39] through the network instead of any other organization i think that that's uh it's kind
[28:39] of it's it's a good
[28:46] thing from both sides both from the dash side and from their side to see
[28:46] like this is how i can
[28:52] actually really get funded through dash the dow um and that that's kind of exciting
[28:52] stuff that i i don't
[29:01] know how to do that kind of stuff but that's i want to look into
[29:01] it i'd love to see more independent uh
[29:09] companies uh third party companies completely outside of dash you know seeing a proposal from
[29:14] them for small amounts of just you know uh integration work so anyway um moving
[29:14] up moving on
[29:26] um yeah so uh the next thing that we work through is uh dashboard from
[29:26] developer air articles so we
[29:37] submitted uh i don't remember one or two articles uh uh on the medium um
[29:47] which is uh about dashmate evanote uh i guess it should be google google google
[29:47] um yeah
[29:58] so it's another guy in in our team uh so he went through the dashboard
[29:58] uh product and and posted a
[30:13] really descriptive uh guide how to deploy a evanote so you can uh follow this
[30:13] up and
[30:20] it's and uh have a running evanote it goes through everything uh from getting a
[30:20] fancy and uh
[30:29] yeah how to register you how to register your vps how to set it up
[30:29] how to make all of the keys this is
[30:41] pretty important i think because uh yeah yeah because people
[30:47] can follow it and you know they have they have a lot of questions using
[30:47] the dashmate yeah so it
[30:54] helps them yeah if somebody interface itself yeah some random person is just googling
[31:01] how to set up an evo node you know medium's got a ton of seo
[31:01] so that that's something that uh
[31:08] will at least get them started yeah uh we were thinking that about making an
[31:08] article about dash
[31:15] sdk as well uh but right now we're focused on some other things right now
[31:15] okay uh another thing that i
[31:22] would like to show you is uh another project that we we're building uh looking
[31:22] forward to this yeah uh so
[31:34] so yeah the full set so the idea is that actually it's kind of experimental
[31:34] in research project
[31:41] right um and uh yeah so we were researching uh how to pull uh i
[31:41] mean um it's like
[31:56] it's researching it's like a good thing in the marketing way to have to pull
[31:56] to make users uh
[32:03] okay we let me i'm trying to explain so yeah the current uh faucet um
[32:13] is not like very handy uh it has it's not working pretty reliable and we
[32:13] thought the way that uh we allow
[32:22] people to claim some destiny coins uh but in order to claim them uh they
[32:22] they should authenticate through
[32:32] some of the socials and if they claim too much uh right you can just
[32:32] use uh if they claim too much uh
[32:41] they get through the process of uh like make a comment uh in order for
[32:41] you to uh to claim your coins so
[32:54] it's a good thing because uh it will attract accounts into dash like you know
[32:54] uh the more followers we have
[33:03] uh the more the more the more traffic we get and it's a good thinking
[33:03] and it was also experimental
[33:09] project uh with uh one of our new developers so yeah yeah he made he
[33:09] he made pretty good stuff and we
[33:22] researched how to make authentication through different uh socials and yeah it's not uh completed
[33:22] yet so
[33:32] we gotta grab it for a while because um we experienced budget shorts and also
[33:32] uh there was
[33:40] more important words uh on the platform explorer yeah but uh it shows you the
[33:40] interfaces that we
[33:48] are now able to build like it's very very very cool it's very easy to
[33:48] use and uh yeah yeah it looks
[33:58] it looks great and you know faucets have been historically just a terrible experience um
[33:58] and
[34:05] that's that's bad because the first thing that people need to do as a brand
[34:05] new dash developer is
[34:12] get testnet funds so if the first thing is some website that's breaking all the
[34:12] time and working yeah
[34:20] what's that what's left to do here is just to connect it with the backend
[34:20] which is not written yet so we
[34:27] just need to finish the backend and uh yeah finish this up so we will
[34:27] do it uh a bit later uh yeah uh
[34:37] website and infrastructure which is uh used for infrastructure for my infrastructure mainly but we
[34:37] also have a website
[34:48] so on the uh website uh we have a new feature that uh let me
[34:48] check if it's not merged yet uh yeah but
[35:10] yeah but basically it's uh i don't remember on the password wait a second
[35:22] so yeah um we're preparing our website uh for some content uh that will be
[35:22] posted into the platform and
[35:33] for that we need a new like an interface for creating the posts um
[35:39] second admin admin
[35:46] yeah so
[35:51] the idea is that uh we can just uh put some info here and just
[35:51] press save and when it's saved it gets pushed
[36:01] to the platform and then when you're visiting the website you can see all of
[36:01] the all of the content
[36:09] uh straight from the platform so we don't need to hard code it uh into
[36:09] the front and build yeah yeah so
[36:16] we got it uh but we are kind of got back through with the dash
[36:16] sdk so was dash sdk have all necessary
[36:26] things and things and we are not slowed down so we will we will do
[36:26] it um yeah so
[36:34] what else uh yeah we fixed uh a linux build for the electron dash
[36:41] uh which is now working there was some issue uh some unidentified issue uh some
[36:41] guy in the internet just came over the repository and proposed his uh
[36:54] proposed the solution and there was a task for it already so he claimed it
[36:59] yeah there was also uh contributions to the boris to the both dash platform dash
[36:59] car
[37:06] dashboard platform contributions uh our backend guy when the test problem with the dash sdk
[37:06] for some methods
[37:16] um he just fixed the james dash sdk and suggested the changes uh in the
[37:16] main in the main platform code
[37:24] and they were accepted so it was uh used to pay him and uh dashboard
[37:24] contributions is the
[37:31] backwards or backwards that vj is working on uh yeah okay so if vj is
[37:31] still awake uh maybe that's a good time to
[37:42] uh to bring him on and uh discuss what he might be uh proposing uh
[37:42] so vj are you still with us
[37:50] yeah yeah yeah yeah i am yeah awake okay so uh looks like last quarter
[37:50] we have this um
[38:00] we have this project in the incubator dash core contributions you've been working on doing
[38:05] btc backports um it looks like 42 dash went your way last quarter i think
[38:05] that uh this quarter has that
[38:16] been historically about this about this the amount that you've been doing or is that
[38:16] low or high compared
[38:22] compared to what you've been doing in the past because that would be about 12
[38:22] or 15
[38:28] uh dash per month but i think that you've done a little bit more than
[38:28] that in the past
[38:35] yeah yeah i mean this uh last quarter i am
[38:42] almost like 50 60 dash 50 dash almost a month uh worth 40 to 50
[38:42] dash a month
[38:50] in general so this is this is showing for a quarter right that's showing for
[38:50] for the whole quarter yes
[38:57] yeah yeah so this is uh low actually yep okay so um now we obviously
[38:57] could continue to fund this kind of
[39:09] work uh michael's not going to be doing uh incubator work moving forward but i
[39:09] could pick this up and
[39:17] you could continue working under under me however i don't really do much uh i
[39:17] don't add much value in
[39:27] terms of reviewing i don't add any value in terms of reviewing uh btc backports
[39:27] that's all done by dash core
[39:35] group so to me it would make sense to have you just directly have your
[39:35] own proposal uh submitted to the
[39:41] network and if uh if master node owners and and dcg and people value this
[39:41] work of having outside
[39:52] contributors submitting um backports or even just any kind of dashboard contributions i think that
[39:52] you should
[40:01] be submitting your own proposal for that um and what what do you say are
[40:01] you do you plan on doing that
[40:08] yes yes yes okay great um yeah go ahead yeah i was planning on that
[40:08] line sorry
[40:19] yeah so this this quarter i know that uh there's only about five days left
[40:19] in in this month um but for for
[40:29] voting uh so do you plan on doing that next month yes yes okay so
[40:29] everybody be on the lookout for that
[40:38] not sure exactly what uh amount you'll be requesting but you know just just kind
[40:38] of look over what what
[40:45] what we've done funded historically in the incubator whatever you want to to target is
[40:45] is up to you just
[40:53] it's kind of like it's more of a pass fail when you are submitting your
[40:53] own proposals so it's important
[40:59] to not request too much but also make sure that you're getting what you need
[40:59] and we'll we'll see how that
[41:06] go ahead and see how that goes um do you have a list of backports
[41:06] that you have that have successfully
[41:14] been merged in by chance or is that something that you would probably i guess
[41:14] that that's a link that
[41:19] you would want to put on your own proposal but do you have that ready
[41:19] right now to review or did you
[41:23] have anything else to share about this uh i have the links uh which i
[41:23] have merged recently
[41:29] recently okay should we look at that now or should we just have people wait
[41:29] and look at that on your
[41:36] upcoming proposal we can have a quick look right now okay um do you want
[41:36] to share your screen or do
[41:45] you want me to just send me the link and i'll pop it up on
[41:45] my screen uh let me just show let me just
[41:54] show uh i have all the links okay great yeah i think you're already sharing
[41:54] your screen mikhail so just
[42:02] go ahead when you're ready this one
[42:32] uh would i show here the code you can see yeah i was i was
[42:32] thinking more of like looking through the
[42:46] the pr list like um github filtering is not intuitive to me so i don't
[42:46] i wouldn't remember how to do the
[42:55] filter well uh pull request doesn't have any descriptions so it's mostly yeah you can
[42:55] do an
[43:06] author though um something along those lines but i think in this for the sake
[43:06] of time we can just leave
[43:13] that until the proposal unless anybody really wants to dig it up right now uh
[43:13] just any final thoughts
[43:28] vj on uh on what work you might want to do do you want to
[43:28] expand uh do you plan on expanding beyond
[43:36] backports have you done anything beyond backports or is that kind of your bread and
[43:36] butter
[43:42] uh backports is the um of course is the main thing which i have been
[43:42] doing uh some time back uh i was
[43:49] trying with mikhail to do something else uh but then somehow we could not uh
[43:49] move forward it in on that
[43:58] yes mikhail you remember that sometime sometime back yeah yeah the project is also wasn't
[43:58] so great
[44:06] yeah so backport is the backport is the main thing which i do which i'm
[44:06] doing for last you know last
[44:14] 2021 last three years i'm doing backporting mainly i do have i mean i am
[44:14] interested in
[44:22] collaborating more or adding more value to it but i'm trying to figure out where
[44:22] i can
[44:31] add more value apart from backports okay all right well i think backports is a
[44:31] good way to start since
[44:37] that's something that you've uh had you know successfully merged in at any rate so
[44:37] um yeah um
[44:46] jojo bite do you want to jump in now to to talk about your stuff
[44:46] or should i
[44:54] sure go ahead first okay um yeah let's switch up the screen share real quick
[44:54] uh or actually uh do you
[45:03] mind since we're already sharing your screen oh no you it's okay it's okay okay
[45:03] oh i guess uh now
[45:11] now that i'm looking back you're not sharing yeah okay so just scroll over a
[45:11] little bit yeah there's
[45:20] just a few things that you've worked on the last quarter you also have built
[45:20] up a budget because of
[45:25] that so it's not like we've been we've been paying you to do nothing we've
[45:25] been uh building up a buffer
[45:31] which is is nice uh so yeah tell us about what you've been working on
[45:31] um so aj had done quite a bit of
[45:40] or maybe i should say cool aj 86 has done quite a bit of work
[45:40] on the incubator libraries um i don't
[45:49] know if he's done much this past quarter i know he did a little bit
[45:49] but a lot of that was
[45:54] uh rollover from the previous quarter um so i think he had done the work
[45:54] and then made the claims
[46:03] in this quarter but yeah something like that in any case um i've also done
[46:03] quite a bit of work on the
[46:11] wallet ui and uh those are other than the libraries and the the wallet ui
[46:11] that's been most of the work
[46:21] as far as the libraries go i had actually asked aj for an update but
[46:21] uh i i don't think he sent me
[46:31] anything yet so yeah i think a lot of this work was done early in
[46:31] the quarter so it's been quite a while
[46:36] since yes between either one of you doing uh much on this however um you
[46:36] will likely at least from our
[46:48] previous discussion be submitting your own independent proposal coming up as well and
[46:53] uh so i just wanted to give people a heads up on that as well
[46:53] that you know all all these people in
[47:00] the incubator that have been working either as strategists or just as contributors um and
[47:07] more beyond that is like i'm i'm encouraging everybody to to have submit your own
[47:07] proposals
[47:14] and i'm i'm going to be trying to make going to try to make that
[47:14] as easy as possible by uh using that
[47:20] that web application uh that i'm that's in development to make such proposals a very
[47:20] streamlined process
[47:30] um so if you don't have if you wanted to say anything else i know
[47:30] i kind of just brought you
[47:34] in here with short notice um just to make sure that the community knew that
[47:34] you were still alive
[47:41] yeah um but there's not much to say in this past quarter but did you
[47:41] want to say anything else
[47:47] yeah so so i know this is where since i didn't do the work for
[47:47] aj's stuff i'm not as familiar with
[47:55] everything he got done i know some of his stuff was related to um uh
[47:55] coin not coin join uh
[48:06] is it coin join it is coin join right that's what he was working on
[48:06] a few months ago i think
[48:14] um and so he's done a bunch of work on that as far as my
[48:14] stuff goes for the wallet ui um i've been
[48:23] working on a crowd node integration and i have uh a lot of that done
[48:23] but i think when there there was the uh
[48:33] up in the air stuff happening with crowd node i kind of backed off and
[48:33] i started to do a refactor
[48:41] so now i'm mid refactor on the wallet ui and in the middle of the
[48:41] crowd node uh integration and uh
[48:51] i will likely be moving the wallet like as you were saying ryan we're trying
[48:51] to shift away from the
[49:00] incubator so the wallet ui will eventually be in its own project um i don't
[49:00] know if we'll move the project
[49:08] or i'll do a fork of some sort and just fork it into a new
[49:08] project but a lot of the stuff that i've been
[49:15] working on and i'm thinking a lot of the libraries and whatnot will be um
[49:15] moving or forking into new
[49:24] projects where they'll be maintained and who whoever built or is willing to maintain them
[49:24] will be putting
[49:33] forth proposals to for that maintenance or more upgrades because there are quite a few
[49:33] under the
[49:40] dash incubator right now that i'm not sure you want to stay there if you're
[49:40] not going to have people in
[49:46] the incubator specifically working on them yeah i think i think people when when people
[49:46] have more
[49:54] direct ownership over their projects there just seems to be better outcome overall so so
[49:54] yeah that is
[50:00] definitely the direction that i i want to head um and i guess with that
[50:00] i i might want to unless you have
[50:10] anything else to say i'll jump into real briefly talking about what i funded in
[50:10] the past quarter and
[50:15] what uh i'm moving forward with um yeah so to wrap up my little part
[50:15] is i will be putting forth a at
[50:25] least one proposal maybe a few we'll see i'm trying to determine with aj if
[50:25] we'll do joint proposals going
[50:33] forward for our team or if we'll do completely separate proposals as individuals that maybe
[50:33] there
[50:40] will be a little bit of crossover but aj will request his budget i'll request
[50:40] mine but i will likely be
[50:47] shifting away from just pure dash stuff and maybe trying to do actual products like
[50:47] bring in things that
[50:57] you can use as alternatives to uh current current uh things you're actually paying you
[50:57] know fiat for but
[51:07] could be paying dash and using platform so i will be shifting more towards using
[51:07] platform if possible
[51:14] and um building on top of that and building some of the ideas i have
[51:14] so it will be more of a shift from
[51:23] away from libraries and uh dash specific to dash dash using or dash adjacent stuff
[51:23] so that that's my gist and
[51:34] take it from there right yeah i think i think that's a good approach as
[51:34] well um that's we want to we want
[51:42] to get people off off of treasury and into real world um income revenue generating
[51:42] products in general if we can
[51:53] but things that are more or less public goods i think those are still good
[51:53] candidates for um you know
[52:00] open source work are good candidates for uh dow funding so i'll go ahead and
[52:00] switch to my screen share now
[52:07] and go over my list
[52:11] okay and i'll i'll do this quickly because i think we've we've covered a lot
[52:11] of this already
[52:22] um the the main thing that we funded last quarter was this proposal library and
[52:22] web app and most of
[52:31] that was the library side that was that was funded through me but the work
[52:31] was done mostly by aj
[52:36] um and speaking of which i i want to jump back over there to see
[52:36] if this actually completed it looks like
[52:47] uh it did over here so let's refresh we should see another proposal on this
[52:47] list so we have eight now
[52:53] we refresh this our logs will go away but we should see another proposal on
[52:53] the list so it should be nine
[53:00] and sure enough nice um looks like this is the new one so from 10
[53:00] 14 16 21 that's when we started the show so
[53:09] working on testnet um need to get the user interface updated so that you can
[53:09] receive a payment uh through
[53:18] uh through a qr code or what's actually on my mental roadmap at least is
[53:18] putting all of this so all of
[53:28] the med the idea here is that all of the metadata so when when i
[53:28] click new the the user experience would
[53:34] be i click new i put a title in my my new proposal and uh
[53:34] this is markdown so you'd put in markdown here new
[53:48] a new proposal let's say uh btc backports something like that um i'm vj i
[53:48] and i love doing backports
[54:08] something like this and then you'd click done and then you'd have a list of
[54:08] proposals here that you're
[54:16] drafting and then you'd have the ability to um to submit them to the network
[54:16] um and so you wouldn't
[54:25] need a dash central account even all of the the data and the metadata would
[54:25] would live on dash platform
[54:32] and uh further idea would be that you could fund you could try to um
[54:32] what's the term uh crowdfund the
[54:43] one dash proposal fee so if people like this they have dash platform usernames they
[54:43] can they can tip
[54:49] you like you know uh 0.5 dash uh worth of credits and then this is
[54:49] all kind of stuff that we would use
[55:00] to show how dash platform integrates with dash core submitting proposals so i kind of
[55:00] like this idea i
[55:07] actually really like this idea i'm very excited to keep working on it that's what
[55:07] we did uh we funded
[55:12] that a lot of the the library work under the hood um last quarter and
[55:12] then the web app part of it i did
[55:21] some of that um that's a small part of this incubator updates is the show
[55:21] platform tools we've also been
[55:30] been trying to get um a lightweight lean just uh a library just just to
[55:30] integrate with platform uh
[55:39] communicate with platform we've talked more about that in the past uh we'll probably continue
[55:39] doing
[55:46] that to some degree uh as well web i don't double click on this to
[55:46] see what this was uh oh this this
[55:57] was a lot of the platform walkthroughs that we did early in the quarter i
[55:57] think um and some other work as
[56:03] well uh so uh transaction city this is another one of those projects that instead
[56:03] of having me continue
[56:17] we we worked on this with the tx city guys they got uh i guess
[56:17] we probably don't have time to like
[56:26] bring it up and go through it again but watch the previous show on transaction
[56:26] city all that's working
[56:31] all that's integrated right now is dash core and it has um it has private
[56:31] send and coin join
[56:38] transactions uh get their own little house so you can check that out um he
[56:38] would like to do plat a
[56:45] platform integration as well so i will encourage him to submit his own proposal for
[56:45] that uh and i think
[56:53] that that would be a great visualization to show okay here's how dash platform integrates
[56:53] with dash core
[56:59] and you can see transactions going to and from um platform and core using the
[56:59] asset lock and unlock
[57:07] transactions uh and we'll probably have him on the show uh once if he decides
[57:07] to submit his own proposal
[57:14] on that uh private send jsdk we did some work on that and payment tools
[57:14] updating our payment tools for
[57:21] support for other things like the js sdk i think there were some updates that
[57:21] needed to be to be done
[57:28] there uh this dash platform dot app that's uh that's my work on getting that
[57:28] site this site hosted and
[57:38] with support for subdomains and things like that um did a little bit of rules
[57:38] updates apparently i don't
[57:46] remember exactly what that was but um just what about it was about um about
[57:46] dependence and trello
[57:54] the what dependent yeah oh aj and i could do get up right right right
[57:54] right yeah just uh yeah some minor
[58:06] things there um dash incubator org this was probably some kind of infrastructure or just
[58:06] uh organizational
[58:15] things not much going on there we did have we did fund uh uh a
[58:15] dip that joelle spearheaded uh found a
[58:25] developer that is submitting a dip for um let's see i i'm gonna just go
[58:25] into this real quick let's see
[58:37] this was
[58:39] let's find it here
[58:46] let's see
[58:55] i just want to show this on screen just so people can see it it's
[58:55] not i don't think it's
[59:00] not it's not submitted to the dash pay repo yet but
[59:05] it's interesting stuff around confidential transactions um by this duke leto guy um talk to
[59:05] joelle if you're
[59:18] more interested in this and i'll just i'll just show this on the screen people
[59:18] can read it
[59:25] um so uh what what what this is a protocol or what uh this is
[59:25] this is a dash improvement proposal
[59:35] in draft phase uh for doing confidential transactions on dash and i think that how
[59:35] it's different from the
[59:49] uh uh coin join it's um uh coin join um uh coin join but it
[59:49] gives the ability to basically show like uh
[60:02] uh it obfuscate the amounts so you wouldn't see you'd see um uh coin join
[60:02] but it gives the ability to basically show like uh
[60:13] uh obfuscate the amounts so you wouldn't see you'd see transactions coming in and out
[60:13] but you wouldn't
[60:22] necessarily see the amounts uh this is yeah ask joel and and and read that
[60:22] uh and then he just texted me
[60:31] he just texted me about this thing okay cool let's see where where were we
[60:37] uh just spritz expenses i've decided to make our own proposal our own little item
[60:37] for that just when
[60:47] when i'm doing things that uh i'm using the spritz card incubator infrastructure
[60:53] um hosting or something i i don't recall exactly what this one is as well
[60:53] but uh this this these
[61:02] were meetings from all of our past adi stuff that i decided to pay myself
[61:02] for and distributed thumbnail image
[61:11] service this is another one of those things the 10 dash was just the getting
[61:11] started part
[61:16] um when you use dash pay you have you're able to uh submit a photo
[61:16] and we've
[61:26] been using a project called dash a distributed thumbnail image service that we've that we've
[61:26] built
[61:34] in the incubator so dash pay kind of relies on this so we needed to
[61:34] get it updated um
[61:42] and uh may re is the developer that was working on that this this 10
[61:42] dash was just to get started we
[61:48] did some more work in the beginning part of this quarter that's not shown here
[61:48] but that will be in q4
[61:54] and i think that that's very close to being done if not done already so
[61:54] that's my list um
[62:04] i'll just i'll just show real quick uh ash's work he was unable to join
[62:04] us today but he's been doing
[62:12] some work on the discover dash web and uh just the typical project management strategy
[62:12] stuff
[62:18] so that's it um let's see go back to screen yard here and yeah thanks
[62:18] for um thanks for giving those
[62:30] updates just we went over an hour we had a lot to discuss today but
[62:30] in a nutshell uh yeah i'm in the in
[62:38] the incubator i'm going to be trying to uh get people to submit their own
[62:38] proposals and uh have ownership
[62:47] over those and i think that's a good way forward so trying to help with
[62:47] that as much as possible
[62:53] uh anything else to say guys um well uh uh yes this is my last
[62:53] proposal um so yeah i would like to say
[63:06] that uh it was fun to work with the incubator so right now i'm going
[63:06] on with my own dfo so
[63:13] please vote for me comment and write you know uh yeah we really need that
[63:13] support so yeah the the
[63:22] platform explorer has you know and i know that that's been maybe i don't know
[63:22] 80 80 plus percent
[63:30] of your work and that's absolutely necessary for anybody to to do anything in platform
[63:30] so
[63:36] yeah really glad you were able to pick that up and and take that um
[63:36] all right with that thank you
[63:43] everybody see you i'll see you thank you see y'all thank you bye-bye
